PRELIMINARY NOTES ON 
A MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF MANPOWER TRAINING PROGRAMS 

The purpose of this paper is to present specific human ability 
derelopment models in order to analyze the ability d07elopnent function 
of oanpover training. Ability dereLopment, of course, is one of tND 
aain training functions. Socialization is the other. Roughly speaking, 
an individual is socialized vhea he not aaly knows what is eaqpeoted of 
hint and vhat he can expect from others, but also iihen he accepts the 
roles defined by these expecta^ons. Training, in this paper, is then 
conceived of as a process vihloh develops the abilities necessary to 
fulfill such eixpectations, and the first task will be to inquire into 
the nature of ability dereloisaent. 

The General Model and Specific Cases 

Let A(t) and C(t) r^resent the amount and maxJiaam possible amount 
respecti-vely of any specific ability at time t. At t = 0, let C(0) = C^, 
Ignoring fatigue, attention span, and motivational effects for t^e 
moment, assume that the time rate of change of ability ia aa^ aaviroqmeot 
rffa"Arlrf the exercise of ^^t ability is as given in the equation 

For exanrple, suppose the ability in question is the ability to solve 
ordinary differential equations. Then in the absence of formal tr ainin g 
in differssitial equations, a specific individual may be characterized by 
k > if he has had previous expertence with calculus and k » if he has 
had no previous experience with calculus. Formal training may increase

k to k*>k>0. 

Equation (l) is a first order linear differential equation as 
can be seen upon rearrangement to 

It embodies the basic assumption of this paper that the rate of change 
of ability is directly related to the difference C(t) - A(t), i.e., 
dA(t)/dt decreases as C(t) - A(t) decreases. The factor k will be 
given different interpretations in the discussion ithidi follows. For 
now it can be regarded as a constant of proportionality. 

Assaming that k is a constant, the solution^ to equation (2) is 
given by 

where u(t) = axplj k dx { = e^ and x is a duanny variable. In the case 
at hand

and it is clear that the solution depends upon ^atever auiditional 
assunrotions are made concerning C(t). 

Case l! C(t) = C^ 

The singxLest assto^tion for C(t) is that it is a constant function 
of time, i.e., C(t) = Cq. Equation (3) tien resolves to

Differential Eauat3.ons (New York: Wiley, 1970), pp. 7-18.

is obtained. 

It is nov dear that given the assttn^tion C(t) » C^, a standard 
learning theory assun^tion, ' the value of foraal txaining votild be 
difficult to detect unless k were very small and oould be significantly 
enhanced with foxmal training. Otherwise, the approach to maxismm 
ability, Cq, takes approxiismt^y th© saa© amount of tins nith or 
without formal training. 

Case H; C(t) « Cq and R g k(t) 

On the other hand, suppose k were very small and srsl^jeot to the 
InfLuesioe of foxmal training. Then k would also be a fonstion of t 
and equation (2) would become

continuing with the asstm^ion that C(t) » Cq, Now A(t) depends upon 

additional assuoptions for k(t) as well as C(t). A rather innocuous 

a8SUD?)tion for k(t) is that it is a monotonically increasing fonction 

of a form that approximately satisfies the dlffereotial equation

^ere c^, O2>0 are constants. That is, although k(t) increases 
with t, it increases at a decreasing rate. Solving for k(t),

seen to be identical eoccept for the constant B » (c^/c2) + k. 

This last result is particularly useful in that is pentdts a 
simple derivation of the total increase in useful abili"^ over a long 
period of tiae. The total increase in useful ability is given by

for large values of t. Substituting B = (0^/03) + k,

(22) 'R - ^oKc^lITc^J ^ ^o(cf^y =

Thus, even under the restrictive assun5)tion that C(t) «= C^, the 
intuitive feeling (and oftentiiaes obserTahle result) that foznal 
manpower training is valuable has been made perfectly dear. The 
total increase in useful ability, R = C^j/k, mast be very la^pge unless 
Cq is v«:y small. 

The step from the assui^tion that C(t) = C^, a coaastant, to the 
altesTsativQ assuiqytion that C varies with time, of course, is a small 
one. Various functional fonas for C(t), such as those resulting from 
solutions to dC/dt = coe"^"^ and dC/dt = Cet/(C - Cq) where o«, c^, Cc, 



and C(0) = C^ are constants, can be substituted into equation (2) 
and the consequences determined. The factor k may or may not be 
assumed constant daring such an eocereise. 

Another alternative assun^jtion to C(t) = C is 

and it has more intuitive appeal than arbitrary substitutions for 
C(t) in equation (2). In other words, siiqply assume that the rate 
of change of the maximtm possible amount of any specific ability is 
directly proportional to the rate of change of ability. A physical 
analogy to this hypothesized psychological i^enomenon uould be the 
process of pouring water into an ©cpansible container such as a 
balloon. The balloon has an initial capacity C^, but its capacity 
increases under the weight of the water, 

C(»BbiJ3ing equations (i) and (23) with the initial conditions 
A(0) =0 and C(0) = G^ leads to the ssrstan of first order linear 
differential equations

Notloe that unless p =: 1, the amount and naxiBium possili^e amount of 
ability do not increase without limit but to C^/d - p). The 
distribution of p and k is discussed in the following section. 

Before reTiewing l^e conclusions of the analyses in these three 
oases, consider the systan (2^) written with p and k as variables, i.e.. 

System (2?) is the case %*iere p and k are subject to the influence of 
fomal training. Differentiating the first of th^e equations and 
substituting the second into the result yields 

(28) ^ ^ -^ C€)[!- paq ^^k'Ci)A^k 'a) c 

Equation (28) can be simplified by relying upon approximations 
similar to the one posited in equation (9). Thus, assuming tjiat 
variations in p and k are similar under the influence of formal 
trajjiitsi;, the factor k(t)L 1 - p(t)j can be approximated by the 
prodact of two constants, k*(l - p*). This result, not elaborated 
here, leads to the farther approximation that k»(t) « 0, and 
equation (28) becomes 



Then, using the initial conditions that A(0) = and A'(0) = k^C^, the 
solution to equation (29) is given by 

The similarity between this result and equation (25) is not surprising 
given the similarity already obtained between equations (6) and (17). 
And, if the effect of training is to bring p* close to 1.0, its 
consequence is a rather spectacular increase in the final level of 
ability, via,, 

(31) jr^ - jr^ = ^- L/T-vr/'V 

Again, this last result can be sii^lified by noting that if p*a*1,0, 
then pp* - psO.O. Thus, 

(3=) Tip - T^ - ^-^ /-f'J 

For eocaiBple, suppose p = 0.5 and p* = 0.99. Thai pp* = 0,495 and 

ppf» - p «j -0.005. This yields an increase in the final level 4f ability, 

over and above what it would have been without formal training, of

Conclusions 

The first conclusion that can be drawn from the preceding 
analyses is that the training effect is to shift the ability development 
curve upward and to the left. This is obvious \6i&n. con^ring equation 
(17) in Case II with equation (6) in Oase I and equation (30) with 
equation (25) in Case HI. The Case m upwai^i shift, of course, is 
more dramatic than the Case II shift. This conclusion may be intuitively 
obvious, but intxiition is not always so reliable in the face of critical 
analysis. In this respect, a Ivss intuitive conclusion is that the 
standard learning theory assuntptions embodied in Case I make many 
training programs difficult to Justify. Unless k, the rate of developni«it, 
is very siaall and subject to the influence of training, asy manpower 
training program would appear to be a bad investment. 

The deveLopment in Case HI is an obvious alternative to Case I, 
and it leads to equation (32) which is the increase in the final level 
of ability over and above irtiat it would have been without formal training. 
In the process of obtaining equation (32), however, the constants p and k 
in equation (25) were not fully discussed. It is not difficult to show 
that in order to be consistait with equation (1), a reasonable hypothesis 
is teat 0<k< 1. The same hypothesis must hold for the constant p xailess 
one is willing to believe that ability grows without limit or decreases 
as ii result of training. Sometimes ability does decrease as a result of 
training, aig., brainwashing may decrease an individual's powers of 
'iiscrimJUiation. For normal training purposes, however, it would seem 
reasonable to assume that both p and k lie within the open interval (0, 1), 



11 



Thus, prior to training some population of individuals has one 
distribution over the unit square, say S, described hj 

After training this pop\d.ation has another distribution over the same 
square. 

Returning to equation (32), it is obvious that the most valtiable 
training programs are those that focus on individuals with low p values 
and increase these to p* values which are dose to 1,0, Even the beet 
training program is worthless if the average value of p is already 
close to 1.0, Thus, assuming that ability and performance are 
reasonably weU correlated, simple measures of increased proficiency 
are insufficient for comparing different training methods. The worst 
possible training method, for example, will not look too bad ^en 
compared with a good one if both methods are tested oa grox;Q>s teat have 
high p values. 

The development of methods for measuring p and k is then one of 
two main problems for further study. Elaborating on the theoretical 
foundations established in this paper is the other, and further 
elaborations may indicate some reductions in the magnitude of the 
measurement problem. Notice that p and k measureanaits in themselves 
are a definition of an individual's intelligence or capacilgr to learn 
in terms of a rate of developmait, k, and a constant of proportionality, 
p, between dC/dt and dA/dt, Lastly, further theoretical develoixnents 
should begin to include the motivational, span of attention, and 
fatigue factors ignored in this paper as well as the financial 
considerations xmderlying trainiiig programs.
