1. The laws of operation of any algebra are ultimately based upon its 
definitions. If the definitions are geometrical the algebraic operations have 
geometric correspondences. The operations of addition and subtraction in 
common algebra, for example, correspond to the geometric addition and 
subtraction of straight lines, vectors, surfaces, etc. 

In this algebra new definitions of vector multiplication and division are 
adopted, in consequence of which all algebraic operations upon vectors 
(directed unlocated straight lines or steps), or rather upon vector symbols, 
correspond to geometric operations in space upon the vectors themselves ; 
and every algebraic vector expression con-esponds to some geometric 
configuration of the vectors themselves. 

In every vector demonstration or problem, therefore, the student may 
think in terms of either algebra or geometi-y or both ; and may at any time 
change from one realm of thot to the other with no break in the continuity. 

This algebra is developed first in terms of analytical geometry for 
three-fold space, and is then adapted to two-fold and to four-fold space. 
Complex numbers, spherical trigonometry, and quaternion rotations, appear 
as special cases. 

2. NOTATION.— Taking three rectangular axes X, Y, Z, let x, y. z 

denote unit vectors (steps) outward from the centre 0, along the axes. 
Unit vectors in the opposite direction from are denoted by x, y, z. 
Vectors in general are herein denoted by black faced Gothic capitals, and 
the corresponding unit vectors by black faced italics. For purposes of 
designation and operation all vectors (unless otherwise indicated) are under- 
stood to start from O, the centre of coordinates. 

Then if A is any vector, a is its length, a is unit length of the same 
vector, a^ x, a,, y, a, z aie tie vector components of A along X, Y, Z, and 
flx, Qy, fl, are the lengths of these components. 

Then A = aa 

— a^ X -\- Oy y -\- a^ z by vector addition. 
d^ ^= a'i -\- d'y -\- di by solid geometry. 

The symbol A is used to indicate (1) the vector from O to the point 
whose rectangular coordinates are «^, Oj, o, ; (2) motion from O to the 
extremity of A ; (3) a rotor, defined in ^7. 



Z A, GSOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 

The Ine or locus of A is expressed by an elongated A thus /A, and 
any part of this locus, from m to n, is written ,,,/a. Surface loci are 
ordinarily expressed by two I's and solid loci by three is. 



3. To express the cosine of the angle between two vectors in terms of 
the coordinates of the vectors. 

Let c be the length of the line joining the 
extremities of the vectors A. B, fi-om O. 

By solid geometry — 

c2 = (a, - Z>J2 + (o^ - Z>y)' + (o. - by 

By plane trigonometry — 

c'' = a- -\- b' - 2ab cos A B. 

a^ b^ -\- Gy b^ -{- a,, b.,. Sab 




Fig. 1. 
Therefore, cos A B = 



a b ab 

where Sab =^ the sum of the a b products ^ ab cos A B. 
If S,.i, = O, A B. and conversely. 

Example 1. — Find the angle between the vectors x + 2y and 2x-y-|-c^. 
Here S ^ 0, and the vectors are perpendicular. 

Example 2. — What angles does the vector 2x - y -(-z (= A) make with 

the axes x, y, z ? 

2 -1 1 

a = ^ G; .: cos A X = ^ Q , cos Ay = j 6 - cos Az = ^6 • 



4. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION.— Addition is geometrically 
defined as the piocess of making the second vector step from the extremity 
of the first. ^ he sum is the new vector from O to the extremity of the 
second vector thus added. 

Algebraically addition is performed by resolving the vectors into their 
components and adding these. 

A + B = (a, X + Qy y -[- a, z) + (A, x + Z>, y + b,z) 
= (fi^^bj X + UJy-\-b,.) y + {a,r{-bj z. 

Subti'action is addition of the negative of a vectoi-. 

Hence, both geometi-ically and algebraically vector terms are commut- 
ative. 

A B = B + A. 



A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 3 

5. COLLINEAR VECTORS.— Two vectors A. B, are in the same line 
when 

A EEE nB, 



Ox 

67 






If n is positive, A and B are in the same direction ; if negative, A and B 
are opposite. \i n — \, A. ^^ B. 



6. COPLANAR VECTORS.— Three vectors, A. B. C. are in the same 
plane when another vector, K, can be found which is peipendicular to each 
of them. Then S^k = S^k = Sek = 0, by i^3. Eliminating k^, kj,, k^ we 
get the coplanar equation 

\a,byC^\ = 0. 

The determinant ' a^ h, c, is six times the volume of the tetrahedion whose 
corners are O A B C. When this volume is zero A, B. C. are coplanar. 

Example. Find the conditions under which A is jjeipendicular to 
C= X + z, and in the B C plane where B - 2x - y, 3. 

The condition of perpendicularity is 

S,., = 0, or a^-\- a^ = 0. 

The coplanar equation is 

2 -, 3 
1 1 

flx Oy Oi 

Ther^ore A = o^ (r - y, 3- z). 



= 0. 



7. MULTIPLICATION of the vector B by the vector A is written 
A B, and is defined geometrically as the combined oi>erations, 

(1) Extension of B until its length is ab, 

(2) Simultaneous rotation of B thru 90^ about A as an axis, in a 

direction which is right handed or clockwise when facing in 

the positive direction of A. 
Each vector multiplier is a tensor-rotor. The rotor power of all vectors is 
the same and needs no separate expression at this stage. 

The product AB is that vector from O whose extremity is the final 
position of the point B after extension and rotation. The locus of AB 
is the curve traced by the point B during the operation. 

ABC means the operation of A on the product BC, or 
ABC m: A. BC. 
Also A" B ^ A. AB. etc. 



A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 



It next becomes necessary to find the laws of algebraic multiplication 
that correspond to the geometric changes here defined. 

8. Multiplication by a collinear vector makes no change except in 
length or sign, 

XX = X 

XX = X 

XX = X 

X X = X 

Aa = A, etc. 

9. Unit perpendicular vectors give the following results which are 
geometrically evident. 

xy — z ,xy = z 

y xz = y xz = y 

xy— z xy = z 

xz = y xz = y 

and similarly for y and z as operators. 

X 

Here the laws of signs are the same as 

in common algebra, so long as the factors 

are in alphabetical circular older; 
Fig. 2 

xy = z ^ xy, 

xy ~ z ■= xy =— xy. 

But reversing the order of the factors changes the sign of the product ; 

xy — z 
yx = z. 
The second power of an unit perpendicular operator is equivalent to -1, 

x-y = xz ^ y 
x^y = X z = y. 
The fourth power leaves the operand unchanged, 

X V ^ x-y ^ y. 
When the vectors are not units the product of their tensors is pi-efixed to 

the vector product, 

ax. by^ab. xy — abz. 

10. To find the algebraic product of any two vectors. Let the product 
be K = AB. Draw KD l O A, and OV 
equal and parallel to D K. Then the length 

OD is 

D = K cos A K 

=aZ> cos A B 

= Sab, bg >?8. 

As vectors 0K = 0D + DK, 
or K = S,,, a + V. 
Fig. 3 




A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 

To determine V we have the equations of perpendicularity, 
Sav = o„ v^ -\- Oy Vy + a, v^ = o 

Sbv = ^x i'x + ^y i'y + ^2 i'z = O, 

and from the triangle O D K, 

i>l. -\- v\ -\- vl =^ V- ^ a-b- — S-. 

Solving we get 

y^ ^ Oj. Z>2 — Oj^by 
Vy ^= a^b^ — a„b^ 
v^ = a^by — Qyb^. 

Hence the "Vector Normal" to A. B, is 



V = 



QxOy 


Oz 


b.by 


b. 


X y 


z 



and its length is 



V = y a'ti'-^'' = ab sin AB. 



The product K is thus expressed in terms of the given vectors and 
their components, in the equation 

AB =r Sa + V. 

Example. Find the product AB when 

A=3y — Jf, B = 3*-y. 
Here S = -6, V = 8x, o = , 10, 

... AB 8x -^--i?(3y-'2). 
5 

11. PERMUTATION OF FACTORS. It is geometrically and alge- 
braically evident that 

Sab ^^ Sba 

and that V.b = - Vb.- 

Hence B A -- Si,,. i> + V^, 

= Sab to - V.b 
which is not equal to A B. 
Changing the order of the factors changes the vector p»«oduct. Vectors 
are not permutable. 



12. OPERAND DISTRIBUTIVE. To find the product A (B :- C) 
let B - C = D. 

so that </^ = Z>x — Cx 

dy = by — Cy 

d^ = b^ ± Cj. 



6 A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 

Then A (B + C) = AD 

-- S^d a + Vad 

= (Sab ± Sae) a + V,b ± V,e 

= (Sab a + V,b) ± (Sac a + V,,) 
-^ AB ± AC. 
The operand is therefore distributive. 



13. OPERATOR NOT DISTRIBUTIVE. To find the product 
(A ± B)C, let A t B = K so that 
k, = a,± b, 

ky = Qy ±: by 

A^j = Oz ± K 

k^ = d" -\- b-" ±. 2 Sab, by §3. 



and 

Then 



(A 



B)C = KC 

= Sue #f + Vke 
Sa. ± Sb 



1 a- + Z)^ zt 2 S. 
which is not equal to AC ± BC. 
Hence the operator is not in general distributive 



(A ± B) + (V. 



Vb.) 



14. FACTORS MUST.NOT CHANGE ASSOCIATION. 
A B C = A (Sbc b + Vbc) 



= -^AB 
b 



AV. 



%-|^' A+^V3b+ U.A.c.la + SaeB-SabC. 



To expand A B. C, let K = A B, so that 

A B. C = K C = S,, If + Vk 

i Sab ^a 



a 



— -\- \ a^byC^ 



a b 



V. 



+ 



Oj. b,, \ , \ a^ b^ 
Cx Cy 

X y 



Ox by 

c. 



which is not equal to ABC. 

Hence the association of a factor must not in general be altered. 
But if C = A these two products become identical, and therefore 
A. BA = AB. A. 



- A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 7 

15. POWERS OF AN OPERATOR. 

AB = Sa + V 

A'B = A. AB = A (Sa + V) 

= SA + AV 

= 2 SA — a^B by expansion and multiplication. 
A^B - A (2SA- a-B) 

= 2 a^ S a - aM S a + V) 

= a^ (Sa — V), which is geometrically evident. 
A'B = a^ Sa - oMSa - a-B) 

= a* B, which is also geometrically evident. 
From these results it is easy to write the expansion of any value of 
A"B when /J is a positive integer. 

16. LAWS OF MULTIPLICATION, summary. 

(1) Factors are not permutable (>;11) 

A B is not equal to B A. 

(2) The operand is distributive (?512) 

A (B it C) = AB - AC, 
but the operator is not (??13) 

(A B) C is not equal to AC ^ AC. 

(3) The association of a factor must not be changed (f;14). 

A. B C is not equal to A B. C 
but A. B A AB. A. 

(4) The fourth power of an operator is equivalent to the 
fourth power of its tensor (^15). 

(5) The common laws of signs are true for opera ' and 
product ; not for the operator. 

17. PERPENDICULAR VECTORS. When A.B.C are perpen- 
dicular, S,i. = S^c = Sh, = o, (?$3), and AB = V, (jilS). 

Then the laws of J;16 become the following: 

(1) Permuting the factors, i.e., interchanging operator and 
operand, changes the sign of the product. 

B A = Vba = - Vab = - A B. 

(2) Both operator and operand are distributive. 

(A = B)C = AC rt BC 
A (B ± C) = AB = AC. 



8 A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 

(3) The association of a factor must not be changed. 

A. B C is not equal to AB.C. 
but A. BA = AB. A. 

(4) The square of an operator is -1 times the square of its 
tensor. 

A'B = — a-B. 

(5) The common laws of signs hold true. 

If a, b, c be any three unit perpendicular vectors in the 
same circular order as x, y, z; then ab = c^ be =^ a, 
ca ^^ b, and these vectors may serve as units of the 
system, as well as x, y and z. 

18. DIVISION is the inverse of multiplication, so that if 

AB = C 

C 

^ = A-C=B. 

Geometrically, division is a negative turn of 90° about the divisor 

(identical in this respect with multiplication by the negative of the divisor) 

and reduction in length to that given by the quotient of the tensors. 



19. GENERAL FORMULA for A" B where n is real. 




Let OA, OB, be the vectors 
A. B, and let O C be in line 
with their vector product, so 
that A" B = a" times OC. 

Let BCT be the circle of 
revolution of B about A; N 
its centre; N B, NO, its radii. 
Draw CD j NB; DE || BO. 
Let . CNB = (^ = ;7^ be 
the angle of rotation of B. 



Then NC = NB = -, where v is the length of V^,, 

n 



D C = ^ S//J 6, 

D E = B O ^g = ^ COS (y, 

OE=DBj;^ = ^ vers 0. cot A B 



= ^ vers B. - = ^ vers 0. 



A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 9 

As vectors OC = OE + ED + DC 

S v 

= a vers d + B cos d + - sin 6 
a a 

.: A" B = a". O C 

= a"' (Sa vers 6 + a B cos d + V sin $). 

This formula, being true for all real values of n, includes products, 
quotients, powers and roots of vector operators. 

Example. — Two rods, A and B, are joined at one end. A is one foot 
long, and the peip3ndicular distance of its free end from B is six inches. 
B is turned 60° about the axis of A, then A is turned 90° in the same 
direction about the new axis of B. Find the new position of A. 

Let the joined ends be at O. Let B = bx, and A a^ x -\- a^y. 
Since a — 1, and Oy = |, A = J (x i 3 + y)- 

The result of the first rotation is represented by 

C = A^B= Sa vers 60° + B cos 60° + V sin 60° 

== «' (7x + y , 3 - 2x , 3). 

The second rotation is 
c A = S c + V,, 

= 1 (9x , 3 — 3y - 2i), 
which gives the final position of the free end of A. 



20. QUATERNIONS. 

When A J B, S = 
and V = AB. (f;17). 

Then A"B = a" (B cos ^ + a B sin ^) 

= a" (cos ^ a sin H) B. 

Now a- as a perpendicular operator is equivalent to -1; and by ex- 
pansion in series, exactly as with the complex {cos d -{- i sin H), it may 
be shown that the rotor of A" 

cos 6 ^a sin 6 = e**^ 
where is the angle and a the axis of rotation. , 

Hence for perpendicular vectors 

A"B = a"e"^ B. 



10 



A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 



The operator A" is a tensor-rotor-vector, or a directed quaternion, 
when applied to vectors perpendicular to A. It has the four funda- 
mental characters of a quaternion, namely. 



C, A" may be regarded as the ratio of 



(1) Since A" B 
C to B; 

(2) It is the product of a tensor and a directed rotor, a", e 

(3) It is the sum of a scalar or number and a directed unlocated 
line or vector, a" cos 8 -\- a" a si.-t 0; 

(4) It is a quadrinomial of the form k -{- I x -\- my -\- nz, where 
k is a pure number and the directive units x, y, z, have the 
relations 

x^ = y- = 2- = xyz = — I. 



21. VECTOR ARCS. The rotor e*^ turns thru the angle a about 
the axis A any vector in the plane perpendicular to A. The index a is 
a vector angle whose axis is A and whose magnitude is a radians. The 
length of the subtended arc is a a. If this circular arc be taken as a 
vector, written a, it is understood that its angle is a, its axis A and its 
radius a. A vector arc may take any position in its own circle, and has 
therefore one more degree of freedom than its vector axis. 

Vector arcs need not be confined to arcs of circles, but whether the 
extension to other curves would be of any particular value remains to be 
seen. A rough classification gives the following: 

(1) Straight vectors, 

(2) Plane vectors, having single curvature. 

A. Conic, 

a. Circular, b. Elliptic, c. Parabolic, d. Hypeibolic, 

B. Spiral, etc. 

(3) Solid vectors, with double curvature. 

22. SUM OF CIRCULAR AND STRAIGHT VECTORS. 



Let the plane of the arc a 
meet the plane of A, B, in the 
line CC; let C be so chosen 
C that ^ B C is not greater than 
90°, i. e., so that n is positive ; 
and let a = c.

2 ( ' ' 2 2 * 

To this B is readily added. 

If B is parallel to A, C is indeterminate and any radius of the a 
circle may be taken as C. In this case the sum is a point on a right helix 
or screw whose axis is A. Since the addition may begin at any point of 
the a circle, tha sum is a screw vector whose radius, pitch and direction 
aie fixed. 

23. SUM OF TWO CIRC^ULAR VECTORS. Let a, B be two cir- 
cular vectors with a common centre O; and let C = V„,, be the intersec- 
tion of their planes. Let CBo = /i', C Ao = a'. 



Then 



a = A, 
B= B. 



Ao = (e'''+'* - £■''') a c, 
Bo= (e^'+^- e^')Ac. 



Any third circular vector 
whose position is deter- 
mined with reference to 
the intersection of its plane 
with the plane of a or B, 
may be similarly expressed 
and the sum readily found. 
In expanding these ex- 
pressions it is convenient to 
remember that 




Fig. 6

when C = V,^,, 

then AC = V„, = S^i, A — o= B 

and BC = Vi„ = A-' A — S„i, B. 

When S ^ a the sum is 

2a = a. 2a 

which is a vector arc with angle a and radius 2a. 

The locus of the sum of two equal vector arcs beginning at the same 
point of intersection, when the planes are not identical, is an ellipse. 

Also I (a — a) is a straight line. 



24. SPHERICAL TRIANGLE. Assume a sphere of unit radius, 
and upon it arcs of great circles. As an illustration of vector ti-eatment 
let it be required to find the relation between the sines of the angles of 
a spherical triangle. 




Let a, B, y, be three cir- 
cular vectors forming a 
spherical triangle ; a, b c, 
their vector axes; A', B'. 
C\ the vectors from O to 
the angular points; A, B, C, 
the angles of the spherical 
triangle.

The last expression is symmetrical in a, b, c. and therefore 

sin a *'^ /^ sin y 

sin A ~ sin B '~ sin C 

25. CONIC VECTORS are expressible in teims of the radius vector 
from the focus to each extremity of the segment of the curve. 



m B 




Let A be the axis of a conic, O it.s focus, 
N its directrix, P the radius vector, a. b 
the coordinates of P with reference to A 
and B: and let p = e (a -\- m), where 
e = is the eccentricity. 



- p- (1 — c') + 2cmp — m'-. 



Fio. 8 

Then a ~ cp — m 

b- = p^ — (f - 
.-. P ^ A + B 

^ {cp - /;?) a + /b, \p- (1 — C-) + 2cmp 
The conic vector from Po to P is P — P<j. 

P may also be expressed in terms of a, b, or 0. 

Thus 



m-']. 



a = p cos 0, 
b = p sin (j. 



c p = a -\- m 

= p cos 6 -\- m, 

m 
^ ~ c — cos ' 



P = 



c — cos 



(a cos 6 -]- b sin 6). 



14 A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 

If p is a constant, c =r /?? = oo , then for the circle 
P = p {a cos -{- b sin 0) . 

Similarly in any conic 

( /• „ r \ 2 ,.2 „2 , 

i' 



P = A + ,. r { (« + "^y - «' c' ^ 



Also P = ^—^ — 5—!— — ^^ ^ a + B, 

c^ — 1 

but when c = 1, in the parabola, 
P = —^ a + B. 

We have then an expression for any conic vector as the difference of 
two straight vectors, P = Po ; which may be expressed in terms of either 
of the variables, a, b or 8. 



The sum of two or more conic vectors would express approxi- 
mately for a short distance the course of a body moving under gravita- 
tional forces from two or more sources. Whether this method of 
calculating would be an improvement on present methods I am not 
prepared to say. 

Multiplication of a straight vector by a vector arc involves double 
curvature, and the locus of such a product is a convenient form by which 
to express solid vectors (§21). Again the utility is problematical. 

26. DIFF^ERENTIATION OF STRAIGHT VECTORS. Any vector, 
A, may vary in length and in direction. Its variat'on may be expressed 
in terms of a for length and a for direction; or it may be expressed in 
terms of the components A^, Aj., A^. 

Since the infinitesimal inciements of a vector are also vectors, it is 
evident that by vector addition 

rfA = ^, A + a,. fi< + d, A 

= X da^ -\- y d ay -^ zda^, (1) 

since x, y, z, are absolute constants. 

Also, d A = da A -{- d, A 

= a da -\- a da. (2) 

It follows from (1) that the differential of a vector is the sum of the 
differentials of its components, and hence that differentiation is distribu- 
tive over vector terms. 



A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 15 

It follows from (2) that the ordinary rule for differentiation of a 
product holds true for any unit vector and its tensor, and hence for any 
product of a tensor and a vector. 

27. To find the differential coefficient of a vector product, A"B. 

A" B = a"' (Sa vers (^ -{- a B cos H + V sin H). 

Differentiating both sides of the equation with ivspect to 0, =^ n~ , 

d 2 

^ A" B = _ A B.loga + a"'(Sa sin I) — a B sin N -^ V cos 8) 

'2 
= A"B loga + o" ' (cos + a sin H) V, 

since, by multiplication, Sa — oB=raV- 

The last term of the differential coefficient may also be written 
o"' e" V. It is a tensor and rotor product of V (the vector normal 
of A and B), whose rotation is about A. e° V expresses the rotation of 
V in the plane perpendicular to A. o" ' e** V traces a spiial in this 
plane, and as a vector it gives at any point the direction and rate of 
motion in this plane made by the point B, supplementary to the increase 
in the length of B. 

2 
The term _ A" B loga is a multiple ot the vectoi- product, and for 

any given value of n it expresses the rate and direction of the increase, 
in length only, of that pioduct. 

The sum of the two terms gives the rate and direction of the motion 
of the point B for unit increase in H. It is the vector tangent to the 

curve traced by A"B, namely, the curve /a"B. 

Example. — Find the tangent where the flat spiral (ox)", by cuts

This vector tangent makes at all times a constant angle with its radius, 
and its length gives the velocity of the generating point when the 
angular velocity is unity.

tangent, the curvature K is —7 , and the radius of curvature is

29. LINEAR LOCI are loci having only one degree of freedom; 
lines or discrete points. A few examples are given: 






+ B is any part of the straight line drawn from the 
point B in the direction A. 

"B + C. when A -L B, is a circle with centre C, radius 
b, and plane perpendicular to a. 



^l (A cos -\- B sin t^) ; C is an ellipse pai'allel to the 
A B plane. 

_^/(A"B + oC) includes a variety of curves. 

If A -L B, C II A, and a = 1, the locus is a helix. 
If C i A the locus varies from a circle (when c = o) 
to a straight line (when c = co), passing thru the cycloid. 
In other positions of C the helix is acute angled. When 
a^> 1 the curves are expanding and when a 1 diminishing.

32. THE REGION COMMON to two loci is found by equating the 
coafficients of x, y, z, in the expressions for the loci. If these equations 
are consistent, giving i"eal values for the variables, the limits thus found 
are inserted in either of the loci to give the required locus of intersection. 

Example \. — Find the region common to the straight line 

„l n X -\- hy, and the curve 

„/{a X + (2x + y) sin a j. 

Equating coefficients, 

n = a -\- 2 sin a 

i = sin a. 
Whence n = a -\- 1 =^ arcsin I -\- 1. 
Inserting these values, both loci become 

Jih y + X arcsin h) 
which is a row of discrete points parallel to :ir.

Example 4. — Find the locus of the intersection of the cube 
JJjla^x^ Qy y — a^ z) 
with a plane which cuts its diagonal 
A = X + y 4- z perpendicularly. 

Let B = X — y 

be one vector in the perpendicular plane, and 

C = V.b =x + y -2z 
the other. The plane is 

11(1 B mC+ nA) 

where n is an arbitrary constant expressing the fractional 
distance from O to the point where the diagonal is cut. 

Equate coefficients of x, y, z, in the two loci, 
a^ = I ' m -\- n 
Oy = — / -\- m -\- n 
Oj, = — 2 m ' n. 

Therefore / = — g—

If /2 = the plane goes thru O. Since a^. a^, o^, are all positive 
and the sum zero, each of them is zero, and the locus of 
intersection is the point O. 

If n = 1 the point of intersection is A. 

If n = J, so that Ox ; Oy + Oj = 1, while each varies between 
and 1 subject to this condition, the locus is an equilateral 
triangle whose corners are found by giving to a^, a^, a,,, 
separately the maximum value, 1, in the expanded expres- 
sion for the plane 

If n = § the locus is a similar' triangle. 
If /? = I the locus a I'egular hexagon.

If we now write /? = 0, I Ai, -{- m B \& the projection of K, made 
parallel to C, upon the plane of A. B. 

If A and B only are given, and the projection is desired of K per- 
pendicularly upon A, B, take C = Vai, = \ a^ by z \ , and proceed as before. 

To project K in the direction of C upon a plane perpendicular to C, 
take any vector A, -L C, so that Sac = 0, 
as, A ^ CyX — c^ y 

and a second vector B, = Vacr 



B =

Then express K in terms of A, B, C, as before.

34. PLA.NE ALGEBRA.. Every vector in the XY plane is of the 

form A = Ox ■* + «> Y 

= o^ X -\- Gy zx 
= (Ox + z Oy)x. 
Since x is a part of every vector expression of this form, it may be 
omitted. The remaining form, a^ -f- •* Oy. is a complex number. Since z'^ 
as a rotor is equivalent to -1, we may write this tensor-rotor in the 
common form o -|- ib (whare /- =-1), whose p.-operties are well known. 

Again, any vector in the X Y plane may be expressed as a z-product, 
thus, A = a z" X 

= a (cos 6 -\- z sin 6) x 

= a c'^ X. 
Omitting x as before we have left the other two forms of the com- 
plex number. 

Vector multiplication in the XY plane with any other rotor than z 
gives in general imaginary products, i.e., products lying outside of that 
plane. 

FOUR-SPACE ALGEBRA 

35. In four-space there are, by definition, four mutually perpen- 
dicular axes, X, Y, Z, U. These are so selected that they multiply in cir- 
cular order, as in 3-space. Each vector is now fully defined by four 
compansnts. Vectors are added and subtracted as in 3-space. 

As in §3 it may be shown that 

Sab ^= Ox 6x + Oy Ay + Oz ^z + (7^, A„ = O Z> COS A 3, 

where S„b is, as before, the sum of the a b products. 
Evidently also when S^b = 0, A '_ B. 

36. MULTIPLICATION in 4-space is defined as rotation about the 
plane* of the multiplying vectors, thru a right angle in the positive direc- 
tion. The planes of rotation are wholly + perpendicular to the axial plane. 

*Rotation is essentially plane motion. In a 2-flat the axis of rotation 
is a point. In a 3-flat the axis is a line. In a 4-flat the axis is a plane. 

tit is evident from §35, that in 4-space absolutely perpendicular planes 
exist. For A = a^ ■* + Oy y is any vector in the X Y plane, and 
B= b^z + b^u is any vector in the ZU plane. Since Sab= 0, A -i- B. 
That is to say, every vector in the XY plane is perpendicular to every 
vector in the Z U plane.

A GEOMETRICAL VECTOR ALGEBRA 



Multiplication of C by AB, is written ABC, and is defined as 

(1) Rotation of G thru 90" in the positive direction about the 

plane A B, and 

(2) Simultaneous extension to the length abc. 

By definition, xyz = u, yzu = x, zux = y, uxy = z. 

Re Timbering that the plane of rotation is perpendicular to the axial 
plane it becomes evident that 



xyu = z, yzx = u, zuy = x, uxz = y 

y xyz = u, yzu^^ x, zux ^ y, uxy = z 

lcyu = z, yzx = u, zuy = x, uxz=^y 



Fig. 9 

Coplanar vectors are unchanged in position by 4-space multiplication, 
because the whole axial plane is unmoved, 

xyx = X 

xy (a^x -^r Qy y) = a^x -\- a^ y.

The sum of any two terms of K is the projection of K ujjon their 
plane, made parallel to the plane of the other two vectors. 

Loci are projected in the same way.

the principal orthogonal projections* of the regular 8-cubed tessaract 
whose edge is unity, 



/;/:./;/k. 



upon the 3-flats about it. 



(1) Parallel to x, on the 3-flat of y, z, u, the projection is 
obtained by writing k^ = 0, giving the cube 



w\ 



(k,y-^Kz + k,u). 

(2) Parallel to x + y. Let x + y = D. 

To get three other rectangular vectors we may take 

A = z 

B = w 

C = Wabd = y — X. 

Then I — k,,, m — k^, n — -^—^ — ^ • 
Writing r = the projection becomes 

JJJ J] k.A + k^Bi^ "-"-^ C j . 
And a = 1, 6 = 1, c = i 2. 

To express this locus in geometrical terms we note first that since 
it contains three vectors, not coplanar, with independent 
variable coefficients, it is a 3-space solid ; and in the second 
place that the original axes, z, u, which are perpendicular 
to the line of projection, remain unchanged. The axes x, y, are 
each foreshortened in the ratio of i 2 : 1. Projecting x and 
y by the same plan as for K we get for the projections 
X' = iC 

making the total distance ; 2 along C. 

Consider next the variables in the locus, k^ and k^ are entirely 

independent, with limits from to 1, and [ [ (A", A ^ k^B) 
is a square in the A B plane. The solid is a right square 

prism whose extension along C is given by the last term 

ky - k,

namely, -J C; and the upper limit is ^ C. Since c = ^ 2, the

Parallel to x + y - z, (= D).

The figure is again a 3-solid ; the axis u, perpendicular to D, remain-

*' = - i C. 

The length of each of these is -^. This length may be found directly 
by the equation

The variable k^ is independent. The figure is therefore a right prism 
of unit length along A. To find the prism base, or section in 
the BC plane, draw the axes kB. hC and plot the figure. 




First, let k^ = ky = 0, while Ar, 
varies from to 1, tracing the 
line along C from — J to O, the 
line aO. Next let ky = i; the 
locus of k^is then the line be from 

B C . _B C 

~ 2 6 ^° 2^6- 

Intermediate values of ky fill out 
the parallelogram ac.

Next let k^— 1, and proceed as before, obtaining the parallelogram dC, 

B C B O 

whose limiting lines are de from o "" fi *'^ ^ ^ ^ ' ^^^ ^^ 

from O to IT . 

Intermediate values of k^ give similar parallelograms commencing at 
every point along a d and covering the regular hexagon ace. 

The whole projection is a right hexagonal prism. The projected axes 
x\ y\ z\ are Oc, Oc, Oa. 

(4) Parallel to x + y + ar + u, (= D). 
Take for the other rectangular axes 
A = X — y 
B = « — u 
C = ^ Wabd = x + y — i— t/. 

/(-, - A-, k,- k, k,^k,-k,- k, 
Ihen / = n — '- , m = ^ , n = — 7 , 

and the locus of the projection is 

7' 7' 7' V, ^x - k, k, - k, k, ' k,. -k, - /r, 

where a = b = ^ 2, c" = 2. 

Projecting the axes x, y, z,u, we get 

*' = i A + i C 
. yi = - JA + iC 

M'=-iB-iC 

. . 1 3 

and the length of each projected axis is -h" . 

To obtain the geometric form of the projection, give to all the variables 
the value zero, then to each one separately give all values up to 
unity. This gives four lines from O, identical with the projected 
axes. With three of these lines as adjacent edges form a 
parallelopiped, and form three more parallelopipeds with the three 
other possible groups of the four lines. The sum of these four 
solids, a rhombic dodekahedron, is the pi ejection required.
