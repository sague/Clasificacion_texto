PREFACE. 



THE following treatise is designed to present, as suc- 
cinctly as is consistent with a due presentation of the 
subject, the general theory of algebraical equations, while 
special attention is given to the analysis and solution of 
equations with numerical coefficients. 

The work may be regarded as a complement to the more 
advanced treatises on algebra, in which the general theory 
of equations, if discussed at all, is necessarily compressed 
into a space altogether inadequate to a satisfactory exposition 
of this important branch of mathematical study. In order 
to preseiwe this character of the work as a sequel to ordinary 
algebra, algebraical methods have been carefully adhered to 
throughout, except in a few articles, in which trigonometrical 
expressions have unavoidably been introduced. The treatise 
may therefore be easily read by those who have passed through 
the usual course in algebra. 

The work had its first inception in some vain attempts at 
so modifying Sturm's Method as to lessen the great labor 
attending an analysis by that method of most equations of 
above the fourth degree. Becoming convinced that, from the 
nature of the case, no such modification is possible that does 



iy PREFACE. 

not impair the certainty which constitutes the chief excellency 
of the method, the author turned his attention to an investi- 
gation of the possibility of a satisfactory analysis by means of 
Fourier's Theorem. This he soon saw could be effected if, 
by any means, the presence of imaginary roots in a given 
interval could be readily ascertained. The results of this 
investigation are given (Chap. X) in a method of analysis 
based upon Fourier's Theorem, a method that possesses the 
merit of at least great facility as compared with that of 
Sturm. 

The method involves, however, an extension of the applica- 
tion of Horner's Method, especially a generalization of the 
principle of trial divisors, not given in the great majority of 
treatises upon equations. This first suggested the idea of 
writing a short account of Homers Method in which its 
capabilities should be fully exhibited, with the method of 
analysis based on that method in conjunction with Fourier's 
Theorem. A natural extension of that idea led to the present 
treatise, the first upon this subject that, as far as the author 
has been able to ascertain, has been published in the United 
States. 

The treatise, though kept within its present dimensions by 
the exclusion of much that had been prepared, will be found 
to contain all the propositions generally given in an elemen- 
tary treatise upon this subject, with a few exceptions. Thus 
Newton's method of approximation, and that of Lagrange, 
have been excluded, as being entirely superseded by that of 
Horner, to which, even in the most favorable cases, they are 
inferior in symmetry, compactness, and facility. The theory 
of determinants has not been introduced, on the ground that 
a suitable account would require to itself a volume of the 
dimensions of the present treatise. The student desirous of 
information upon the foregoing and other omitted topics may 



PREFACE. V 

consult Todhunter's excellent treatise, the best, upon the 
whole, with which the author is acquainted. 

On account of the interest naturally attaching to the sub- 
ject, the algebraical solution of equations has (Chap. VII) 
been treated of at some length. In Art. 121, 133-146, are 
given some results that may be found of interest, and which, 
it is believed, are now published for the first time. 

A chapter (VIII) has been devoted to Sturm's Theorem, 
thus enabling the student to form for himself a clear estimate 
of the peculiar excellencies and disadvantages of the method 
of analysis based upon that theorem, and to institute a fair 
comparison between it and the method explained in Chap. X. 

A short chapter on cubic equations has been inserted, in 
which a method of procedure is given that relieves the solu- 
tion of the cubic from much of its tentative character, and 
reduces the arithmetical labor to a minimum. 

To render the treatise more convenient for the work of the 
class-room, the subject-matter has been thrown, as far as pos- 
sible, into the form of propositions with their dependent 
corollaries. The number of exercises given will, it is hoped, 
be found sufficient in number to illustrate every part of the 
subject and not so difficult as to needlessly consume time.

THEOEY AND SOLUTION 



OF 



ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS 



INTRODUCTION. 



1. Algebraical equations of the first and second degrees are 
generally fully treated of in elementary works on algebra; 
the student may therefore be supposed to have a knowledge 
of the subject so far, and to be acquainted with the meaning 
of the terms, equation, root, member, &c. The present treatise 
will be devoted to a discussion of the general theory of alge- 
braical equations, and the methods of solution for equations 
of the third and higher degrees, sometimes called the Higher 
Equations. 

We shall generally express an equation of the n th degree 
under the form, 



C n x n + CUz"- 1 + 



C 2 x 2 + C y x + C = 0, 



in which C r , the coefficient of the r th power of x, is a known 
quantity, positive, negative, or zero. The final term, C , which 
may be regarded as the coefficient of .t°, is frequently called 
the absolute or independent term. 

The equation is said to be complete when it contains all 
the powers of x from x n to x°, otherwise it is incomplete. 

When n, the exponent of the highest power of x, is a 
positive integer, the equation is said to be rational and inte- 
gral, that is, x does not occur with fractional or negative 
exponents. 



2 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Thus, 5s 6 + 17s 5 — 39s 3 + 106a; 2 — 53s — 17 = 
is a rational integral equation ; while 

X 5 _ 23^ + 5s 3 + 6s" 3 * _ 7 — 0, 
or s 5 — 2SV&+ 5# + 6^— 7=0, 

is an irrational equation ; and 

7s 4 — 3s* + 9s~ 2 + 13s- 4 + 8=0, 

is both irrational and fractional. 

Since irrational and fractional equations may always be 
reduced to a rational and integral form (see Art. 57), the 
equations treated of in this work will always be supposed to be 
rational and integral. 

By dividing both members of an equation by the coefficient 
of the highest power of s, we obtain it under the form, 

x n -f 6V1Z"- 1 +..... C 2 x 2 + C\x + C = 0, 

a form which will sometimes be found advantageous when 
enunciating some of the properties of equations. 

2. Any quantity, real or imaginary, which, when substi- 
tuted for x in the expression, 

C n x n 4- CUa*" 1 + . . . . C 2 x 2 + &x + C , 

causes the whole to become zero, is said to be a root of the 
equation, 

C n x n + C^s"" 1 + • • . • C 2 x 2 + C x x + C = 0. 

The solution of an equation consists in the determination 
of these roots. 

We know that for the quadratic equation, 

C 2 x 2 + C\x + C = 0, 

the roots are expressed by the formula, 

x = t.(-G± VW-WM). 

This formula contains the algebraical solution of the equa- 
tion of the second degree, in terms of the general symbols 
C 2 , Ciy C . The numerical solution of any given equation 
of that degree we may obtain by substituting in the formula 



INTRODUCTION. 3 

the known values of the coefficients. To obtain for the higher 
equations similar formulas, expressing the roots in terms of the 
eoefficients, was long considered the most important problem 
in algebra. But, as will hereafter be seen, no such formula 
has been found for equations beyond the fourth degree, and 
even those that have been obtained for the cubic and bi- 
quadratic are not always available for purposes of numerical 
computation. 

Yet, though the search for general formulas, to express the 
roots of equations of the fifth and higher degrees, has been 
entirely unsuccessful, we are in possession of methods by which 
we can obtain exactly, when commensurable, or approximate to 
when incommensurable, any root of a numerical equation, that 
is, of an equation having its coefficients known numbers. 
These methods depend on the general properties of equations, 
which we shall first demonstrate as a necessary preliminary to 
the study of methods of numerical solution. 

3. An algebraical expression involving x is often conven- 
iently referred to as a function of x, which may be defined as 
follows : 

A Function of x is an expression that depends for its 
value on x. 

Thus, x 2 , \/x, ax 2 + lx + c, 5x*— 1x + 32, are functions 
of x, since their values depend on that of x. 

The symbol for a function is one of the letters /, F, 0, &c.. 
prefixed to the symbol of the variable quantity. Thus, f(x), 
F(z), fi(x), (p(x), /(?/), f(z + y), &c, may be used to repre- 
sent any expression involving x or y, or both x and y, it 
being of course understood that, in the same investigation, 
a particular symbol, f(x) for example, shall always denote 
the same expression : thus, if 

f{x) = 5x* - 3Z 3 + 2z 2 + 1, then 

f(a) = 5a 4 - 3« 3 + 2« 2 + 1, 

/(0) =0 -0 +0 +1 = 1, 

/(I) = 5 - 3 +2 +1 = 5, 

/(-2) = 5 x (-2) 4 - 3 x (-2)3+ 2 x (-2)2+1 = 113, 
/(3) = 5 x 3 4 - 3 x 3 3 + 2 x S 2 + 1 = 343, 



4 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

that is, if/ (a) denote a certain expression involving x, then 
f(a), /(0), /(3), &c., denote the same expression, or its 
numerical value, when «, 0, 3, &c, are substituted for a. 

4. The symbols, f(x), fix), . . . / 4 (a), &c, are often em- 
ployed to denote functions derived from a primitive function, 
/(a), according to some given law : thus, if 

f(x) = CtX* + C^x 1 + C t x l + dx + (7 , then 

f(x) = 4<7 4 a 3 + W3X* + %O t x + C\, 

/ 2 (a) = 4-3 CW + 3-2-6' 3 x + 2C 2 , 

/ 3 (a) = 4-3-2-C 4 ^ + 3-2-(73, 

f,{x) = 4 32- C 4 . 

In this example the law of derivation is that each function, 
after the first, is derived from that preceding, by multiplying 
each term by the exponent of x in that term, and then dimin- 
ishing that exponent by unity. When derived functions are 
mentioned, it is generally functions derived from a primitive 
function, /(a), according to the foregoing law, that are meant. 
The function denoted by fi(x) is called the first derived func- 
tion of f(x); /2(a), again, which is the first derived function 
of f\(x), is the second derived function of f(x), and so on, 
f(x) denoting the r th derived function of /(a). When f(x) 
is of n dimensions, there may evidently be n derived functions. 
The n th derived function f„(x), though independent of x, may 
for convenience be included among the derived functions, as 
being -tlerived from f(x) by a repetition of the process by 
which the preceding functions were obtained. 

EXERCISES. 

Write out the derived functions of each of the following 
functions; and find the values of /(0), /(l), /(2), /(3). 

1. f(x) = x* + 7a 3 + 8a* — 10a — 13. 

2. f{x) = 3a? + 13a* - 8a 3 + 18. 

3. f(x) = a* — 13a 4 + 29a 3 - 52a* - 16. 

4. /(a) = a 8 — 8a 7 -f 7a 6 — 6a 5 — 5a 2 + 4. 

5. Find the r fh derived function of 

C n x» + CUa"" 1 + . . . . CW + C\x + C . 



FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 



CHAPTER I. 

FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS, INDEPENDENT OF 
THE PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY EQUATION HAS A ROOT. 

5. The most fundamental proposition respecting equations 
is that proved by Cauchy's Theorem, Chap. II, namely, that 
every equation has a root. Some important propositions may, 
however, be proved independently of that theorem ; and 
others, again, are necessary as an introduction to it. These 
form the subject of the present chapter. 

6. Prop. L— If f(x) = C n x n + CU^" 1 + . . . . C 2 x 2 
-\-C x x -f Co, he a rational integral function of x, then any 
term C r x r , that occurs, may le made to contain the sum of all 
the terms that follow it, as often as we please, by taking x 
large enough. 

Let k be the numerical value of the greatest coefficient that 
follows C r , the sum of all the terms, C' r _i x r ~ l -f CV_ 2 x r ~ 2 -f . . . . 
C x x + (7 , that follow C r x r , cannot be greater than 



k (x 1 - 1 + x r ~ 2 + . . . . x + 1) 

x— 1 
C r (x— l)x* C r (x-1) 



x r —l 

that is, than k ■ r . The quotient of G r x r by this is 



The numerator of this expression 
k(x'—l) k(l—x~ r ) l 

may be made as great as we please, and the denominator as 

near to k as we please, by taking x large enough. 

Cor. 1. — By putting x = - , tne function becomes 

y-»(C n + cLy + j.y . dtT 1 + C,y% 

in which any term nray, as above shown, be made to contain, 
as often as we please, the sum of all the terms that precede it, 
by taking y great enough, that is, by taking x small enough. 



ti 



G ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Cor. 2. — When x is large, the term in f(x) containing the 
highest power of x is the most important, and vice versa. 

Ex.— If /(*) = 3a* -7a* -5x* + Sx + 11, 
then /(10) = 3 x 10 4 - 7 x 10 3 - 5 x 10 2 + 8 x 10+ 11, 

in which the first term greatly exceeds the sum of all the 
remaining terms in value ; and in 

/(rV) = 3(A) 4 - ?(tV) 3 - 5(jV) 2 + 8( t V) + 11, 
the last term exceeds the sum of all the preceding terms. 

7. Prop. II. — To determine the form that f(x) assumes 
when x + y is put for x, that is, when x is increased or dimin- 
ished by any quantity y. Let 

/ (x) — C n x n + C n -i x n ~ l +..C 2 x 2 + d x+C ; then 
f(x + 7j) = C l Xx + 2jY+C^x + yy- l + ..C 2 (x + yy+C 1 (x + tj) + C . 

Expanding the different powers of x + y in this series, by 
means of the Binomial Theorem, and arranging the result 
according to ascending powers of y, we obtain,

FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 7 

Thus we see that the development of f{x + y) is a series 
of the form, 

P+ Q9 + b£ + *s£+ C„f, 

where P, Q, R, &c, represent the compound coefficients above, 
and are all functions of x. 

The first of the coefficients P, is evidently the original 
function f(x). The second coefficient Q, is derived from V 
by multiplying each term in P by the exponent of x in that 
term, and then diminishing the exponent by unity, that is 
(Art. 4), Q is the first derived function of /(#), which we 
denote by f(x). P, in like manner, is the second derived 
function f 2 (x), S is the third derived function f(x), and so on, 

u r 
f (x) being the coefficient of — . 

Employing this notation, we have, 

/(*+») =/(s)+/i(%+/ 2 (*)|+ ■ • :M*)& ■ • ■/.(*)£. 

where —f n (x) is evidently C n . 

\n 

By the student acquainted with the Differential Calculus, 
this expression for f(x + y) will be recognized as a particular 
application of Taylor's Theorem. 

8. Prop. III. — If in the function, 
f(x) = C n a? + CU^ 1 + • • • . C 2 a* + C\x + C , 

x vary continuously from a to b, then mil f(x) vary contin- 
uously from f(a) to f(b). 

For let c be any value given to x between a and I, then 
/(c) will be the corresponding value of f(x). Let c + h 
be another value of jc, then, Prop. II, 

f{e+h) = f( C ) + A(c)h +/■(«)£+ . . ./.-.(^ +/.(*)£"• 

Now, Prop. I, Cor. 1, by taking // small enough, the first 
term of the above series, after /(c), that does not vanish, may 



8 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

be made to contain the terms that follow it, as often as we 
please, and this term itself may be made as small as we please : 
that is, f(c-\-h) may be made to differ from /(c) by a quan- 
tity as small as we please. 

Hence, if in a function f(x), x be supposed to pass in suc- 
cession through all the values from a to b, the function will 
also pass through all the values from f(a) to f(b), seeing that 
whatever intermediate value f(c) it may have, we may find 
another as near to it as we please by making a suitable change 
in the value of x. For example, 

Let f(x) = x 5 — 18z 2 + 101s — 180, 
then /(l) = 1—18 +101 — 180 = -96, 

/(10) = 10 3 — 18 x 10 2 -f 101 x 10 — 180 = 30. 

Here we see that for x = 1, the value of the function is 
— 96 ; for x = 10, the value is 30. What the proposition 
asserts is that the function may be made to pass through all 
the values between — 96 and 30, by giving to x all the values 
between 1 and 10. It is not asserted that the function is al- 
ways increasing in this interval. In point of fact, this particu- 
lar function will, on trial, be found to be sometimes increasing, 
and sometimes decreasing, between the limits — 96 and 30. 

9. Prop. IV. — If in the equation, 

f(x) = C n n» + CUtf"" 1 + . . • . C 2 x 2 + C x x + C = 0, 

two numbers, separately substituted for x, give 'results with 
contrary signs, one root, at least, of the equation must lie 
between these numbers. 

Let a and b denote the numbers. Then, since, by suppo- 
sition, f(a) and f(b) have contrary signs, and, Prop. Ill, as x 
increases continuously from a to b,f(x) must pass continuously 
through all the values from f(a) to f(b), one of these values 
must be zero, as a series of finite quantities cannot pass from 
one sign to another, without passing through zero. 

10. In the example given in Art. 8, w T e found /(l) = —96, 
f(10) = 30. By the present theorem, there must be, there- 
fore, at least one root of the equation a? — 18a; 2 -f 101# — 180 



FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 9 

= 0, between 1 and 10 ; it may be readily ascertained thai 
there are three. Again, though for /(l) we obtain — 96, and 
for /(6), the value — G, we must not conclude that there is 
no root of the equation between 1 and 6 ; there are in fact 
two. 

11. Prop. V. — Every equation of an odd degree has, at 
least, one real root, of a sign contrary to that of the final 
term. 

In f(x) = C n x» + CUa"- 1 + . . . C 2 x 2 + C\x + C = 0, 
suppose n to be an odd number. 

When we put x = 0, the function reduces to the final 
term C Q , and has the sign of th^t term. By taking x large 
enough, we may, Prop. I, make the first term C n x n greater 
than the sum of all the remaining terms, and the function 
will have the same sign as x, which sign may be taken contrary 
to that of 6q . 

Since, then, /(0) has the sign of C Q , and f(a), by taking a 
large enough, and of sign contrary to that of C , has the con- 
trary sign, there must, Prop. IV, be a real root of f(x) = 
between 0, and a, that is, a root of sign contrary to that of the 
final term C . 

Ex. 1. 7x 5 + 23a 4 — 16z 2 + 8x + 19 = 0, 

must have, at least, one negative root. 

Ex. 2. x 1 + 17.T 4 — 105z 3 + 27z — 301 = 0, 
must have, at least, one positive root. 

12. Prop. VI. — Every equation of an even degree, having 
the final term negative, has, at least, two real roots, one of 
each 



Let the equation be, 

f(x) = C H z* + CU&* + • • • • 2 x 2 + dx + C = 0. 

When x = 0, the function is negative, by hypothesis, and 
when x is taken large enough, the function is positive, whether 
x is positive or negative, since x n is of even degree. The 
equation has, therefore, at least two roots, one between zero 



10 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

and some positive number, the other between zero and some 
negative number. 

Ex. 03* - 13a? + 23a* + ~'2x« — 19a? — 56 = 0.. 

must have, at least, two real roots, one positive, and one 
negative. 

13. If we could now prove that every equation of an even 
degree, with its final term positive, has a root, we should have 
established the general proposition that every equation has a 
root, the basis upon which the whole of the subsequent theory 
of equations may be established. To know, however, that 
every equation has not necessarily a real root, we do not 
require to go beyond the lowest of equations of an even 
degree, that is, quadratics, which may not have any real root 
when the final term is positive. The question, accordingly, 
narrows down to this. Have all equations of even degree, with 
the final term positive, roots, if not real, imaginary, similar to 
those obtained for equations of the second degree ? The 
investigation of this problem will be given in Chapter II. 
Before proceeding to that part of the subject, we shall prove a 
few propositions which are independent of the results of that 
chapter. 

14. Prop. VII. — If a function f(x), and the successive 
quotients arising from the division, be divided by x — a, the 

remainders, in succession, ivill be f(a), f(a), 775-/2 (#)» .... 

Let the function, which we shall suppose of the n th degree, 
be divided by x — a. As the divisor contains only the first 
power of x 9 we shall evidently arrive at a remainder independ- 
ent of x, and the quotient, like the dividend, can contain only 
positive integral powers of x. Denoting the quotient by Q, 
and the remainder by R, we have 

f(x) = {x-a)Q + R [1]. 

If Q, which is a function one degree lower than f(x), be in 



FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 11 

its turn divided by x — a, then, denoting the quotient by Q x , 
and the remainder by R v , we have 

Q = Q^x-a) + ft. [2]. 

Substituting this value of Q in [1], we obtain 

f{x) = Q,{x-af + ft(*-a) + i?. 

By continuing in this manner to divide each successive 
quotient by x — a, and substituting its equivalent for the 
symbol for that quotient in the preceding identity, we evi- 
dently, after n divisions, shall obtain as quotient the simple 
factor C n , the coefficient of the first term of f(x), and have 

f(x) = C n (x-a) n +R n - 1 (x-a) n - l + . .B 2 (x-a)* + R l (x-a) + R. 

In this result, putting y = x — a, w r e have 

/(a+y) = ay+*-ir" l + • • •B 2 f+E 1 y+E. [3] 

Now, by Art. 7, we have, writing the terms in reverse order, 

/(a+jr) = C'„y"+]^r 1 /»-.(«)r- 1 + . . .|-/ 2 («)2/ 2 +/.(% 

+/(«) w- 

As the coefficients of equal powers of y in these identities 
must be equal, we find 

*=/(«), ft=/i(«), A=j|-/i(fl)f-.-..«^i=]^|A-*W; 

that is, tf*0 successive remainders arising from the division 
ly x — a of f{x), and the successive quotients, will be, first, 
f:(a), the value of the function when a is put for x ; second, 
f(a), the value of the first derived function of fix), when 
a is put for x, and so on. 

15. Cor. 1. — A function, f(x), is exactly divisible by 
x — a, if a is a root of fix) = 0; for then f(a) = 0. 

16. Cor. 2. — Conversely, if f(x) is exactly divisible by 
x — a, then a is a root of the equation f(x) = 0; i. e., 

/w = o. 



12 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

17. In the next proposition will be given a convenient 
process for finding the successive quotients and remainders 
without actual division. Yet as this proposition is of con- 
siderable practical importance, being the basis of Horner's 
Method, the student would do well to work one or two exam- 
ples by dividing in the usual way, and compare the successive 
remainders with the results obtained by actual substitution in 
the primitive and derived functions. 

Thus suppose we take the function, 

f(x) — 3a 5 — 13a 4 — 21a 3 + 10a 2 + 91a + 425. 
then, f x {x) = 15a 4 — 52a 3 — 63a? + 20a + 91, 

i-/ 2 (a) = 30a 3 - 78a* - 63a + 10, 
12 

jg-/a(aO = 30a 2 — 52a - 21, 
ji-/ 4 (a) = 15a - 13, 

g/i(*) = 3. 

If now we divide f(x) by a — 3, we obtain as remainder 
— 103, which is the value of /(3), i. e., of the function when 
3 is put for a. If we divide the first quotient by a — 3, we 
obtain as remainder — 605, the value of /i(3), and so on with 
the other remainders.

3 is a root of a 3 — W — 32a + 132 = 0.

is divided by x — a. 

Supposing the division to be performed till we arrive at a 
remainder independent of a, and denoting the quotient by Q 
and the remainder by /?, we have

By Art. 14, we know that i? = f(a), that is, 

OX + GLicrH . . . -ftrf + ftfl + ft = 5. [2], 

Subtracting [2] from [1] , we have 
£,(#•— d*) + CU(af-*— a"" 1 ) + . . . . C' 2 (z 2 -« 2 ) + C^— a) 

The binomials x n —a'\ x n ~ l —a n ~ l , &c, are all divisible by 
ic — «, as proved in elementary algebra. Effecting the di- 
vision, we obtain, 

C n (x n - X + ax' 1 - 1 + ax n ~ 2 + . . . . a n ~ 2 x -f- a"" 1 ) 
+ C n _ x (x n -' 2 + oaf* + . . . . a"- 2 ) 

+ 

+ C 2 (aJH-fl) 
+ C\ = Q. 

Arranging this result according to powers of x, we have 

G n x n ~ l + ( C n a + CU) Z"" 2 + ( QL « 2 + CL, a + CU) af*

+ ((7 n «"- 1 +(7„_ 1 ^- 2 -f....(73« 2 +6 2 «+C / 1 ) = 0. 

Thus we find that, in the quotient of f(x) by x — a, the 
coefficient of the first term is C n9 and the remaining coefficients 
are formed in succession by multiplying each term in the 
preceding coefficient by a, and then adding in the correspond- 
ing coefficient of f(x). 

20. Upon examining the final coefficient of Q, namely, 

CnCT 1 + C n . x a n ' 2 + . . . . C z a 2 + C,a + C l9 

we see that by applying the process to this coefficient also, 
and adding in C , we obtain 

C lt a n + CUflT 1 + . • • . C,a? + C,d 2 + C\a + C , 

which, as before shown, is the remainder, f(a) . 



14 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

21. By this process the operation of division, so tedious by 
the usual method, is reduced to an operation both simple and 
compact. In practice we proceed as follows : We arrange the 
coefficients of the function to be divided in a horizontal row, 
supplying by zeros the coefficients of any terms that may be 
absent. Supposing x — a to be the divisor, we multiply the 
first coefficient of the function by «, and add in the second ; 
we multiply this result again by a, and add in the third 
coefficient, and so on till we have added in the last coefficient. 
The final result will be the remainder, which, as we have seen, 
is also the value of the function when x = a. The preceding 
results will be the coefficients of the quotient, in order, with 
their proper signs. The first coefficient of the function, which 
is also that of the quotient, we supply from the left hand of 
the upper row of coefficients. 

Ex. 1. — Required the quotient and remainder arising from 
the division of 

x i _ 5.^6 + 19^5 _ 32^4 _ 63a? + og^a + 73^ + 42 

by the binomial x — 3. 

We proceed as follows : 

1 _ 5 + 19 _ 32 — 63 + 98 + 73 + 42 \J>_ 
3 _ 6 + 30 + 21 — 126 — 84 — 33 
_ 2 + 13 + 7 — 42 - 28 — 11 + 9. 
Here the quotient is 

a« _ 2x5 + 13a 4 + 7^ _ 42^ — 28x — 11, 

and the remainder is 9, which is also the value of the given 
function when x = 3. 

Ex. 2. — Required the quotient and remainder arising from 
the division of the function

25 + 125 + 159 + 158 + 30 + 8 + 40 — jlTO 



FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 15 

Here the quotient is 

5a 7 + 25a 6 + 125a 5 + 159a* + 158a; 3 + 30a; 2 + 8x + 40, 
and the remainder is — 170. 

22. By applying the same process to the first quotient, we 
obtain a second quotient, and a second remainder, which, as 
shown in Art. 14, is the value of /^a) for x = a ; from the 
second quotient, in like manner, we obtain a third quotient 
and a third remainder, which is the value of %f>{x) for x = a. 
and so on. This will be more fully illustrated in Art. 69. 
As the process thus has its most useful application in finding 
the value of a given function for an assigned value of x, we 
shall give a few 

EXERCISES.

CHAPTEK II. 
IMAGINARY EXPRESSIONS — CAUCHY'S THEOREM. 

23. As before adverted to (13), we need not extend our 
inquiries beyond equations of the second degree to find that it 
cannot be said, generally, that every equation has a real root. 
We find, in fact, that when certain relations exist among the 
coefficients of a quadratic, we obtain as roots, not real quan- 
tities, but expressions of the form a -f bV— 1, in which b 
is not zero. Though these, when substituted for x in the 
given equation, cause it to vanish, and are thus roots by defi- 
nition (2), yet as they indicate operations to which no arith- 
metical meaning can be attached, they have received the name 
of imaginary, or, perhaps more appropriately, impossible roots. 

We propose in the present chapter to show that every equa- 
tion has a root of the form a + b V— 1, in which a and b 
are real quantities, positive, negative, or zero. When b is zero, 
the root is real, in all other cases imaginary. 

24. Since these imaginary expressions are of constant and 
unavoidable occurrence in the theory of equations, it may be 
found convenient to give a summary of the chief results arising 
from the conventions adopted in regard to them. 

The first convention is that we regard ± V— « 2 as equiva- 
lent to ± a a/— 1, since thus we introduce but one imaginary 
symbol into our investigations, namely V— 1. The whole 
expression a -+- bV — 1, consisting of a real part a, and 
another real part b affected by the sign of an impossible 
operation, we consider as imaginary on account of the presence 
of this latter part. We also regard such terms as b V— 1 as 
subject to the ordinary rules that govern algebraical trans- 
formations. 



IMAGINARY EXPRESSIONS. 17 

25, From these conventions Ave obtain the following 
results : 

I. The sum or difference of expressions of the form 
A + B V— 1, have the same form ; thus, 

(a ± bV^) ± {a 1 + &V=T) = 
(a±a!) ± (b ±6')V ir l, 

which is of the form A + BV— 1. 

II. The product of expressions of the form A + B V— 1 is 
of the same form ; thus, 

[a±bV~-L) x (a'±b'V^l) = (aa'-bb') ± (a'b + ab')\/~-L. 

III. The quotient of one expression of the form A + BV— 1> 
by another of that form, is still of the same form ; thus, 

a ±bV^l _ (a ±b V^l) (a' T ft'V^l) _ 
a ' ± j'v^TI " " {a' ± b'V^l) (a' =F bW^^l) ' 

{ad ± bV) ± (a'b - ab')V^l 
a'* + V* 

which is still of the given form. 

26. From the result obtained in II, we infer that any 
positive integral power of a + b V — 1 is of the same form ; 
and may thence infer that if a -f- I V— 1 be substituted for x 
in a rational integral function of x, whether the coefficients 
be all real, or any of them imaginary, we shall obtain an ex- 
pression of the form P -f Q*\/—l. 

2H, Two imaginary expressions a + bV — 1, and a— bV— 1» 
which differ only in the sign of the imaginary part, are said to 
be conjugate. 

Hence the sum and the product of two conjugate imaginary 
expressions are real. This we see exemplified in the imagi- 
nary roots, a + bV— 1, and a — bV— 1, of a quadratic, 
their sum 2a, with changed sign, being the coefficient of x, 
and their product, a 2 -f- J 2 , the final term. 



18 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

28. The positive value of the square root of this product, 
that is, Va 2 + b 2 , is called the modulus of each of the ex- 
pressions a + b V— 1, and a — b \ — 1. The modulus of a 
real quantity is, by the above definition, the positive value of 
the quantity itself. 

When, for any purpose, we desire to compare imaginary ex- 
pressions with each other or with real quantities in regard to 
magnitude, this can be done only by comparing the moduli 
of the expressions. 

29. In order that an imaginary expression be zero, it is 
necessar y an d sufficient that its modulus be zero : for in order 
that Va 2 + I 2 may be zero, we must have a = 0, and b = 0. 

30. The product of two quantities has for modulus the 
product of their moduli ; thus, 

(a + b V^l) (a + I V^l) = 
(act' - bb') + {aV + a'fyV^l, 
and the modulus of this is, 



V i {act — bb') 2 .+ (aV + a'b) 2 \ = vV + # 2 ) K 2 + ^' 2 ), 
which is the product of the moduli of the original expressions. 
In a similar manner it may be shown that the modulus of 
the quotient of two quantities, is the quotient of the modulus 
of the dividend by the modulus of the divisor. 

31. If we raise V — 1 to the second power, we obtain —1 : 
this multiplied by V— 1, gives the third power — V— 1 ; 
This again multiplied by V— 1? gives the fourth power 4- 1. 
Upon proceeding to higher powers, we obtain a recurrence 
of the preceding results, V— h — 1, — V— 1? + 1- Even- 
whole number must be of one of the four forms, 4r, 4r -f 1. 
4r + 2, 4r + 3, since, when divided by 4, it must leave as 
remainder, 0, 1, 2, or 3. "We have, therefore, all possible 
integral powers of V — 1 in the four forms, 

= 1, (V^i) ir+1 = V'-i, (V^i) 4+2 = -1, 



IMAGINARY EXPRESSIONS. 19 

32. In elementary algebra is given the formula for the 
square of an expression of the form a -j- b V — 1, 



\/a + bV-l = \i( Vtf + P + a) f*+ \ UVaZ + P-a) \$V-1. 

From this we may obtain the square roots of ± V— 1, by 
putting a — 0, b = ±1. Thus we obtain 

33. Before proceeding to the general proposition that 
every equation has a root, it will be found convenient to 
discuss certain equations of very simple form. 

Prop. I. — Each of the equations, 

x n — ±1, x n = ± a/^1, 

has a root, real or imaginary. 

I. x 11 — + 1. This equation evidently has a real root, 
whether n be an odd or an even number, since x = 1 satis- 
fies it in either case. 

II. x 11 = — 1. When n is an odd number, this equation 
is obviously satisfied by x = — 1. 

When n is an even number, it must be of the form 2m ; 
that is, we may put the equation under the form y 2m = — 1. 
Taking the square root of both members, we obtain 
if 1 = ± V— 1, an equation of the forms we are about to 
consider. 

III. x n = + V— 1. When n is an odd number, it must 
be of the form 4r + 1, or 4r -f- 3. In the first case, x = +V—1 
is a root, since (31), (+ V— 1) 4 ' +1 = + V— 1 ; in the 
second case, x = — V— 1 is a root, since (— V— l) 4r+3 

When n is an even number, it must be either some power 
of 2, or some power of 2 multiplied by an odd number. 
In the first case suppose n = 2" 1 , that is, put the equation 
under the form y°- m = + V— 1. We can now obtain a 



20 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

value of y by m successive extractions of the square root, 
which (32) will yield a result of the form a + b V — 1. In 
the second case suppose n = mp, where m is an odd number, 
and p some power of 2. By putting y = x p , the equation 
may be put under the form y m = -+- V— 1, a root of which, 
as shown above, must be y — ± V— 1, or #* = ± V— 1, 
the upper sign being taken when m is of the form 4r + 1, 
the lower when it is of the form 4-r + 3. We can now find, 
as above, a root of x* — ± V — 1, p being a power of 2. 

IV. x n = — V— 1. Proceeding as in III, we find, when 
n is odd, x = — V— 1? or + V— 1, according as n is of 
the form 4r + 1, or 4r + 3. When n is an even number, 
we may put it equal to mp, m being an odd number, and p 
some power of 2, and so find a root of the form a -f bV— 1. 

Thus, in every case, an equation of any of the given forms 
has a root coming under the general form a + b V— 1. 

34. Prop. II. — Every rational integral equation has a 
root of the general form a + b V— 1. 

Let /(a) == ftaf + CUaf" 1 + . . . . <7 2 z 2 + C x x + C , 

in which the coefficients C ;i , C n _i, C l9 C , maybe either 

real or imaginary. 

If, in this function, we substitute a + b V— 1 for jc, 
« and b being real, we shall obtain (26) a result of the form 
P + QV— 1, i 5 and § being real. Now, in order that 
a + b V— 1 may be a root of /(z) = 0, this result must be 
zero, that is, P and Q must be simultaneously zero, and there- 
fore the modulus \/P 2 + Q 2 also zero. It is required to show 
that some value of a + b V— 1 must exist, for which 
VP 2 + Q 2 becomes zero. For, if it could not become zero, 
there would be some value below which it could not be dimin- 
ished. But it will be proved that whatever value of */P 2 + Q 2 , 
different from zero, can be obtained, a value still smaller can 
be obtained by making a suitable change in the expression 
that is substituted for x in the function. VP 2 + Q 2 , there- 
fore, must be capable of becoming zero for some value of 



IMAGINARY EXPRESSIONS. 21 

a + b V— 1, that is, the function must become zero for some 
value of x. 

Let us suppose that for some assigned value of re, as 
x = a + bV— 1, we obtain 

/(*) = p+ ov^i. [i] 

in which P and § are not both zero. 

If we change a + bV— 1 to a + bV— 1 + &, that is, 
x to jc + 7j, we have, Art. 7, 

/(*+*) =/(i)+/i(*)*+/^)^|-+ • • • /.(*)*£■ m. 

In [1] we have, for z = « + b a/^1, f(x) = P + Q^~—L ; 
for this value of a; some of the derived functions /i(#), ./K^), 
&c., in [2] may possibly become zero, but they cannot all be- 
come zero, f n (x), at least, which (7) does not contain x, must 
remain. Suppose h m to be the lowest power of li whose co- 
efficient does not vanish in [2]. Having denoted the value 
of f(x) by P -f CV~1, so we may put P'-f #V— 1 for 
the value of f(x + h), and R + #a/— 1, in which P and $ 
are not both zero, for the value of that derived function which 
is the coefficient of h m . 

Substituting these values in [2], we have, 

F + Q'V-1 = {P+Q V~-l) + (R + S V-I) *» 

+ terms in A w+1 , h m+2 , &c. [3]. 

As we may assign any value we please to h, we may replace 
it by Jet, where Jc is a real positive quantity, and t is such 
that (33) t m may be + 1, or — 1, as we choose. Hence we 
can make F+ Q'V^l = (P+QV~^l ± (R + SV^l)*?" 
-f terms in higher powers of 7c. 

In such an equation the sum of the real terms in one mem- 
ber must be equal to the sum of the real terms in the other, 
and the imaginary terms in the one to the imaginary terms in 
the other : 

.% F — P ± RJc m + terms in h m+ \ Jc m+2 , &c. 
Q' — Q ± Sic" 1 + terms in Jc m+ \ Jc m+2 , &c. 

... p'2 + Q'2 _ (p 2 + Q2) ± 2 (PR + QS)^ + other 

terms in k m+1 , &c. [4]. 



22 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Now k may be taken so small that (Art. 6, Cor. I) the sum 
of all the terms after P 2 4 Q 2 will have the same sign as 
2 (PR + QS) k m , provided PR + QS be not zero. 

First, supposing PR 4 QS is not zero, then the sign of 
(P'2 + 0'2)_(p2 + 02) is the same as that of ± %(PR+QS)k m , 
when k is taken small enough, and this sign we can always 
make negative by taking t such that t m = — 1, when 
PR + QS is positive, and vice versa. We can thus always 
make P' 2 + Q' 2 less than P 2 + § 2 . 

If PR + ()# be zero, then we choose t so' as to make nega- 
tive the first term after 2(PR-\-QS)l m that does not vanish 
in [4], and as before we obtain (P' 2 + Q ' 2 ) — (P 2 + Q 2 ) = a 
negative quantity, that is, we have VP' 2 +Q' 2 < VP 2 +Q 2 . 



Thus, whatever be the value of the modulus yP 2 4 Q 2 , a 
modulus VP' 2 4- §' 2 of smaller value may be obtained by 
making a suitable change in the expression that is substituted 
for x in f(x) ; there must, therefore, be some expression which, 
substituted for x, will make the modulus zero. 

35. Prop . III. — The values of a and b in the expression 
a 4 bV—1, which, when put for x in f(x), causes it to 
vanish, are finite. 

We may write f(x) as follows : 

Substituting a + bV—l for x in the second member, it 
becomes, 



a 



(a + bV-iyh + Cn -\ + 



C n (a + bV-l) C n (a + bV-l) 2 

4.... a=,i. 

C n (a + bV-l) n ) 
Selecting any term from the series within the brackets, the 
third, for example, we have, 

0,-2 _. C n _ 2 (a-b\r^i) 2 

C„(a + bV~-^) 2 " C n (a 2 + b 2 ) 2 *?

IMAGINARY EXPRESSIONS. 23 

Iii this it is obvious that A and B dimmish without limit, 
as a and b increase without limit. Denoting the value of 
f(x), for x = a + b V^l, by P + Q V— 1 ; we have 

P+QV-^l = C n (a + b^-\y\l+A'+ BW~-i\> 

in which A' and i?' diminish without limit, as a and £ 
increase without limit. In the same way we have, for 
x = a — b\/— If 

p _ QV^l = C^a-bV^Y \ 1 + A'- B'V^l \ ; 

.-. p 2 + G 2 = c*(* + wy { (i + A'f + B'* \. 

This result increases without limit, when a and b increase 
without limit ; for then the factor (a 2 -f b 2 ) n increases without 
limit, and the factor \ (1 + vi') 2 + B' 2 \ tends towards unity, 
as A' and B' decrease without limit. Thus the modulus 
VP 2 -f- Q 2 , cannot become zero when a or b, or both of 
them, are indefinitely great. 

By the present proposition, therefore, in conjunction with 
that of Art. 34, w r e find that every rational integral equation, 
whether its coefficients be real or imaginary, has a root coming 
under the general form a -+- b V — 1, where a and b are finite 
quantities, either, or both, positive, negative, or zero. 

An irrational equation, as, for example, 

V% — 4 — Vx — 1 — 1 = 0, 

may be incapable of being satisfied by any quantity, real or 
imaginary, if we regard the signs of the roots indicated as 
being controlled by the plus and minus signs prefixed. The 
above equation, when rationalized and solved in the usual 
manner, gives x = 5, a value that docs not satisfy the pro- 
posed equation, but does satisfy the equation 

- y/x - 4 + Vx^l -1 = 0.

CHAPTEK III. 

GENERAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS, DEPENDENT ON THE 
PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY EQUATION HAS A ROOT. 

36. Prop. I. — Every equation has as many roots as it 
has dimensions, and no more. 

Let f(x) = C n a? + C n . x or 1 + . . . C 2 x 2 + d x + C = 0, [1] 

be an equation of the n th degree, it has n roots, and no more. 
By Art. 34, f(x) = has a root a i9 real or imaginary, and is 
therefore (15) divisible by x — a x . Hence we may put, 

f(x) = (x- ai )fa(x), [2] 

where 0, (x) is a rational integral function of the (n — l) th 
degree. If fa (x), again, be equated to zero, it must also have 
some root a 2 , and is, therefore, divisible by x — a 2 , so that we 
have fa (x) = x — x 2 ) fa(x), where fa (#) is a function of the 
(n — 2) th degree. Substituting this value of fa (x) in [2], we 
have, 

fix) = {x-a x ){x-a 2 )fa{x). [3]. 

In like manner, fa{x), equated to zero, has some root « 3 , 
and has, therefore, a binomial divisor (x — a 3 ), divided by 
which it will yield as quotient a function of the (n — 3) rd de- 
gree, which we may denote by fa (x) ; we have, therefore, 

f(x) = {x- ai )(x-a 2 )(;x-a,)fa{x). [4]. 

It is evident that a continuance of the process will lead 
at last to the simple factor C n , and that there must be n bi- 
nomial factors (x—ai), (x—a 2 ), . . . (x— a n ) ; therefore 

f(x) = C n {x—a l ){x^a. 2 ){x—a z ) . . . (x— a n ) — 0. 

Hence the equation f(x) = has n roots, since the func- 
tion vanishes when any one of the quantities a x , «2 , a z , . . . 
a n , is put for x. 



GENERAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 25 

Nor can the equation have more than n roots; for when we 
put for x a quantity b, which is not one of the quantities 
tf i , # 2 1 <hi • • • a n 9 we have 

fib) = C n (b-<h) (b-a 2 ) {b-a.) . . . (b-a n ), 

the second member of which cannot be zero, since none of th" 
factors is zero. 

37. Observe that it is not asserted that the n roots a l9 a 2 , 
a 3 , . . . a H , of an equation of the n th degree are necessarily 
different ; some, or all of them, may be equal. What the rea- 
soning shows is that the first member of an equation of the 
n th degree may be resolved into the product of n binomial 
factors, each of which, equated to zero, will furnish a root. 
It is found convenient to say that the equation has as many 
roots as dimensions, without regard to the relative magnitudes 
of the roots. 

38. Cor. 1. — From this proposition it is evident that, when 
a root ai of the equation f(x) = is known, we can obtain 
an equation containing all the remaining roots, by dividing 
f(x) by x — a l} and equating the quotient to zero, which 
latter equation is of one degree lower than f(x) = 0. When 
two roots, ai and a 2i are known, we can, by dividing f{x) 
successively by (x — a^) and (x — a 2 ), or at once by their product, 
obtain a function of x, two degrees lower than f(x), which 
quotient, equated to zero, will contain all the remaining roots ; 
and similarly for any number of roots. 

Ex. x s — 18a 2 + 101a; — 180 = has a root x = 4. 

Dividing by x — 4, we obtain x 2 — 14a; -f 45, which equated 
to zero gives two other roots, 5, and 9. 

39. Cor. 2. — If a rational integral function of x of the 
7b th degree can become zero for more than n values of x, then 
every coefficient in the function must be equal to zero, and 
the function must be zero for any value of x. 

For, otherwise, the function equated to zero would have 
more than n roots; which, by the present proposition, is 
2 



2b' ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

impossible, unless the coefficients be each equal to zero ; and 
if these coefficients be each zero, the function is evidently 
zero for every value of x. 

40. Cor. 3.— If f(x) be of the n th degree, it has 

n(n— l)...(n— r-f-1) e „ , , ,. , 

—5 '- 5 factors of the r th degree. 

\r 

For it has been shown that f(x) has n factors of the first 
degree. The product of every two of these simple factors is a 
factor of the second degree ; so there must be as many factors 
of the second degree as there are possible combinations of n 

things taken two at a time, that is, ^ , — - . In like manner, 

Lf 
with the n simple factors may be formed as many factors of 
r th degree as there are possible combinations of n things taken 

. , , . j., x , ., „n{n — l) (n — /- + 1) 

r at a time, that is, f(x) admits of — — rT -^ - 

factors of the r th degree. These factors, of any degree, will 
not, of course, be all different, unless the simple factors are all 
different. Thus the expression, 

.r 3 — 18a 3 + lOlz - 180 = (x - 0) (x - 5) (x - 4) 

may be regarded as the product of three binomial factors, or 
as the product of any one of these factors and a function of 
the second degree produced by the remaining two factors. 

41. By this proposition we find that every rational integral 
function of x may be regarded as the product of as many bi- 
nomial factors as it has dimensions. But to resolve a given 
function into its component factors, we require to know the 
roots of that function equated to zero, ?. e., the resolution of a 
function of n dimensions into factors, requires the solution of 
an equation of the n ih degree. The converse operation, how- 
ever, of composing a function from given simple elements, or 
constructing an equation that shall have for its roots given 
quantities, is very easily accomplished. The roots a u a 2 , (h> 
&c, being given, we form the binomial factors (x— -«i), (x— «_>)> 
(x— %), &c, the product of which, equated to zero, is the

equation required. It is required, for example, to form the 
equation the roots of which shall be, 7, 5, —3, 3-f-V— 2> 
3 _V^. 

The product of the binomial factors found from these is, 

(x—1) (x—5) (z+d) (x—S + V-^) (a— 3— V^i) 
Multiplying out, and equating the result to zero, we have, 
X 5 _ 15^4 + 64^8 + !2^2 _ 041^- + 1155 = 0, 
which is the required equation. 

EXERCISES. 

1. The roots of x* — x* — 35^ 2 + 129a; - 126 = 0, are 
3, 3, 2, —7; express the first member as the product of 
binomial factors. 

2. The roots of x 5 — 6x* — 37^ 3 + lOGz 2 + 456^ + 320 
= 0, are 8, 5, —4, —2, — 1 ; express the first member as 
the product of binomial factors. 

3. Form the equation whose roots are 7, 4, —11. 

4. Form the equation whose roots are 5, 4, 2, 1. 

5. Form the equation whose roots are 7, 3, — 4, — 10. 

6. Form the equation whose roots are 10, 8, 5, and 1± v-3. 

42. Prop. II. — An equation with real coefficients lias its 
imaginary roots, if any, in conjugate pairs. 

Let f(x) = C n x» + CU x»- 1 + . . . . C 2 x 2 + C x x + C = 0, 

where C n , C n . u . . .C , are all real, have a root a + b V— 1> 
then is a — b V— 1 also a root. 

Let a + b V— 1 be substituted for x in the equation, then 
(26) we obtain a result of the form P + QbV— 1, where 
P and Q contain only even powers of b V — 1- For, when 
an expression (a -j- bV— 1)" is expanded by the Binomial 
Theorem, the even powers of b V— 1 give rise to real quan- 
tities, so that only odd powers of b are affected by the symbol 
V— 1 ; and, as the coefficients of f(x) are snpposed_to be 
real, the symbol V— 1 cannot occur in f(a + bV— 1 ex- 



28 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

cept with odd powers of b. Therefore, if P + Qby/ — 1 
denote the value of f(x) for a -f a + b V— l,jwe_can obtain 
the value of the same function for x = a — bV— 1 by simply 
changing the sign of b in the former result. Thus if 

f(a + b V--I) = P + QbV^h then 

But if « + 5 V— 1 be a root of the equation f(x) = 0, 
we have 

P+ e&A/^l = 0, 

and as no part of P can be cancelled by Qb V— 1, this result 
requires that P = 0, and also Q = 0. Hence, also, 

P- QbV^l = 0, 
that is, a — b V— 1 is also a root of f(x) = 0. 

43. Cor. 1. — Every function of an even degree may be 
regarded as the product of real quadratic factors, whatever 
be the character of the roots. For if the function, equated to 
zero, have a root a -f b V — 1, b not being zero, it must also 
have its conjugate a — bV— 1 as a root. The function must 
therefore be divisible by (a — a + by/ —l) \x — a — bV— l) 
= a 2 — 2ax + a 2 + b 2 , a real quadratic factor. 

44. Cor. 2. — By a course of reasoning similar to that 
employed above, it may be shown that, if an equation have a 
root of the form a +Vb, it must also have a root a — y/b. 

EXERCISES. 

1. One root of a 4 — 27a 2 + 90a — 36 = is d + V^3;

45. Prop. III. — To determine the relations that exist 
between the coefficients and the roots of an equation. 

Let f(x) = x n + C„_! x n ~ l + C 2 a? + C v x + C r = 0. 

It has been proved that if « 1? a 2 , a& 9 . ,.a n9 be the roots 
of f(x) = 0, then 

/(z) = (z— ad {x—a 2 ) (x—a 3 ) .... (x—a n ). 

By actual multiplication we find 

(x— «i) (a; — « 2 ) = ^ 2 — («i + a 2 )a; + aiflfc, 
(a?— r/i) (x— a 2 ) (x— a 3 ) = a 3 — («!-{- « 2 + « 3 ) ^ 2 

+ (a l a 2 +a l a s + a 2 a^x — a v a 2 (h,

— {a i a 2 a$+ aia 2 a±+ aia2,a± + a 2 a$a4) x + a l a 2 a$a±. 

In these results we observe the following laws to hold : 

I. The number of terms in the product on the right hand 
is greater by one than the number of binomial factors. 

II. The exponent of x diminishes by unity in each term, 
from the first, where it is the same as the number of binomial 
factors, to the last, where it is zero. 

III. The coefficient of the first term is unity, that of the 
second term is the sum of the second letters in the binomial 
factors, that of the third term is the sum of the products of 
these letters taken two at a time, that of the fourth term is 
the sum of the products of these letters taken three at a time, 
and so on ; finally, the last term is the product of all these 
letters. 

We now proceed to prove that, if these laws hold good for 
(n — 1) factors, they must hold good for n factors, and thus 
universally. Let us suppose that 

(x— a^ (x—a 2 )...(x—a n -i) — x n ~ l + SiX n ~ 2 + S 2 x"- ? > + . . . S„.i

" ft " " " products of these letters 

two by two, 
" ft " " " do. do. three by three. 

" ft,_, a " " product of all the (n-1) letters. 

Multiplying both sides of this identity by another factor 
x — a n , the result will be, 

(x—ai) (x—a 2 ). . .(x—a n ) = x n + Si—a n )x n - 1 

+ (#2— /Sia B )af- 2 + • ./— #«-i«"- 

Here it is obvious that the first and second laws still hold. 
As regards the coefficients, that of the first term is still unity. 

that of the 2d term, Si—a n = — a lf —a 2 , —%,.... — a n 

= the sum of all the letters, — «, , 

—a 2 , — a n . 

" 3d « ft - ft a a = S 2 + a n (a, + (h + (h+ . • . + ««) 

= the sum of the products of all 

the letters two by two. 

" 4th " ft - ft «„ = ft - a n (a, a 2 + a > r/ 3 + . . . . ) 

= the sum of the products of all 

the letters three by three. 

" " wth " — ft_i a n = the product of all the letters. 

If, then, these laws hold good for (n — 1) factors, we see that 
they hold good for n factors. But we know that they hold 
good for four factors ; they must, therefore, hold for five factors, 
and so on for any number of factors. 

Therefore, a { , a 2 , a 5 , a a being the roots of 

f(x) = x n + C„_i X" 1 + C„_ 2 x n - 2 + . . . C x x+ G = 0, w^e have also 
f(x) = (x—cii) (x—a 2 ) (x—a s ) (x— a,) = 

= af + ft a"" 1 + ft.?"- 2 + . . . .S^x + S* = 0, 

and equating coefficients of like powers of x, we have 

C„„i = ft , C„_ 2 = ft , . . . . Ci = ft_i , C = ft , 

that is, the coefficient of the second term is equal to the sum 
of the roots with their signs changed, the coefficient of the third 



GENERAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 31 

term to the sum of the products of every two of the roots with 
their signs changed, and so on, the coefficient of the r ih term 
being equal to the sum of the products of every (r— 1) of the 
roots with their signs changed, the last term Icing the product 
of them all taken with changed signs. 

We may also enunciate these relations thus : 

— C',_! = sum of the roots ; C n . 2 — sum of the products of 
every two of the roots ; — £„_ 3 = sum of the products of 
every three of the roots; and generally ( — iyC n . r = sum of 
the products of every r of the roots. 

46. It is obvious that if the coefficient of the first term be 
other than unity, we must take the other coefficients divided 
by that leading coefficient when we wish to obtain the sum of 
the roots, &c. 

47. As these relations between the roots and coefficients 
furnish n independent equations involving the roots, it might 
naturally be supposed that by eliminating n — 1 of the roots 
we should obtain an equation from which to determine the 
remaining root. By performing the elimination, we do, in 
fact, obtain such an equation, but find that we have merely 
reproduced the original equation with another symbol for the 
unknown quantity. 

Let a, b, c, for example, denote the roots of the cubic 

x s + px 2 + qx -f- r \ = 0, 
then we have 

— p = a + b + c, q = ab + ac + be, —r = abc. 

To eliminate b and c between these equations, we multiply 
the first by a 2 , the second by a, and add in the third ; we thus 
obtain, 

a 3 + pa 2 -f- qa + r = 0. 

The necessity of this result is readily perceived when we 
consider, that of the three symbols a, b, c, any one, as a, repre- 
sents any one of the three roots without distinction, and the 
equation in a, which we obtain by eliminating b and c, must 
allow of three values for a, that is, must be a cubic. Yet, 



32 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

though these relations between the roots and coefficients do 
not enable ns to determine the roots, they do enable ns to 
discover many important properties of roots, as will be seen 
in subsequent chapters. 

48. The following proposition is independent of the prin- 
ciple that every equation has a root, yet it is most conven- 
iently inserted here, as a lemma to a useful corollary from the 
preceding proposition. 

Prop. IV. — An equation in wlricli the first coefficient is 
unity, and the remaining coefficients integers, cannot have a 
rational fractional root. 

Let x* + C' ( _i£" -1 + 2 ar + C\x + C — 

be such an equation ; and, if possible, let it have as a root the 

rational fraction y , a and b being prime to each other. By 

a 
substituting j for x, and multiplying throughout b n ~ l , we 

have, 
a n 
J 



+ C n .ia n - l +. . . + C 2 a 2 b n - Z + C x ab n - 2 + C Q b n ~ l = 0. 



a n 
If we transpose the first term — to the right hand, we have 

the remaining terms, which must form an integral expression, 
since a and b, and all the coefficients, are integers, equal to 

— -j-, which is not an integer. This is impossible, therefore , 

cannot be a root of the proposed equation. 

49. Such an equation may, however, have incommensurable 
real roots, or imaginary roots of the form a + b V — 1, in 
which a and b are incommensurable. For example, the equa- 
tion 

X* + 5^2 _ ioz _ 8 = 

has a root x = %. Dividing by x — 2, we obtain 

x* + <7x + 4 = 0, 

which has for roots x == — J (7 ± Vo3), which are fractional, 
but not rational. 



GENERAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 33 

50. Cor. — Since (45) the final term is the product of all 
the roots, it follows, by the present proposition, that in any 
equation having unity for its leading coefficient, and the re- 
maining coefficients integers, all the rational roots must be 
integral factors of the final term. Also, if this term, C , be 
a prime number, the equation cannot have rational roots, if 
± 1? or ± C , be not roots. 

The equation x 5 — 13a; 2 -f 9x — 11 = 0, for example, must 
(12) have, at least, one real root ; but since, upon trial, we 
find that neither ± 1? nor ± 11, is a root, we know that it has 
no rational root. 

51. Since, as will presently be shown, we can always trans- 
form an equation, having a leading coefficient other than 
unity, into one having unity for leading coefficient, processes, 
that will readily suggest themselves, have been deduced from 
the above property, by which we can, in any case, discover 
whether an equation has rational roots. Such roots, however, 
occur rarely in equations that actually present themselves for 
solution ; and, when they do occur, will necessarily be discov- 
ered in the course of the process of analysis hereafter to be 
explained. It is, therefore, not necessary to make a special 
search for rational roots. The following easy examples given 
by way of illustration, may be solved by the guidance of the 
property given in Art. 50, and by means of the process illus- 
trated in Art. 21. 

EXERCISES. 

Find the rational roots of the following equations : 

1. x 5 — Gx 2 + 10a? — 3 == 0. 

2. X s — Ylx — 40 = 0. 

3. tf - 4^ - 56a? + 217z + 28 = 0. 

4. x 4 — 2x* — 18z 2 + x + 70 = 0. 

5. x 5 — 37z 2 — 921a: — 918 = 0. 

52. Definitions. — A Variation is a change of sign in 
passing from one term to another ; a Permanence is the con- 
tinuation of the same sign in two consecutive terms. 



34 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Thus, in the function, 

5^7 _ 7^6 _ 135 + ^ _ 17^ + 3>r 2 + q x + 10; 

there are four variations and three permanences ; the sum of 
the number of variations, and of the number of permanences 
being equal to the number expressing the degree of the func- 
tion, as will evidently be the case in a, function of any degree. 
By changing x to — x, the function becomes 

_ 5*7 _ 7^6 + 13a* + x i + 17a* + 3x 2 - fa + 10, 

the variations being changed to permanences, and vice versa. 

53. Prop. V. — An equation, complete or incomplete, cannot 
have more positive roots than variations of sign, and a com- 
plete equation cannot have more negative roots than it has 
permanences of sign. 

Let the signs of the proposed function be, for example, 

+ -f — + + + +; 

we shall show that upon multiplying by a factor x — a. there 
will be in the result at least one more change of sign than in 
the original function. For, having to multiply by a binomial 
whose first sign is positive, and the second negative, we obtain, 
giving merely the signs that occur in the process, 

4- — — + — + + + — -7 + 
— + + — + — — — + + — 



+'— =F + — + ±±— ;=£-+ — 

writing the double sign in the result wherever the sign of 
any term is ambiguous. 

Upon comparing the series of signs in the result with the 
series in the original function, we find 

(1). For every group of permanences there is a correspond- 
ing group of ambiguities. 

(2). The signs before each ambiguity, or group of ambigui- 
ties, are contrary. 

(3). A final sign is superadded, which is necessarily contrary 
to the final sign of the original function. 



GENERAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 35 

Hence, taking the most unfavorable case, that in which all 
the ambiguities are of the same sign, we may by (2) take the 
upper signs without affecting the number of permanences ; 
then the signs of the result, leaving out the last, are the same 
as those of the original function, and (3) this last introduces 
an additional variation. Thus there is at least one more varia- 
tion than in the original. 

Supposing, therefore, the product of all the factors corres- 
ponding to the negative and imaginary roots of an equation to 
have been formed, each multiplication by a factor correspond- 
ing to a positive root will introduce at least one change of 
sign ; that is, an equation cannot have more positive roots 
than variations of sign. 

To prove the second part of the rule, we have merely to put 
— x for x in the proposed equation ; then, if the equation be 
complete, permanences are changed to variations, and vice versa. 
The transformed equation cannot have more positive roots 
than variations, that is, the proposed equation cannot have 
more negative roots than permanences. 

54. Cor. — Hence, when the roots of an equation are all 
real, the number of variations is exactly equal to the number 
of positive roots, and the number of permanences to the num- 
ber of negative roots. For if m and r be respectively the 
number of positive and negative roots, and m' and r' respect- 
ively the number of variations and permanences; then, since 
m + r = m' + r\ each being equal to the degree of the equa- 
tion, and m cannot exceed m', nor r, r', Ave must have 
m = m', and r = r'. 

55. This important theorem, generally called Descartes's 
Rule of Signs, from the name of its discoverer, is included as 
a particular case in Fourier's Theorem, (180), in connection 
with which some useful deductions will be given, which are 
usually deduced as corollaries from this proposition.

CHAPTEK IV. 

TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS. 

56. Without knowing the roots of an equation, it is in 
our power to derive from it various other equations the roots 
of which have given relations to those of the proposed equa- 
tion. These transformations are, some, useful in preparing 
the equation for solution by reducing it to a more convenient 
form, and some are necessary to the actual solution. The 
propositions of the present chapter comprise, by no means all, 
but the most useful and simple cases of the general problem, 
to transform an equation into another the roots of which shall 
be any given functions of those of the proposed equation. 

57. Prop. I. — To transform an equation having negative 
or fractional exponents into another having only positive inte- 
gral exponents. 

Let the proposed equation, 

f(x) = ax- 1 ' 1 + lx r + cx~ s + lex' 1 + 5 = 0, 

have negative exponents, integral or fractional. Suppose — s 
to be the numerically greatest negative exponent ; then, mul- 
tiplying throughout by x% we have 

f(x)x e = ax°~ m + bx r +'+ c + fcx *-*+&;• = 0, 

in which no negative exponents occur. It is obvious that the 
roots of f{x) = are not changed by this transformation, 
since, if f(x) =0 for a certain value of x, then also f(x)x* 
= for the same value, and vice versa. 
Again, to transform the equation, 

?/i p r t 

f(x) — ax" + lx* + cx~ s + kx*+l = 0, 

into another having only integral exponents, assume y' x = x, 



TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS. 37 

where \i = n qs . . . v, or the L. 0. M. of the denominators 
of the exponents. Substituting yv- for x in the proposed, 
we have 

f(y) = ay m ' + by?' + cff '+ .... +/ty r + J = 0, 
where m = — x ju, p' = - x ^, &c, are integers. 

The relation between the roots of f(y) = and f(x = 
is 2/ = V#, that is, any root of the transformed equation 
in y must be raised to the fi th power to be a root of the pro- 
posed equation. 

58. These results may be formulated in the following 

Rule. — To free an equation from negative exponents, mul- 
tiply out by the reciprocal of whatever power of x occurs with 
the numerically greatest negative exponent. To free an equa- 
tion from fractional exponents, substitute in the proposed 
equation y- for x, ivhere \i is the L. C. M. of the denominators 
of the exponents. 

Ex. I. — It is required to transform the equation, 
3aT* -f 17z* — 32ar-a + 9x — 8 = 0, 

into another having only positive integral exponents. 
Multiplying throughout by a 4 , we have 

Sxi + 17^ — 32 + 9x 5 — Sx* — ; 

from this, by substituting if for x, we obtain 

3if + 17?/ 28 — 32 + 90?/ 30 — Sty™ = 0, 
or, 9y*> + 17y® — 8y*-\- 3y 9 — 32 =0. 

EXERCISES. 

Transform the following equations into others having only 
positive integral exponents: 

1. x* + 3ar* + 5x~* -7 = 0. 

2. I + A_?_* 2== o. 

X 2 X 5 X 



38 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

3. 3x — hx% -f 7a ; * — lx-z = 0. 

4. 2xi + y& + 3^~ 3 = 0. 

5. *^I = 1 + **. 



G. yi + a 3 = 3a?— or 3 . 

7. vr^ = v 7 * — i. 

59. Prop. II. — Jb transform an equation into another, 
whose roots shall be those of the proposed equation, each mul- 
tiplied by a given quantity. 

Let f{x) = C n x n + C n _ x x n - l + C 2 x- + C\x + Q, = 

be an equation which we wish to transform into another, the 
roots of which shall be m times as great as those of f(x) = 0. 

11 . u 

Suppose y = mx, then — = x. Replacing x by — in the 

proposed equation, we have 

aJS)\ a.-, [^'\ . . . . + cM+ oi!) + c = o. 

\ml \mj \ml \mj 

Multiplying throughout by m n , we have 

/ (y) = C„ if + m C n . x y n ~ l + . . . + m n ~ 2 C 2 y 2 + ??z"- ] C\ y + m n C = 0, 

an equation whose roots are each m times as great as those 
of f(x) = 0. Hence we have the following rule, before 
applying which we complete the equation by supplying the 
place of absent terms by zero's. 

Rule. — To transform an equation f(x) = into another, 
fiyij) = 0, the roots of ivhich shall be m times as great, replace 
x by y, and multiply the coefficients, beginning with the second, 
by m, m 2 , m% .... m n . 

Ex. 1. — Transform re 4 — 19a? + 49a 2 + 293 — 17 — 
into an equation having its roots three times as great. 
Here m = 3 ; proceeding by the rule, we obtain 

f — bit/ + 441?/ 2 + 7SSy — 1377 = 0. 



TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS. 39 

Ex. 2. — Transform x 4 — 5L? 2 + l?6z — 789 = into 
an equation having its roots one-tenth as great. 
First, completing the equation, we have, 

x* + Oz 3 — 51a; 2 + 176a — 789 = ; 

then proceeding by the rule, and multiplying by powers of T V, 

we obtain 

y i _ .51^2 + >176y _ .0789 = 0. 

60. The chief use of this transformation is to enable us to 
have unity as leading coefficient without introducing fractional 
coefficients ; or, to clear the equation of fractional coefficients, 
without affecting the leading term with any coefficient other 
than unity. 

Ex. 1. — Thus, if we have the equation 

5^4 _ w + 11^2 + 5x _ 3 _ o, 

by taking m — 5, we have 

5^4 _ 7 x 5^3 + ii x 52^2 + 5x5 3 y-3x5 4 = 0, 
or, if — If -f 55# 2 + 125y — 375 = 0. 

Ex. 2. — If we have to clear of fractional coefficients 

* + 3 X * ~ 25* 2 + 60^ + 120 = °' 

we have to consider what m must be, so that its powers will 
contain the denominators of the fractional coefficients. 
By taking m = 30, and proceeding by the rule, we obtain 

f + \ (30) f - § (30)y + 1 (30ft + ^ (30)* = 0, 
or, # 4 + 40# s — 396 f + 3150?/ + 87750 = 0. 

EXERCISES. 

Transform the following equations into others having the 
leading coefficient unity, and the remaining coefficients 
integers : 

1. 5a; 3 — Sx 2 — \\x — 20 = 0. 

2. W — 54.T 2 + 30 = 0. 



40 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

3. s 8 - 23.54a; 2 + 36.7a; - .745 = 0. 

4. 3^ + ^-^+1 = 0. 

5. ^_l-z 2 - |a + 3 = 0. 

61. Prop. III. — To transform an equation into another, 
ivhose roots are those of the proposed equation, with the con- 
trary sign. 

Let f(x) = C n x n + C n . x x n - l + ....C 2 x 2 -j-C 1 x-\-C = 0. 

The transformation of this equation into another, having 
roots numerically the same, but with contrary sign, is merely 
a particular case of the preceding transformation. We replace 
x by y, and take m = — 1, that is, multiply the coefficients, 
beginning at the second, by the successive powers of — 1, 
which are alternately negative and positive ; thus we obtain 

O n fr - CUr*+ • • • • ± 2 f =F C L y ± C = 
as the required equation. 

Bule. — The signs of the alternate terms of a complete equa- 
tion being changed, the signs of all the roots will he changed. 

Ex. 1. — Let 

X 5 + na4 _ 23z 3 — 47a: 2 + S2x - 57 = ; 

then, replacing x by y, and changing the signs of alternate 
terms, we have 

y 5 _ nyi _ 23?/ 3 + 47# 2 + 32y + 57 = 0, 

an equation whose roots differ from those of the proposed only 
in having the contrary sign ; i. e., y = —x. 

63. When an equation is incomplete, we may omit to 
complete it by supplying zero coefficients, remembering, when 
replacing x by y, to change the signs of those terms contain- 
ing odd or even powers of x, according as the exponent in the 
first term is even or odd. Thus, 

Ex. 2. — Let f(x) = x* + 34a 3 - 96a; 2 + 5 = 0, then 
f{—x) = a; 6 - 34a- 3 - 96a? + 5 = 0. 



TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS. 41 

The equation whose roots differ from those of f(x) = in 
sign only, is often conveniently denoted, as above, by /(— x) 
= 0. 

63. This simple transformation is very useful, as we are 
thus enabled to confine our attention to the discovery of rules 
for the determination of positive roots, it being always in our 
power to change negative into positive roots. 

EXERCISES. 

Transform the following equations into others, whose roots 
are numerically the same, with contrary sign. 

1. a? — 17a: 2 — 53a: + 73 = 0. 

2. x* — 23a: 3 + 130a: 2 — 305a: + 96 = 0. 

3. x 5 + 37a^ — Ilia: 2 — 546 = 0. 

4. 6.T 5 — 41a? — 65a: 2 + 239a: + 426 = 0. 

5. 8a? + 57a: 3 — 172a: 2 — 306a: + 150 = 0. 

6. a* - 73a? — 54a: 4 + 29a: 2 — 13 = 0. 

Note this last example, and explain why in this case f(x) 
has the same signs as /(— x). 

64. Prop. IV. — To transform an equation into another, 
whose roots are the reciprocals of those of the proposed equa- 
tion. 

Let the proposed equation be 
f{x) = O n x n + CUar*+ ....C 2 x*+ dx + Co = 0. 

Assume y = -, and substitute - for x in f(x) ; then 
x y 

Multiply throughout by y n , and reverse the order of terms ; 
then 

Cor + Citr' 1 + c 2 r~ 2 + .... CUy + C n = 0, 

an equation in which, since y = -, the roots are the re- 

x 

ciprocals of those of the proposed equation. 



42 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Kule. — The coefficients of the equation of the reciprocals 
of the roots are those of the proposed, written in reverse order. 

Ex. 1. — Find the equation involving the reciprocals of the 

roots of 

5^4 _ 7a * + lla * + 23x -3 = 0. 

Proceeding by the rule, and replacing x by y, we have 

- 3y* + 2Sy* + llif - Ty + 5 = 0, 
or, 3if — 23y* — lly* + 7# — 5 = 0, 

which has for roots the reciprocals of the roots of the pro- 
posed. 

65, This transformation is chiefly of use in Lagrange's 
Method of Solution, and in Budan's Method of Analyzing- 
Equations, neither much used. 

EXERCISES. 

Find the equations having as roots the reciprocals of those 
of the following equations : 

1. 3z 3 — 5a; 2 + 20z — 11 = 0. 

2. W — 54z 2 — 12x — 15 = 0. 

3. x 5 — 1W + 32^ 2 + 7x — 23 = 0. 

66. Prop. V. — To transform an equation into another, 
the roots of tuhich shall oe the squares of the roots of the pro- 
posed equation. 

Let f{x) = C n x n + C n ^x n ~ l + .... C 2 x 2 +C x x+ C = ; 

the terms may be arranged in the following order, 

f(x) = (G n x n + C n _ 2 x-* + . . . . C 2 a? + C ) 

the terms containing even powers of x beiug collected, as 
here, with C n x n when ^ is even, otherwise the odd powers. 

Similarly, since in f(—x) the signs of the alternate terms 
are contrary to those of the corresponding terms in f(x), 
we have 



TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS. 43 

f(—x) = {C n x» + C H .»a?-*+ . . . C 2 x 2 + G )

- (C7 n -i af*+ CU^H- • • • C*x*+ G l xf= 0. 

Squaring the expressions within the brackets, collecting, and 
arranging according to powers of x, we have for f{x)f{—x) 

-(C ll J-2C H - 2 C n . i + &c.)x 2 »-«+ . . . ±(C l 2 -2C 2 C )x 2 

=f W = 0, 
the coefficient of (x r ) 2 being 

± (^_2(7,. 1 (7, +1 + 2a. 2 a- + 2-2CUa- + 3+ • • • ±»0W 0^), 

the upper sign being taken when 6> stands in an odd term, 
and vice versa, and O r+m denoting the nearer of the extreme 
coefficients G n or C Q . 

The equation thus obtained, by the product of f(x) and 
f(—x), and which we shall denote by F(x 2 ) = 0, has for 
roots the squares of the roots of f(x) = 0, since for every 
factor (x — a) in f(x), there is a corresponding factor (x-\-a) 
in f(—x), and therefore a factor (x 2 — a 2 ) in i^(^ 2 ) ; there 
are therefore n such factors, and the equation F(x 2 ) = has 
for roots, a 2 , a 2 , a 2 ,. . . .a n 2 , if a i} «2, a$,. . . . « n are the roots 
of/(aO=0. 

We obtain the coefficients of F(x 2 ) from those of f(x) 
as follows : 

Kule. — Given a coefficient G r of f(x) = 0, the correspond- 
ing coefficient of F(x 2 ) = may be found by talcing from the 
square of G r the double product of the immediately contiguous 
coefficients, adding to the result the double product of the co- 
efficients next removed on each side, and so on, as far as the 
coefficients extend ; to the final result we prefix a positive sign, 
if C r stands in an odd term, the negative sign, if it stands in 
an even term. 

Ex. — Given, a* — ox 3 + llz 2 + 7x — 6 = ; find the 
equation of the squares of the roots. 



44 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Here the expressions, which, with alternately positive and 
negative signs prefixed, will be the coefficients of F{x 2 ), are, 

1, (25 - 22), (121 + 70 — 12), (49 + 132), and 36 ; 
the required equation is, therefore, 

a* _ 3^6 + 179^4 _ 181a a _j_ 36 _ o. 

67. This transformation, as will be seen in Chap. X, is 
capable of being applied to good purpose in the analysis of 
equations. 

EXERCISES. 

Find the equations whose roots are the squares of the roots 
of the following equations : 

1. a* - 13z 3 + 12z 2 — 6x — 5 = 0. 

2. 5z 4 — IW — 23x + 19 = 0. 

3. x 5 — 27z 3 + 90a; 2 - 3Gx - 25 = 0. 

68. Prop. VI. — To transform an equation into another, 
the roots of which are those of the projjosed equation, each 
increased or diminished by a given quantity. 

Let f(x) = C n x n + ft-ia^M- • • • • C*& + C±x + fl = 0, 

be the given equation. Assume y = x — a, then whatever 
value is assigned to x, that of y is less or greater according as 
a is positive or negative. The required transformation is, 
therefore, f(a + y) — 0. By Art. 7 we have 

/(«+*) =/(«)+ fMy+\fMf+ • • -jizr/iWjr 4

or, writing according to descending powers of y, and putting 
C„ for ±-f„(a), 

f(a + y) = g.y+j^ ZI /.-.(%-'+ • • • +l/2(a)f+A(a)>J 

+/(«) = 0, 

an equation the roots of which are less than those of f(x) = 
by the quantity a, if a is positive, and vice versa. 



TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS. 45 

69. In Art. 21 was explained and illustrated a convenient 
method for obtaining the value of f{a). As intimated iu (22), 
we can, by continuing the process with the successive quo- 
tients, obtain in succession the values of f\{a), \f 2 (a)> ^fi(a), 
&c, which are the coefficients of the transformed equation. 

Ex. 1. — Transform the equation 

5Z 4 — IW + 29z 2 + 12z — 19G = 
into another whose roots are each less by 3. 

Writing down coefficients only, we proceed as follows : 

5 _ 17 + 29 + 12 — 196 |J^_ 
15 _ 6 + 69 + 243 



1st Quot. 5— 2 + 23 + 81; + f 47 = 1st Bern., or, /(3).

2d Quot. 5 + 13 + 62; +267 = 2d Kern., or, f x (3). 

15 + 84 
3d Quot. 5 + 28; +146 = 3d Kern., or, J/ 2 (3). 

15 

4th Quot. 5; 43 = 4th Kern., or, ]J-/s(3). 

Writing out the transformed equation with these remain- 
ders as coefficients, we have 

62/ + 43# 3 + 146^ 2 + 267?/ + 47 = 0. 

Since we have taken for a a positive quantity 3, the roots 
of this transformed equation are each less than those of the 
proposed equation by 3. For the sake of exhibiting the 
entire quotient, we have taken down the leading coefficient 
each time in the above example ; in practice the process is 
performed as in the following example : 

Ex. 2. — Transform the equation 

Sx 5 + 19£ 3 — 27a: 2 — 121a; + 20 = 

into another whose roots shall be each less by 2. 

Supplying the absent terms by zero, we proceed as fol- 
lows :

found that both the analysis and solution of equations may 
be completely effected by means of a series of these trans- 
formations.

71. Prop. VII. — 7*o transform an equation into another, 
in which any assigned term shall be absent. 

This is merely a particular case of the preceding trans- 
formation. 

If the roots of /(*) = be diminished by k, we have 

+..../(*)=«■ 

In order that the (r+l) ft term in this may be absent, we 
must take k so that the coefficient of y n ' r may be zero, 
i,e.,f n -r(Jc) =0. From (7) we find that f n -r{k) = (OJf 

+ l ^- 1 + $^)°^-* + & °-^r> S ° that k Wi " 
have to be determined by an equation of the r th degree. 

To take away the third term, r becomes 2, and we find k 
from the quadratic, 

G n W + - CU k + , % 1V CU = 0. 
w w(w— 1) 

To take away the second term, a transformation that is 
often found advantageous, we determine k from the simple equa- 

tion (Life + -CU = 0, whence we obtain k = — -~ . 

Ex. 1. — Transform ** — 15* 2 .+ 11* — 13 = 0, into an 
equation without the second term.

Here — ■£- = — , = 5, and we proceed thus :

Ex. 2. — Transform 5x 3 — lla? + S2x — 15 = 0, into an

In order to avoid fractional coefficients, we first by (59) 
transform the equation into another, the roots of which are 
15 times as great ; we thus obtain, 

y s _ 33^2 + 1 44 0y _ 1012 5 _ 0j 

and proceed as before, obtaining, 

* 3 + 10772 + 3053 = 0. 

72. To take away any coefficient except the second is not 
of any practical advantage ; it is besides evident that, in the 
great majority of cases, h would be incommensurable, when 
determined by equations of the second and higher degrees.

CHAPTER V. 

LIMITS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 

73. In the preceding chapter have been investigated 
methods by which an equation may be reduced to a form 
convenient for solution. We have next to ascertain, as closely 
as possible, between what limits in the numerical scale the real 
roots lie, so as to avoid unnecessary labor in the search for 
those roots. 

Definition. — A superior limit to the positive roots of an 
equation is any number that is nearer to + co than the 
greatest of these roots; an inferior limit, a number that is 
nearer to than the least positive root. 

A superior limit to the negative roots is any number nearer 
to than the numerically least of these roots; an inferior 
limit, any number that is nearer to — c© than the numerically 
greatest of these roots. 

A superior limit to the positive roots of f(x) = 0, might 
also be denned as being such a number that, when it, or any 
greater number, is substituted for x in f(x), the result is pos- 
itive : for if, for any substitution, we obtain a negative result, 
there must be a root greater than the number that produced 
that result. 

In the following propositions respecting the limits of the 
roots of an equation, it is to be understood that the coefficient 
of the first term is unity, unless the contrary is stated. 

74. Prop. I. — The greatest negative coefficient of an equa- 
tion, taken positively and increased by unity, is a superior 
limit to the positive roots. 

Let — h be the numerically greatest negative coefficient 
in f(x) = 0, which we shall suppose to be of the n th degree, 



50 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

then any value of x that makes x n — k (x n ~ l + x n ~ 2 -f- x-\-l) 

X " l 

positive, that is, x n > h , will, a fortiori, make f(x) 

positive. For, even supposing that all the coefficients after 

the first are negative, none of them is, by supposition, numer- 
al J 

ically greater than — k. Now the inequality x n > k 

is satisfied if x" = or > x n . -, that is, if x— 1 = or > k, 

X — J. 

or, x = or > k + 1. Hence f(x) is positive when x = h +1 
or any greater number, that is, k -\- 1 is a superior limit to the 
positive roots. 

Ex. 1. f(x) = x 4 — 15x* + 132 - 5 = 0. 

By the present proposition 15 is a superior limit to the 
positive roots. 

75. Prop. II. — In an equation of the n th degree, if — k 
be the numerically greatest coefficient, and x n ~ r the highest 
power of x that has a negative coefficient, then *\fk -f 1 is a 
superior limit to the positive roots. 

Let f(x) == be the proposed equation. Since all the 
terms that precede x n ~ r are, by supposition, positive, any value 
of x that makes x n > k (%*~ r + x"-" 1 + x + 1), that is, 

/v.n-r+1 1 

x n > k. — - — — will obviously make f(x) positive. The 

X x n ~ r+1 
preceding inequality is satisfied if x n > k . , or if 

X — JL i 

x r ~ x (x— 1) > k, or if (x—l) r = or > k, or if x = or > Jc~ r 
+ 1. Hence for x = <\/k +1, or any greater number, f(x) 
is positive, that is, \fk + 1 is a superior limit to the positive 
roots. 

Ex. — Taking the same equation we had above, 
o4 _ 16x 2 + i$ x _ 5 _. o, 

we have k = 15, and r = 4 — 2 = 2 ; therefore \/l5 +1, 
or 5, is a superior limit to the positive roots, a limit much 
closer than that obtained by the preceding method. 



LIMITS OF THE HOOTS OF EQUATIONS. 51 

76. Prop. III. — If each negative coefficient, taken posi- 
tively, be divided by the sum of all the positive coefficients that 
precede it, the greatest quotient thus obtained will, increased 
by unity, be a superior limit to the positive roots. 

Let the proposed equation be, 

f(x) = C n x n + C^x"- 1 + C.-.x"- 2 - CUz"- 3 + .- . .C r a? 

+ . . . . C = 0. 

To demonstrate the proposition, we arrange f(x) in a form 

deduced from the expression for the sum of a geometrical 

x m l 

series, — — — = x m ~ l -f- x m 2 -f . . . . x + 1, whence we have, 

X — J. 

x m = (x—1) (x m - 1 + x m ~ 2 + x + 1) 4- 1. 

We therefore transform all the positive terms of the equation 
by this formula, leaving the negative terms unchanged, thus : 

C n x- =C n (x-l)x*- l +C n (x-l)x n ' 2 +C n (x-l)x»-* + ...C n 
+ C n . 1 af l - 1 = C n . x (x-l)x»- 2 + C n _ l {x-l)x n -* + ...C n -x 

+ C n . 2 x n ~ 2 = C >t _ 2 (x-l)x»s + ...C n - 2 

-C n _ 3 x n - 3 = -CU ^" 3 

and so on, with the remaining terms. 

It is evident that in a given column only one negative 
coefficient can occur, since for different negative coefficients 
the powers of x are different. If in any vertical column there 
occur no negative coefficient, that column, of course, is posi- 
tive if x is not less than unity. In a column, in which, as in 
that containing x n ~ z above, a negative coefficient occurs, we 
must, in order to obtain a positive result, have 

and ( C n + C„_i + • • • • C-i) (x-l > Or , 

if the column containing x r has a negative coefficient C r ; 

that is, we must have x greater than n " — — ^ V 1, 

C 
and greater than-^ Ti — {- -~ V 1. 



52 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

If x, then, be taken greater than the greatest of these 
expressions, that value of x will make all the vertical columns 
positive, and consequently make f(x) positive. Hence the 
greatest of these expressions is a superior limit to the positive 
roots of f(x) = 0. 

This is generally the most effective of the three limits yet 
given, and does not require the leading coefficient to be unity. 

Ex. 1. x 5 + 13a 4 — 21z 3 — 69a? + 81a — 58 = 0. 

By (74) we have +70 as a superior limit. 

By (75) we have a/69 -f 1, or 10, as a superior limit. 

By the present proposition we take the greatest of the ex- 

21 , ., 69 58 

presses, rT3 3 + 1, j^ + 1, and , + 13 + gl + 1 1 

the second is plainly the greatest, therefore 6 is a superior 
limit. 

Ex. 2. 3x 5 — 17a: 4 + 56s 8 — 78z 2 + 9Sx — 105 = 0. 

By (74) we have 36 as a superior limit. 
By (75) we obtain the same limit. 

17 

By this proposition we have — + 1, or 7, as superior 

o 

limit. 

Ex. 3. x 5 + W — 156a 2 — 453z — 954 = 0. \ 

By (74) we have 955 as superior limit. 

By (75) we have a/954 -f 1, or 11, as superior limit. 

77. It is not generally of much importance to obtain an 
inferior limit to the positive roots. Such a limit may be found 
by transforming the equation into another, whose roots are the 
reciprocals of those of the proposed equation. The reciprocal 
of a superior limit to the roots of this transformed equation, 
will be an inferior limit to the positive roots of the proposed 
equation. 

Ex. 4. z 3 + 15z 2 _ 37z _ 45 = o. 
The equation of the reciprocals is, 

45#3 + 37?/ 2 _ i5y _ l = o. 



LIMITS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 53 

A superior limit to the positive roots of this is (76), 
15 97 82 

4.K , aw + 1> or oo ' tnere f° re Q7 i s an inferior limit to the 

positive roots of the proposed equation. 

78. To find limits to the negative roots, we change the 
alternate signs of the proposed equation (taking account of 
absent terms), thus obtaining the coefficients of the equation 
whose positive roots are numerically the same as the negative 
roots of the proposed equation. Superior and inferior limits 
to the positive roots of the transformed will, taken negatively, 
be inferior and superior limits to the negative, roots of the 
proposed equation. 

Ex. 5. 7^ — 13^ 2 + 38z — 43 = 0. 

Merely taking the coefficients with alternate sign changed, 
we have 7+0 — 13 — 38 — 43, from which we obtain 

— -f 1, or 8, as a superior limit. Hence — 8 is an inferior 

limit to the negative roots of the proposed. 

79. The limits obtained by the above methods are often 
far from close. Thus, in the preceding example, 8 was ob- 
tained as a superior limit to the positive roots of 

7^4 _ 13y 2 _ SSy _ 43 _ 0? 

while 3 is, in reality, a superior limit. Among other methods 
that have been proposed, that of Newton gives the closest 
limit. As this method is, however, virtually comprised in the 
method of analysis given in (187), we refer to that article. 

EXERCISES. 

By one of the preceding methods, find superior limits to the 
positive, and inferior limits to the negative roots of the follow- 
ing equations : 

1. x* + 15x L + 36x — 54 = 0. 

2. 5x i — 36a? + lSx — 91 = 0. 

3. 2x 5 — W + 9a 3 — llz 2 + 13x — 15 = 0. 

4. x« + 13.T 3 — 39z 2 — 54z + 105 = 0. 



54 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATION'S. 

80. Prop. IV. — If two numbers, successively substituted 
for the unknown quantity in an equation, give results ivith 
contrary signs, these numbers include between them an odd 
number of the roots of the equation; if the numbers give 
results tvith the same sign, they include either an even number 
of the roots, or no root. 

Let p and q be respectively superior and inferior limits 
to certain real roots a x , a 2 , a s , . . . . a m , of an equation 
f(x) = 0. 

f(x) = (x—a{) (x—a 2 ) (x—a B ) .... (x—a m ) <p(x), [1] 

where <f>(x) is a function formed from the product of quadratic 
factors corresponding to imaginary roots, and binomial factors 
containing roots that lie without the limits p and q, so that 
q>(x) cannot change sign for any value of x between p and q. 
If in [1] we put p and q successively for x, we have 

fiP) = (l>—<h) {p—<h) (p—a s ).. ..(p-a m )(f>(p), 
/(flO = (q-aj (q-a 2 ) (q-ao). . . .(q-a m )<t>(q). 

Since all the factors (p—a^, (p—a?), (p—a m ), are pos- 
itive, and all the factors (q—ai), (q—a 2 ), (q—a m ), negative, 

while (p(p) and <p(q) have the same sign, f(p) and f(q) will 
have the same, or contrary signs, according as the number of 

the roots a Y , a 2 , a s , a m , is even or odd. Hence, if p and 

q include between them an even number of roots, they pro- 
duce results with the same sign, if an odd number, results with 
contrary signs. 

Ex. / (x) = X s — 18z 2 + IOIjp — 180 = 0, 
/(0) = -180, 

/(6) = -6, 
/(10) = 30. 

As /(0) and /(6) have the same sign, we infer that there is 
either no root, or an even number of roots between and 6 ; 
there are really two. As f(6) and /(10) have contrary signs, 
we infer the presence of some odd number of roots between 
G and 10. 



LIMITS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 55 

81. It is obvious from this proposition that if we knew a 
quantity k smaller than the least difference between any two 
unequal roots, we could, by substituting in succession k, 2k, 3k, 
&c, for x, obtain as many changes of sign as there are unequal 
roots in the equation, and thus ascertain their number and 
situation. For when, in the course of our substitutions, we 
should pass the least root, a change of sign would apprise us 
of the fact, and so on till we had passed all the unequal roots. 
In order to find such a quantity, less than the least difference 
of the roots, Waring proposed to transform the equation into 
another whose roots should be the squares of the differences of 
the roots. Then, supposing we found / as an inferior limit to the 
positive roots of the transformed equation, VI would be a 
quantity less than the least difference of the roots of the pro- 
posed equation, and we could employ it as above suggested. 
This method of separating the roots is, no doubt, theoretically 
perfect, but the great labor of forming the Equation of the 
Differences for equations above the fourth degree, has caused 
the method to be entirely abandoned. 

82. Peop. V. — If the first derived function f(x), of an 
equation f{x) = 0, be equated to zero, a real root of f (x) = 
lies between every adjacent tivo real roots of f(x) = 0. 

Let « L , a 2 , a 3 , a, n , denote the real roots of / (x) = 0, 

arranged in descending order of magnitude, then 

f(x) = (x—a x ) (x—ov) (x—ck) .... (x-a m ) 0(jr) ? [1] 

where (x) is a function that cannot change sign, being the 
product of the quadratic factors corresponding to the imagi- 
nary roots, if any, of / (x) = 0. 

In [ 1 ] we put y + z for x ; then, as y + z — a 
— z + y — a, 

f(y + z) = (z±y-a l )(z + ^J(z + ^i 3 )...(z + ^ m )<f)(y+z). 

If now the first member of this identity be expanded by 
Art. 7, and the second member by Art. 45, in ascending 
powers of z, we have 



56 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

f(y) +/i (?)* + &c. = {S m +S m - 1 z+ . . .) (0(y) + 0i(3O*+ • •), 

where #„ = the product of all the terms y-a x , y-a 2 ,. ^y-a m • 
and S,,^ = the sum of the products of the same terms, taken 
m — 1 at a time. 

Equating the coefficients of z, we have 

My) = &-10W + &01&). 

Substituting for #„ and S m .i their values, and putting x for 
?/, as it is now immaterial what symbol we employ in this last 
result, we have 

M x ) = \( x —(h)(oc-a 3 )...(x—a m )^(x—a l )(x--a 3 )...(x--a m ) 
+ ... } (x) + (x—a l )(x—a 2 )(x—a 3 ) . . . (x—a m ) X (»). 

In this result we see : (1), Whichever of the quantities 
a x , «2 ? • • • «m ? we put for a, the coefficient of X (#) will 
vanish ; (2), in the coefficient of (x), when we put for x 
one of these quantities as a ri all the products will vanish 
except that in which the factor x — a r is not found ; (3), 
this product will determine the sign of f(a r ), as 0(#) is 
always positive. Thus 

f x (a x ) = (ffi — a 2 ) (fl] — flg) (dfi — a m ) («i), 

/l (flz) = («2 — «l) («2 — « 3 ) («2 — «m) («2>> 

/i (a 3 ) = («s — fli) (% — a 2 ) (a* — a m ) (a 3 ), 

/i («J = («»— «i) (am— «2) (««— 0m-i) (««)• 

These products are alternately positive and negative ; for 
the first contains no negative factor, the second contains one, 
(a 2 — flj), the third contains two, (a$ — a x ) and (% — a 2 ), the 
fourth contains three, and so on. Hence, by the preceding 
proposition, an odd number of the real roots of f x (x) = 
must lie between every adjacent two of those of f(x) = 0. 

83. In the preceding article it has been assumed that the 
roots 8 l3 #2, a z ....a m , are all unequal. The conclusions 
there arrived at hold, however small the differences between 



LIMITS OF THE ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 51 

certain of the roots may be. Equal roots may be regarded as 
roots with a difference infinitely small, and the proposition 
holds with regard to them also, as may be seen from the fol- 
lowing articles. 

84. Cor. 1. — If f{x) = have r roots, each equal to a x , 
then f (x) == has r — 1 roots, each equal to a x . 

For if / (x) = has two roots each equal to a x , then the 
factor x — a x must occur in each of the products that form 
the coefficient of (f>(x), and consequently fi(a { ) = 0. Thus, 
when f(x) has two factors x — ai,f (x) has one such factor. 
If f(x) has three factors x — a x , f (x) has two such factors ; 
for after dividing each of these functions by x — a\ , the quo- 
tient from f(x) will still have two factors x — a x , and there- 
fore the quotient from f (x) must have one such factor. 
Thus, generally, when fix) has r factors x — a x , f (x) has 
r — 1 such factors. That is, when f(x) = has r equal 
roots, fi (x) = has r — 1 equal roots, which we may con- 
ceive as lying one between each adjacent two of the r equal 
roots of f(x) = 0, being indeed an arithmetical mean be- 
tween these two. 

The same observations apply to any other groups of equal 
roots in f(x) = 0. Suppose that f(x) = has the root a 
repeated r times, the root b repeated s times, and the root c 
repeated t times, then f(x) and f (x) have (x— a) r ~\x— b) s - x 
(x—cY~ l as a common divisor. 

85. Cor. 2. — Only one root of the equation f(x) = can 
lie between any adjacent two of the roots of f(x) = 0. For, 
if there could be two, there would be at least one root of 
f (x) = lying between them, so that the roots of f (x) = 0, 
supposed to be adjacent, would not be adjacent. 

86. Cor. 3,— If f(x) = has m real roots, then f(x) = 
must have at least m — 1 real roots in order to have one lying 
between each adjacent two of those of f(x) = 0. Hence, if 
an equation have all its roots real, the derived equation will 
also have all its roots real, each lying singly between a pair 



58 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

of those of the proposed equation ; the derived equation 
f (x) = is in this case properly called the limiting equation 
of f{x) =0. 

87. Since f 2 (%) is, Art. 4, the first derived function of 
f\ (z)s f-2 ( X ) = will have an odd number of its roots 
lying between each adjacent pan of the real roots of f(x) = 0. 
If, then, / (x) = has m real roots, f (x) = has at least 
m — 1 real roots, and f 2 (x) = has at least m — 2 real 
roots. Proceeding in this way, we arrive at the general state- 
ment that, if f(x) = has m real roots, f r (x) = has 
at least m — r real roots. 

88. Cor. 4. — If / (x) = 0, being of the n th degree, has 
p imaginary roots, it has n — p real roots ; and since, by 
the preceding article, f (:r) =0 has at least n — p — r 
real roots, it can, being of the (n — r) th degree, have only p 
imaginary roots at most. Hence, if any of its derived equa- 
tions have p imaginary roots, f(x) = must have at least 
as many. 

89. Cor. 5. — If we know all the real roots of f (x) = 0, 
we can, by means of them, ascertain how many real roots 
f(x) = contains. 

Let a, (3, y, . . . . k be the real roots of f (x) = 0, ar- 
ranged in descending order of magnitude. We substitute 
these quantities, in order, for x in f{x), and note the signs 
of the results, /(a), /(0), /(y), /(«). 

Then, according as / (a) is negative or positive, the pro- 
posed equation has, or has not, a root greater than a. The 
equation has, or has not, a root between a and (3, according 
as f(a) and /(|3) differ or agree in sign, and so on. Finally, 
if /(«;) be positive for an equation of odd degree, or nega- 
tive for one of even degree, there is a root of f (x) = 
less than k, otherwise not. The number of the real roots 
of f(x) = is accordingly equal to the number of changes 
of sign in the series of results produced by the substitu- 
tions, in order, of -f- en, a, B, y, ....«,— cc for x in 
f(x) =0.

00. This property of the roots of derived equations is 
the basis of a method suggested by Rolle for separating the 
real roots of an equation. He proposed, by means of the 
derived equation of the second degree, to find limits to 
the roots of the preceding derived equation of the third de- 
gree ; thence limits to the roots of the antecedent derived 
equation of the fourth degree, and so on till limits were 
obtained to the roots of the proposed equation. This, called 
the Method of Cascades, has, like that of Waring, been 
entirely abandoned on account of the length of the calcu- 
lations required. 

Note. — An equation of the third degree can, of course, be easily ana- 
lyzed in this manner, since its first derived function is of the second degree. 
It appears, however, to have been hitherto overlooked that an equation of 
the fourth degree can also be analyzed by the aid of a quadratic, or that, 
generally, any equation in which the second term from beginning or end is 
absent (a condition that can always be fulfilled by Art. 71), can be analyzed 
by the aid of an equation lower by two degrees. Let the equation be, 
C n x n + + GVstf' 1 - 2 + . . . . C- 2 x* + &x + 0. = 0. [1]. 

Forming (64) the equation of the reciprocals of this, and equating its 
first derived function to zero, we have 

nCoy~ l + {n-l)GitT^ + ..,.. 3<7„_ 3 2/ 2 + 2C„_ 22 / = 0. [2]. 
An odd number of the roots of [2] lies between every adjacent two of 
the reciprocals of the real roots of [1] ; therefore, taking the equation 

2C n _ 2 z»- 1 + 3&-3S*- 2 + . . . . (/z-l)Ciz 2 + jiCoZ = 0, [3] 
whose roots are the reciprocals of those of [2], we have an equation whose 
roots separate those of [1]. One root of [3j is z = ; the remaining roots 
can be determined by an equation of the degree n — 2. If we suppose 
[1] to be of the fifth degree, its roots can be separated by those of the 
cubic 2C 3 s 3 + 3C 2 s 2 4- 4G'i z + 5Co = 0, and another root 2 = 0. If the 
equation be of the fourth degree, its roots will be separated by those of 
the quadratic 2C 2 z 2 + W\Z + 4 Co = 0, which are given in the formula 
e _ -sd± VW-zw,c ^ and another root g _ 

Ex. 1. The equation a 4 — 12a? + 12a— 3 = has for roots x = -3.9. ., 
x = .44. ., .60. ., 2.8. . ; by the above formula we obtain z = 0, .5, 1, 
which separate the values of x. 

Ex. 2. The equation a 4 - 467a; 2 + 3660a; +*2826 = has for roots 
x = 12.70828. ., 12.70820. ., -.70. ., -24.7. . ; by the aid of the formula 
we obtain z = 12.70824. ., 0, — .95. ., which separate the roots of the 
equation, two of which concur to six figures. We thus see that equa- 
tions of less than the fifth degree can be easily analyzed by means of 
limiting equations. 

Though an equation of the third degree in its most general form may 
be analyzed by means of a quadratic, it may be of use to note that when 
in the form C? x z + C\ x + Co — 0, its two smaller roots, which are of the 

same sign as Co, can be separated by 3 Co -. 2Ci, if they are real. For 

example, the equation x s — 7x + 7 = has one root greater than ~ = 1.5, 

and one less. For exercises the student is referred to the numerous ex- 
amples given on pages 125 and 153.

CHAPTEE VI. 

ON THE DEPRESSION OF EQUATIONS. 

91. In the present chapter we shall treat of those equations 
which, on account of certain relations existiDg among the 
roots, are capable of depression, that is, of being resolved into 
equations of lower degrees. 

Among the most important of these, are those equations 
which contain equal roots. We propose to show how these 
equal roots may be eliminated, and the solution of the equa- 
tion containing them reduced to that of equations of lower 
degrees having only unequal roots. 

92. Prop. I. — An equation f(x) = has, or has not, 
equal roots according as f ' (x) and f\(x) have, or have not, 
a common factor involving x. 

As far as regards real roots, this has been shown in Art. 84, 
and that result may be made to include imaginary roots by a 
slight modification of the demonstration. 

Thus, let «! , a 2 , (t 3 , . . . . a n include all the roots of 
/ (x) = 0, real or imaginary ; then 

f(x) = ( x —a l )(x—a 2 )(x—a^ .... (x— a,), [1]. 

f x (x) = \(x—a 2 )(x—a< i )...(x—a ll ) + (x—a l )(x—a; i )...(x—a ) ) 

+ &c \ [2]. 

It is evident that f(x) and f x {x) have no common factor 
if all the factors in f (x) are different; for then all the 
products in [2] are different, each being equal to f{x) divided 
by a factor (x— a v ), (x—a?), &c, different in each case ; or, 

m = m + m' + m + ....m. . 

1 w x— a { x—a 1 x—a 3 x—a n 



DEPRESSION" OF EQUATIONS. 61 

If in [1] we suppose r of the roots to be each equal to a, 
s of them equal to b, and t of them equal to c, then 

f x (x) = \{x-ay-\x-by(x-cy . ..( X -a n ) + {x-ay{x-l)-' 

(x—c) 1 . . . (x—a n ) -j- {x—a) r (x—b) 8 {x—c) t ~ i . . . (x—a >t ) 
+ products each containing (x— a)'(x— by(x— c) 1 }. 

Thus (x — a)'~ 1 (x—by~ 1 (x — c) <_1 occurs as a factor in every 
term of f x (x), and is therefore a common factor of / (x) 
and /i (x). 

93. In order, therefore, to determine whether an equation 
f{x) = has equal roots, Ave have only to ascertain whether 
f(x) and fi (x) have a A common divisor </> (a). If such a com- 
mon measure be found, then the quotient of f(x) by <j> (x) 
will, equated to zero, contain all the roots of the proposed, 
without repetition. If (x) is of the form (x— a) r , it will be 
found advantageous to divide by (x— a) r+ \ so as to obtain the 
quotient of as low degree as possible. 

Ex. 1. Given f(x) = a 4 — a 3 — 30a; 2 + 32a; + 160 = ; 
required to determine whether the equation has equal roots. 

Here f Y (x) = 4a 3 — 3a 2 — 60a + 32, and we find a com- 
mon measure (x— 4) ; /(a), therefore, has a factor (a— 4) 2 , 
dividing by which, we find 

f(x) = (£-4)2 (z 2 + 7a+10) = 0. 

Thus the' roots of the equation are, —5, —2, 4, 4. 

Ex. 2. Given f(x) = 4a 5 + 17a 4 + 8a 3 — 40a; 2 — 32a + 16 
= ; determine whether the equation has equal roots. 

Here f x (x) = 20a* + 68a 3 + 24a 2 _ 80a — 32, and we 
find a common measure a 2 + 4a -f- 4 ; / (a) has, therefore, 
a factor (a + 2) 3 . Dividing by this, we find 

f{x) = (a + 2) 3 (4a 2 - 7a + 2) = 0. 

Thus the roots of the equation are, — 2, — 2, — 2, and 

i(7±VT7). 

94. The common measure of /(a) and f Y (x) may, how- 
ever, be itself an expression containing more than one set of 



62 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

repeated factors. We require, therefore, to deduce a systematic 
process for obtaining separate equations that contain only one 
set of factors. 

Let Xi be the product of all the factors that occur but 
once in f(x) ; X 2 , the product of the factors that occur 
twice ; X 3 , the product of those that occur three times ; 
and so on, any of these factors, as X m , being unity if there 
is no set of factors repeated m times. Thus f(x) = X t 
X 2 * Xi X 4 *....X/. 

Denoting the G. C. M. of f(x) and f 1 (x) by (b { (x), we 
have, 

^(x) = XtX£X} : :..xr\ 

and denoting the G. C. M. of </>! (x) and its derived function 
(pi'(x) by 02 (x), we have, 

2 (x) = X z X? X;- 1 . 

In like manner we obtain in succession, 

03 (x) = X 4 X 5 2 X/- 3 , 

4 (x) = x a . . . . x;-\ 

0,-1 (x) = X r . 

0,. (x) = 1, since X r has only unequal factors. 

From these functions we obtain by division, 

* M = $|=*M.."*, 
Fr (x) =*£&= x r . 

<p,.(x) 

We can now obtain the separate factors X t , X 2 , X,_] , 

by another division ; thus, 

Fl (*') _ Y . F 2 (x) _ Fr-Ax) _ v 

W(xj - Al ' TO ~ Xi ' ~fM ~ X - 1 - 



DEPRESSION OF EQUATIONS. 

Finally, by equating the functions A\ . X : X . to zero. 

we obtain the roots of the proposed equation : any root that 
occurs in X m , for example, occurring m times in f(x) = 0. 
The process may be presented as follows : 

/ (x), o^x), <fo(x), .... </>,_! ( X ), 
F x {x), Fax), F 3 {x), . . . . F r (x), 
Ji\ , A 2 , X 3 , . . . . A r , 

In the first line, each term, after the first, is the G. C. M. 
of the preceding term and its first derived function. In the 
second line, each term is the quotient of the term under 
which it stands, by the next term in the same line. In the 
third line, each term is the quotient of the term under which 
it stands by the next term in the second line. 

The following example will illustrate the process. 

/ (x) = X s — ~x 7 — 2z* + IIS.? 5 — 2o9x* - 83a 3 + 613a 8 

- lOSz - 432 = 0. 
<h (x) = x* — W + 13a* + ox — 18. 

2 ( x ) — x — 3. 

03 (X) = 1. 

F x (x) = x* — ld.r 3 -f 102- + 'U. 

• F 2 (x) = x 5 — 4a* + x -f- 6. 

F ; ,{x) = x-3. 

X, =x + ±. 

X, = x 2 — x — 2. 

X Z = x - 3. 

.-. / (x) = (s+4) (x^-x-2Y(x-S)K 

95. Cor.— When the coefficients of f(x) are all commen- 
surable, the functions Xi , X 2 , X t . have likewise all their 

coefficients commensurable. Hence 

(1). If only one of the roots of f(x) = is repeated r 
times, that root must be commensurable ; for it will be de- 
termined by an equation X r = 0, which will be of the first 
degree, and contains no incommensurable quanti 

(2). Hence incommensurable equal roots will be deter- 
mined by equations of at least the second degree : and any 
equation that contains such roots must have a factor X . 



<J4 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

where m cannot be less than two; that is, the equation must, 
at least, have a factor X? of the fourth degree. Hence 

(3). An equation of the third degree with commensurable 
coefficients cannot have equal roots that are not commen- 
surable ; and 

(4). An equation of the fourth degree with commensurable 
coefficients cannot have incommensurable equal roots, unless 
its first member is a perfect square ; 

(5). An equation of the fifth degree cannot have incommen- 
surable equal roots, unless it has one commensurable root. 

(6). Equations of the sixth and higher degrees may have 
such roots, even when their coefficients are all commensurable. 

96. We are thus in possession of a method by which we 
can eliminate all equal roots from an equation, and obtain 
other equations of inferior degrees involving roots without 
any repetition. The process, however, though simple in 
theory, involves much numerical labor in equations of high 
degree, with large coefficients, as will be fully appreciated 
when we come to exemplify Sturm's Method, which consists 
essentially in an operation similar to that of finding the 
G. 0. M. of a proposed function, and its first derived function. 

EXERCISES. 

Find the equal roots in the following equations : 

1. ^3 _ X 2 _ $ x -f. 12 =r 0. 

2. 4i 3 + 12x 2 — 63# + 54 = 0. 

3. as* — W +220a; + 75 = 0. 

4. 8x i — 52£ 3 + G6x 2 + llx — 49 = 0. 

5. x 5 + x i — l&c 3 + 14a: 2 + 21x + 5 = 0. 

6. x 6 - 13z 4 + 12^ 3 + 9W + QGx + 12 = 0. 

RECIPROCAL EQUATIONS. 

97. In Art. 64 we found that an equation 

x n 4 C n . x x n - 1 + <7, ( _ 2 £"- 2 -}- C.x' 1 4- dx 4- C = 

may be transformed into an equation whose roots are the 



DEPRESSION OF EQUATIONS. G5 

reciprocals of those of the proposed, by simply writing the 
coefficients in reverse order, and replacing x by some other 
symbol. If the resulting transformed equation be identical 
with the proposed equation, it is obvious that for every value a 

that satisfies either equation, there must be another value - 

that also satisfies it. Such equations are called reciprocal 
equations, and it will be shown that they can be depressed to 
equations of one-half their own degree. 

98. To find what relations must exist among the coeffi- 
cients in order that a proposed equation may be a reciprocal 
equation, suppose the equation above to be transformed by the 
rule in (64), and divide through by C ; thus we obtain 

r + gy- 1 + §V- 2 + . . . .%v + %* + 1 = o. 

Iii order that the transformed may be identical with the 
proposed equation we must have 

C 

77 — k/i-i > or Ci = C o^n-i j ^2 — G G„_2 ; . . . C r = Co6„_ r ; 1 = G ~. 

From the last equation we obtain C = +1, or C = —1, 
and this gives rise to two classes of reciprocal equations. 

First. If C = +1, we have 

d = C n _, ; C 2 = C n _ 2 ; . . . . C r = C /( _, ; . . . . &c. 

Therefore «w equation is a reciprocal equation when co- 
efficients equidistant from the first and last are equal. 

Secondly. If C = —1, we have 

L>\ = — 6„_! ; 6 2 = — C n _2 ; . . . . C r = — G„_,. ; &c. 

In this case, supposing n = 2m, we should have the middle 
term C m = — C m , which is impossible unless C m = 0. 

Therefore an equation is a reciprocal equation when co- 
efficients equidistant from the first and last are numerically 



G6 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

equal though of contrary signs, provided that the middle co- 
efficient he zero, if the equation be of even degree. 

Ex. 1. x G — Hx 5 -f 45s 4 + 12z 3 + 45z 2 — lx + 1 = 0, is 
a reciprocal equation of the first class. 

Ex. 2. x 8 + llz 7 — 5^ — Six 5 + Six? + 5x 2 -lk-l = 0, 
is a reciprocal equation of the second class. 

99. A reciprocal equation of the first class, and of odd 
degree, is obviously satisfied by x = — 1, and has, therefore, 
its first member divisible by x + 1. Since the remaining 
roots occur in reciprocal pairs, the quotient arising from this 
division will, equated to zero, be a reciprocal equation of even 
degree with its final term positive. 

In like manner, a reciprocal equation of the second class, 
and of odd degree, has its first member divisible by x — 1, 
and can thus be depressed to a reciprocal equation of even 
degree with its final term positive. 

A reciprocal equation of the second class, and of even degree, 
is evidently satisfied by both x = 1, and x = — 1 ; its first 
member is therefore divisible by x 2 — 1, and will furnish a 
quotient which, equated to zero, is a reciprocal equation of 
even degree with its final sign positive. 

Every reciprocal equation is therefore either of even degree 
w T ith its final sign positive, or may be reduced to that form 
preparatory to depression by the following theorem 

100. Prop. I. — A reciprocal equation of even degree with 
its last term positive, may he depressed to an equation of one- 
half the degree of the proposed. 

Let x- m + C x x* m ~ l + C 2 x^- 2 + . . . C 2 x 2 + C x x + 1 = [1] 
be the proposed equation. 

Collecting in pairs the terms that are equidistant from the 
first and last, and dividing by x m , we have 

(z' l ' + ^)+Ci(z-"-' + ^ + cJ y x^- + ^) + &c.= 0. [2].

Let 
x H = y ; then

(■'"" + h) = ( x "" 1 + ^) (* + 9 ~ (** + sM = r ~ mr ~ 2 + &0, 

By substituting these values in [2] , we obtain an equation 
of the m"' degree in y, that is, an equation of half the degree 
of the proposed. Any root, as a, of this equation will give 

two roots of the proposed by means of the relation x + - = a; 

X 

or, x 2 — ax + 1 = 0. 
Ex. Let 2a; 6 — Ux 5 + 19a 4 — 19a; 2 + 12a; -2 = 0. 

Since both + 1 and — 1 are roots by inspection, we divide 
the left hand member by x 2 — 1, and obtain, 

2x* — 12a; 3 + 21a; 2 — 12a; + 2 = 0, 
therefore 2 (x 2 + -\ — n(x +-) + 21 = 0, 

and putting x -\ — - = ?/, we obtain 

x 

2(y 2 -2) -Uy + 21 = 0, 
or 2\f — 12y + 17 = 0, 

thence y = J (6 + a/2),

5. a 6 — 23a 5 — 84a 4 + 84a 2 + 23a — 1 = 0. 



BINOMIAL EQUATIONS. 

101. These equations are such as consist of two terms 

only, as, 

x n — A = 0, 

where A is a known quantity. This is the only extensive 
class of equations that are capable of complete solution by a 
general method. Their general solution, however, depends on 
De Moivre's formula, and is contained in works on Trigo- 
nometry. The following propositions comprise the theory of 
Binomial Equations and the solution of such cases as are 
readily solvable by algebraical processes. 

102. Prop. I. — The roots of a binomial equation are all 
different. 

For the first derived function of a" — A is nx n ~ l , and no 
value of x can make a" —A and nx n ~ l vanish simultaneously. 
See Art. 92. 

103. Cor. — Any algebraical quantity (that is, any quan- 
tity included under the general form a + bV — i, where 
a and b are real quantities, positive, negative, or zero), has 
n different n th roots. From the above equation we have 
x = \/A, and a has n different values (36). 

104. Prop. II. — All the n th roots of an algebraical quan- 
tity may be found by multiplying one of them by the n differ- 
ent n th roots of unity. 

For in the equation a" — ^4 = put ay for a, where a de- 
notes one of the n th roots of A. Then we have 

a n y n == a n ; or, y n = 1. 

From this we have y = yX Hence a = \ A = ay 
= «#!. 



DEPRESSION OF EQUATIONS. 69 

105. Since we can always, as in the preceding article, re- 
duce a binomial equation to the form x" ± 1 = 0, we shall, 
in the following propositions, confine our attention to this 
form. 

106. Prop. III. — If a be any root of the equation 
x n — 1 = 0, then any integral power of a will also ~be a root. 

For (a"') n = a mn = (a")" 1 = 1'" = 1. 

107. Cor. — It hence appears that the roots of the equa- 
tion x n — 1 = may be represented under an infinite variety 

of forms, since each term of the series ar™, a -3 , a -2 , ar l , 

a , c, a 2 , a 3 , . . . . is a root. Of these there cannot, however, 
be more than n essentially different, as otherwise the equation 
would have more than n roots. 

108. Prop. IV. — If a be any root of x n -f 1 == 0, then 
any odd integral power of a will also be a root. 

For (a m ) n = (a n ) m = ( — l) m = —1, if m is odd. 

109. Prop. V. — If m be prime to n, the equations 
x m — 1 = 0, and x n — 1 = 0, have no common root but 
unity. 

Let p and q be integers such that pm — qn = 1,* and 
suppose a is a root common to the two equations. Then, as 
a m = 1, and a n = 1, we have also a^" 1 = 1, and a* 1 = 1 
(105). Hence, by division, a*"' 1 -*' 1 = 1, or a 1 = 1 ; that is, 
the only common root is unity. 

110. Prop. YI.~- If n is a prime number, and a an 
imaginary root of x n — 1 = 0, then all the roots of the equa- 
tion are found in the series, 1, o, a 2 , a 3 , a' 1-1 . 

For these are all roots by Prop. V ; and no two of them 
are equal. For, if possible, let a^ = a«, then a^ _ « = 1, 
that is, a is a root of x p ~ q — 1 = 0, and also of x n — 1 = 0, 
which is impossible, since p — q being less than n must be 
prime to it. 

* Such integers can always be found by algebra. 



70 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

111. Prop. VII. — The solution of x n — 1 = 0, tvhere n 
is a composite number, may be made to depend upon the solu- 
tion of the equations x p — 1 = 0, x q — 1 = 0, &c, where 
p, q, r, &c, are the different prime factors of n. 

First suppose n = pq, where p and q are prime to each 
other. Then x n — 1 = 0, or x pq — 1 = 0, is divisible by 
both x p — 1 and x q —l. By Prop. VI, the roots of # p — 1 = 0, 

are, 

1, a, a 2 , a 3 , . . . . a* -1 , 

and those of a? — 1 = 0, let us suppose are, 

1, ft 2 , 0», . . . . 0*- 1 , 

and all these are roots of x n — 1 = 0. Also the products 
formed by multiplying each term in the first row by each 
term in the second are all roots. For each of these products 
is of the form a r (3\ and since a" 1 = 1, and (3 sn = 1, therefore 
(a r (3 s ) n = 1, that is, a r (3 s is a root. Moreover, no two of these 
products are alike. For, if possible, suppose a r (3 s = a* (2°, 
then a r ~ l — (3 V ~ S . But as a r ~ l is a root of x p — 1 = 0, and 
ft-* a root of x q — 1 = 0, these equations have a common 
root besides unity, which (110) is impossible, since p and q 
are prime to each other. Therefore the pq products, formed 
by multiplying each root of x p — 1 = by each root of 
x q — 1 = 0, are the roots of x pq — 1 = 0, or x 11 — 1 = 0. 

In the same way, if n be the product of three prime factors 
p, q, r, it may be proved that the roots of x n — 1 = are 
the pqr products obtained by multiplying together the roots 
of the equations x p — 1 = 0, & — 1 = 0, x r — 1 = ; and 
similarly for any number of prime factors. 

112. Again, let n be a power of some number, as n = p*. 

Suppose the roots of x p — 1 = are 

1, a, a 2 , a 3 , . . . . a p ~\ 
then these as well as 

1, ^a ; <V~a\ ya%....$a p -' 

are roots of x p *— 1 = 0, as is also the product of each root 
in the first row by each root in the second. We have there- 



DEPRESSION OF EQUATIONS. 71 

fore p 2 different quantities of the general form a r • tya* all 
satisfying the proposed equation, and these are therefore all 
the roots. 

But by the solution of x p — 1 = we obtain only the p 
roots given in the first row above; those in the second row T 
must obviously be determined by solving the proposed equa- 
tion. A similar remark applies when n = jf, where r = 3, 
or any greater number. 

Tims w T e can find all the roots of x 15 — 1 = by solving 
^-1 = 0, and x 3 — ! — 0; but if X s — 1 = be given, 
we can find by this method only five roots, and if x 49 — 1 = 
be given, only seven roots. 

113. Prop. VIII. — The solution of mi equation af ± 1 = 
may be reduced to that of an equation cf not more than one- 
half the degree of the projjosed equation, and having all its 
roots real. 

For, taking the most unfavorable case, x n + 1 = 0, where 
n is an even number, and the equation has therefore no real 
root, we see that this is a reciprocal equation of even degree 
with its final term positive;, it may therefore (100) be depressed 
to an equation in y of one-half the degree of x n -f- 1 = 0. 

As # =. x + - , or x 2 — yx + 1 = 0, y, being the sum of 
a pair of conjugate roots, is real. 

X" — 1 = 0, when n is even may be depressed two degrees 
by dividing by x 2 — 1 ; and x n ±1 = 0, when n is odd, may 
be depressed one degree by dividing by x ± 1. In either case 
the depressed equations are reciprocal equations of even degree 
with their final terms positive, and these again may be de- 
pressed to equations in y of less than one-half the degree of 
the proposed equations. 

Ex. 1. z 3 — 1 = 0, 

.-. (x—l)(x 2 + x + l) = 0. 

Hence the roots are 1, and — -J- (1 ± V— 3), which values 
are the cube roots of unity. By changing their signs, we 
obtain the three cube roots of — 1. 



72 ALGEBKAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Ex. 2. &* -f 1 = 0. 

Putting y = x -\ — , we obtain y 2 — 2 = 0, whence 

y = ±V2, 
and x* + 1 = (a 3 + a/2 ■ a+1) (z 2 — \/2 ■ s + 1), 

from which we obtain as the four fourth roots of unity, 

i(V2± V^2), and - i(V% ± V^2). 

Ex. 3. x 5 — 1 = 0. 

From this, dividing by x — 1, we obtain 

x± + # 3 + a 2 + x + 1 = 0. 
Putting ^ = a; + - , we have 

V 2 + y — 1 = j whence ?/ = — -J- (1 ± a/5). 
Therefore 
a: 5_ 1 _ ( g ^l) (g? + * + / 5 • x +1) (a? + 1 ~» -g+1), 

/y /y 

whence we obtain as the five fifth roots of unity, 



1, i( A /5-l±j/-10-2v / o), -1^5 + 1 ±j/- 10 + 2\/o). 
These, with changed signs, are the fifth roots of — 1. 
Ex. 4. x G — 1 = 0. 

By Prop. V, the solution will be effected by finding the 
roots of a? — 1 = 0, which are 1 and — J (1 ± V— 3), and 
those of x 2 — 1 = 0, which are 1 and — ] ; the products 
of these sets of roots will furnish the six sixth roots of unity. 

114. When we proceed in the same way to solve x 1 — 1 = 0, 
we obtain a reduced equation in y of the third degree ; for 
x 9 — 1 = 0, a reduced equation in y of the fourth degree, 
and so on. 

These algebraical methods of obtaining the roots of bi- 
nomial equations are of little practical importance, since, as 
before mentioned, the roots of such equations are most readily 



DEPRESSION OF EQUATIONS. 73 

and symmetrically obtained by the aid of De Moivre's For- 
mula. 

115. Besides the three preceding classes of equations, any 
equation is capable of depression when we know that the roots, 
or some of them, are known functions of each other. If the 
roots, for example, are known to be in geometrical, or arith- 
metical progression, we can by means of the known relations 
between the roots and coefficients, Art. 45, easily depress the 
proposed equations to others of lower degree. 

In general, if the relation a 2 = (j> («i) is known to exist 
among two of the roots, a x , and a 2 , of f(x) = 0, we may 
depress the equation as follows : 

Substitute </> (x) for x in f(x), and let F(x) be the result- 
ing function. Then we have both f(x) = 0, and F(x) = 0, 
when x = a x . For a Y is a root of f(x) = by supposition, 
and to put a x for x in F{x) is equivalent to putting a 2 for x 
in f(x). Therefore f(x) and F(x) have a common factor 
x — a L which can be found. Then a x being known, a 2 = («i) 
becomes known, and the equation may be depressed two di- 
mensions. 

Ex. Suppose it is known that two roots a Y and a 2 of 

a* _ 9^3 + 7^2 + 6a; + 16 = 0, [1] 

are such that a 2 = 3« L -f 2. 

Substitute 3x -f 2 for x in the equation, then 

(33 + 2)4 — 9(3^ + 2)3 + 7(3^ + 2) + 6(3a; + 2) + 16 = 0, 
or, 81a* — 2W — 207a; 2 — 126a; + = 0, 

or, 9a; 3 — 3a; 2 — 23a; — 14 = 0. [2]. 

We find (a;-2) as the G. C. M. of [1] and [2]. Therefore 
cii = 2, and a 2 = 3a x +2 = 8. Thus we find 

34 _ 9a- 3 + 7a; 2 + 63 + 16 = (3-2) (3—8) (a; 2 + a; + l), 

and the depressed equation is 

x 2 + x + 1 = 0. 



74 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

116. Whenever in the course of the analysis of an equation 
we find a commensurable root a x , it is advisable to depress 
the equation by dividing by (x—a^), since we thus greatly 
facilitate the finding of the remaining roots. As these com- 
mensurable roots will present themselves in the course of the 
preliminary analysis recommended in Chap. X, we consider it 
unnecessary to make a special research for such roots, which 
are of comparatively rare occurrence.

CHAPTEK VII. 

SOLUTION OF EQUATIONS BY GENERAL FORMULAS. 

117. The only equations for which general solutions have 
been found are those of the first four degrees, and the equa- 
tions that can be depressed to any of those degrees. 

Leaving aside equations of the first and second degrees, 
which are fully treated of in elementary algebra, we propose 
in the present chapter to give the algebraical solution of cubic 
and biquadratic equations. 

CUBIC EQUATIONS. 

118. By the method given in Art. 71, any proposed cubic 
may be reduced to the form, 

x 3 + qx + r — 0. [1]. 

Assume that x is the sum of two other unknown quantities, 
that is, x = y -\- z ; 
then x 3 = Syz (y + z) -f- y 3 + z 3 ; 
in this replacing y + z by x, and transposing, we have 

2? _ z yzx _ (tf + z*) = 0. [2]. 

In order that [2] may be identical with [1] we must have, 

Syz = - q, (1), and f + # = - r, (2). 

Q 3 

From (1) we have y 3 z 3 = — ^- , and from (2), y 3 + z 3 
= — r ; thus the sum, y 3 -f z 3 , of two unknown quantities 

being given, and their product yh 3 , we can determine the 

a 3 
quantities by the quadratic equation t 2 + rt — ^ = 0, which 

/it 

is called the reducing equation. Solving this equation, we 
have

and, since a; = 2/ + 2, we have the general formula for the 
roots, 

» + w - ^vpi +ti-^i = ■ 

By Art. 113 the cube root of y 3 may be any of the three 
expressions, 

and the cube root of z 3 any of the three, 

z, £(_H-</=3)s, ^(-l-V^S)^ 

where 2/ and 2 are the arithmetical cube roots of y 3 and z 3 ; 
there would, therefore, be nine values of x, if we could take 
any one of the three values of tyy 3 with any one of the three 
values of %/z 3 . But one of the conditions employed in ob- 
taining the reducing equation was yz = —J~, that is, the 

product of any pair of cube roots admissible in the solution 
must be a real quantity. It will be seen that the only pairs of 
the cube roots that satisfy this condition are, 

x = y + z, 

x = i (-l + V^3)y + i(-l-V^3)z = -i\(y + z) + (y-z)V^\, 

x = K-i_v^)y+K-i+V=8)i = -i\ (y+«)-(jr-*)V^8l. 

and these are the three roots of x 3 -f- ^ + r = 0. 

119. The occurrence of nine different values of tyy 3 + %/z 3 
is explained by the fact that in the process of solution we 

cubed the expression yz — -~ . Now yh 3 maybe the cube 

o 

of any of the expressions yz, \ (— 1 + V— S)yz, or 
i (— 1 — V— 3) ?/2 , so that we really obtain the roots of 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 77 

three different cubic equations in the formula. The entrance 
of extraneous values into the solution of an equation that has 
been squared to free it from radicals is a familiar experience 
in the solution of quadratic and similar equations. 

120. We have now to consider the arithmetic possibility of 
tho solution obtained. 



X + $, > 0, then a/ j + ^ 



values of y and z can be determined, and the equation has 
one real root, y + z, while the other roots J { (y + z) 
± (y — z ) V — 3 \ are evidently imaginary. 

Ex. 1. x z — 6x — 40 = 0. 



x = y 20 + a/400 — 8 + j/20 — V400 — 8 
= a/39.799.. + a/. 2.... 

= 3.4142.... + -5848 = 3.999.... 

We infer that x = 4 is a root, and find upon trial that it 
is so. In this example the remaining roots are most readily 
found by depressing the proposed cubic to the quadratic 

x 2 + 4:X 4- 10 = 0, the roots of which are x = — 2 ± a/— 6. 

Ex. 2. x s + 12z + 4 = 0. 



— y — 2 -f a/4 + 64 + |/ — 2 — a/4 + 



64 



= a/6.24621... + V— 10 .24621... 

= 1.84165.. -2.17197... =—.33032... 

The other roots are most conveniently found by the formula; 
they are x= — 1(. 33032... ± 4.01363. .V^S). 

(2). When — -f —■ = 0, the formula reduces to 

v / 4 27 



v/^ + fa - *v/^ 



78 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

In this case, since y and z are equal, the formula for the 
remaining roots becomes x = — \ (y + z), that is, there are 
two equal roots. 

Ex. 3. a? — 21x — 54 = 0. 



y 27 



+ V729 - 729 + Y 27 - V729 - 729, 
= 2^27 = 6; 
the remaining roots are x = — 3, x = — 3. 

(3). When j + ^ < 0, then W — + Jr is impossible, 

and all the expressions for the roots are impossible. But we 
know that the equation, being of odd degree, must have at 
least one real root. Moreover, the expression V# 3 must have 
a root of the form m + nV—1, and, as z 3 differs from y 3 
only in the sign of the quadratic radical, Y& must have a 
root m — nV— '1. Substituting these in the expressions 

y + %> — i \ (y+ z ) ± (y— z ) ^-^ \> we obtain 

277i, and —?n±n Y$ ; 
the roots are therefore all real. 

Ex. 4. x* — 57s — 56 = 0. 



x = y 28 + V-6075 + y 28 — V-6075 

= |/28 + 45 V 17 ^ + j/ 28 — 45 V^ 

We possess no arithmetical method of extracting these cube 
roots, though it will be found upon trial that 



|/28 + 45a/^3 = 4+a/^3; and \/ 28-45V-3 = 4— V-3. 

Thus, in the case when the roots are all real 'and unequal, 
the formula is practically unavailable for purposes of arith- 
metical computation, since we are not able to perform the 
operations indicated. On this account this is sometimes 
called the Irreducible Case of Cardan's Formula. 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 79 

121. That y and z are necessarily imaginary expressions, 
when all the roots are real and unequal, and what functions 
these expressions are of the roots, may be shown as follows : 

Since the equation x 3 + qx + r = has any one of its 
roots equal to the sum of the other two with contrary sign, 
the roots must be of the form 2a, — (a + j3), — (a— (5), 
where a is always real, while (3, the semidifference of two 
of the roots, may be real, zero, or imaginary. Therefore we 
may put 

x 5 + qx + r = x* — (3a 2 + j3 2 )z — (2a 3 — 2aj3 2 ) = ; 

from this identity we have 

3« 8 + s = — q (1), 2a3 — 2a/3 2 — —r (2), 

from which to find a and (3 in terms of q and r. 

Thus J + jj = (a»-o0»)» - (a 2 + ^)3

80 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

that we possess no arithmetical method of obtaining these 
cube roots in a finite form even when a and (3 are commen- 
surable. Had we any means of obtaining a -\ — and 

3 V — 3 

a === , their sum, 2a, would give one root, and their 

V— 3 

difference multiplied by £v — 3, would give ft enabling us 

to find the other roots a ± ft We also see : 

(1). When (3 is real, the roots 2a, — (a ± (3), are all real; 

but — == is imaginary, and the formula necessarily assumes 

V — 3 
the so-called irreducible form. 

(2). When (3 is zero, the part under the quadratic radical 
vanishes, the formula becomes x = V^ 3 -f- Va?', and the 
roots are, 2a, —a, —a, i. e., there are two equal roots. 

(3). When (3 is imaginary, is real, and there is one 

V — 3 

real root, 2a, the others, — (a ± (3), being imaginary. In 

this case, the quadratic radical in the formula being possible, 

we can find its square root, and then obtain approximate 

values for the cube roots whose sum = x. 

122. We have seen that the criterion for the roots being 
all real is, that -r + ~ , or 27r 2 + 4=q% must not be a nega- 
tive quantity. With the notation employed in (121), we have 
27y2 + ± ( f - _ 4 (81a 4 ft - 18a^ + ft 5 ") = — 4/3 2 (9a2 — ft*) 
= — 4ft(3a-f (3) 2 (3a— (3) 2 , which last expression is obviously 
the product of the squares of the differences of the roots. 
Hence, if the roots 2a, — (a ± (3) are all commensurable, 
the expression, 27r 2 + 4=rf, must be a perfect square, which is 
the product of at least two squares different from unity. If 
there is but one commensurable root, it may be shown that 
the same expression must have at least one factor a perfect 
square different from unity. 

123. Many vain attempts have been made to discover a 
process for obtaining in a finite form the cube roots of ex- 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 81 

pressioDS of the form m + nV— h But just as the extrac- 
tiou of the square root of such an expression involves the solu- 
tion of a quadratic equation, so the extraction of the cube root 
of m + nV — 1 requires the solution of a cubic equation, 
which will be found to be the original cubic that led to that 
expression. 

124. The expression (m -f n V— 1)* mav > & * s true, be 
expanded in a series by means of the Binomial Formula. 
We thus obtain an approximate value of (m + n V— 1) 3 of 
the form P-\- QV—1 ; an approximate value of (m—nV—1)^ 
must therefore be P — QV—1; thus we obtain 2P as an 
approximate value of x. This method, however, is of no 
practical use, as the calculations are laborious and the series 
are usually of slow convergence. 

125. The roots of a cubic may also be obtained by means 
of a table of sines and cosines ; we shall merely indicate the 
process. 

By trigonometry we know that the equation 

cos 3 — |cos 6 — Jcos 30 = 0, [1]. 

has for roots, cos 0, cos (120° + 0), cos (120° — 6). 

Now if the proposed equation be x z — qx — r = 0, we 
can, by Art. 59, transform it into another the roots of which 

are those of the proposed each multijilied by A / — ; thus, 

*-»— Vl? = - a [3] - 

If we assume [2] as identical with [1], we have 

y = cos (9, and ^\/^r^ = icos30, or r\ / j-g = cos SO. 

As the cosine of no angle can be greater than unity, this 
last equation can hold true only when %V is not greater than 
4^ 3 , i. e., when all the roots are real. The roots of [2] are 



82 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

therefore cos0, cos (120°+ 0), cos (120°— 0) ; and those of the 
proposed equation, 

v/y ' cos 0, A/y * cos (120° ± 6). 

To find these roots we determine from a table of cosines the 
angle whose cosine = ?*\/t-§ or \/ ~TT ' ^is an g^ e w iU 
be 30, one-third of which is : the cosine of multiplied by 

~ will be the greatest root ; and similarly for the other

roots. 

EXERCISES. 

Solve, by Cardan's Formula, the following equations : 

1. s 3 + 6x + 2 = 0. 

2. a 3 — 12s — 20 = 0. 

3. s 3 + 7s — 7 = 0. 

4. s 3 + lis + 8 = 0. 

5. 5s 3 — 13s — 52 = 0. 

6. lis 3 — 56s + 105 = 0. 

126. In conclusion it may be observed that all attempts at 
an algebraical solution of the cubic, lead to a formula similar to. 
or identical with, that of Cardan. Among others, Tschirnhau- 
sen, Tischendorf and Lagrange, by very different paths, arrive 
at the same result. We shall indicate the following investiga- 
tion, which the student may work out as an exercise. It may 
be easily shown that the equation s 3 + 3s — (a z —a~ s ) = has 

a root a . Any proposed cubic s 3 -f- qx + r = may 

a /27 

(59) be transformed to y z + ?>y + r\ / —^ = 0. We have 

now to find a from the equation a s — a~ 3 = — r \ / — , or 
a? + A / — g- • a z — 1 = 0, and this, we find, leads to a for- 
mula for s similar to that of Cardan. 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 83 

In a subsequent chapter we shall take up the solution of 
eubics by Horner's Method, and it will be seen that the com- 
putation of a root of a cubic of the form x 3 + qx + r — 
is a matter of no more difficulty than the arithmetical extrac- 
tion of a cube root. 



BIQUADRATIC EQUATIONS. 

127. Of the various algebraical solutions of the biquadratic 
that have been proposed, the first, historically, is that discov- 
ered by Ferrari, a pupil of Cardan's, soon after the publication 
of that solution of the cubic known as Cardan's. 

Ferrari's Solution. — Let the proposed equation, de- 
prived of its second term, be a 4 -f qx 2 + rx +s — 0, then 

x* = — qx 2 — rx — 5. 

Add to both sides of the equation 2Jcx 2 + I 2 , then 

(x 2 + hf = {2k - q) x 2 - rx + (*? - *)■ 

We have now to determine h so that the second member 
may be a complete square. In order that this may be the case, 

we must have (21c— q) (h 2 —s) = ~r > or 

£3 _ Jgjp _ fa _|_ (L qs _ l r 2) - 0. 

From this, the so-called reducing cubic, having determined 
a value of k, by any of the methods given for the solution of 
eubics, the solution of the proposed biquadratic is reduced to 
that of the two quadratics, 



x 2 -f h = V2h—q ' x — Vh 2 — s, 
x 2 -f h = - \/2k—q ' x -f- \/lc 2 — s. 

The following solution is, however, generally more con- 
venient. 

128. Descartes' Solution.— As before, let the proposed 
equation be 

34 _|_ g X 2 + rZ + S — 0, [1] 



84 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

and assume the first member to be the product of two qua- 
dratic factors (x 2 -f hx + /) and (x 2 — lex -f g), thus, 

* + if + g-V)^ + {gh-fk)x+fg = 0. [2]. 

Equating coefficients of equal powers of x in [1] and [2], 
we obtain the equations, 

f + ff—&= q> gk—fk— r, fg = s. [3]. 

Having found / and g in terms of h from the first two of 
these equations, and substituting in the third, we have 

(W+l + q)(W-l + q)=is, 
from which we obtain by reduction, 

£6 + 2 q& + (q 2 - 4s) h 2 - r 2 = 0, 
or, putting z for h 2 , we have the reducing cubic, 

z z + 2qz 2 + (q 2 — 4:s)z — r 2 = 0. 

"When from this cubic a value of z has been determined, its 
square root is h, and k being known, / and g become known 
from the first two of the equations in [3], and we obtain 
the four roots of the biquadratic from the two quadratics, 
x 2 + hx + / = 0, x 2 — kx + g = 0. 

Ex. x* — 2±x 2 + 15x — 2 = 0. 

The reducing cubic is, 

# _ 48^2 + 5 8 42 _ 225 = 0. 

From this we find one root, z = 25, .\ h = 5, / = 2, 
g = — 1 ; and we can determine the four roots of the pro- 
posed from the equations, x 2 + bx + 2 = 0, x 2 — hx — 1 = 0. 

129. We shall give one more solution, of some interest as 
proceeding by a method analogous to that pursued in Cardan's 
solution of the cubic ; a method that has been applied to the 
solution of equations of higher degree than the fourth, and 
fails only in so far as that the reducing equations obtained are 
of higher degree than the original equation.

If we take x=y + z + u=± V~ii ± V~t 2 ± V^ 3 , 
we obtain eight different values for x. But some of these are 

inadmissible, since one of the conditions was yzu = — — , 

8 
so that, supposing r to be positive, the only admissible values 
of x are, 

— Vh—Vk—Vh, —Vti+Vh+Vk, Vh—Vh+Vh, 
Vk+Vh-Vh, 



86 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

namely those combinations the product of whose terms is 
negative. 
If r is negative, the admissible values of a are, 

Vh+Vl+Vh, Vti-Vt-z-Vt-s, -Vh+Viz-Vtz, 
—Vti—Vtt+Vh. 

131. The occurrence of the eight values of a in the solu- 
tion has an explanation similar to that given for the appear- 
ance of nine values for x in the solution by Cardan's For- 
mula (119). In the course of the solution we employed

negative, so that the solution contains the roots of the 
equation, 

& _l_ q X i — rx + s = 0, 

us well as those of the proposed equation. 

It may be remarked that the reducing cubic found by 
Euler's Method will be found to coincide with that obtained 
by Descartes' Method, if we put U = h 2 . 

EXERCISES. 

1. a 4 — 22a 2 — 21a + 30 = 0. 

2. a 4 — 7a 2 + 26x — 40 = 0. 

3. a 4 + 3a 2 + 2x + 3 = 0. 

4. a 4 — 12a 3 + 40a 2 — 29a + 6 = 0. 

5. 5a 4 + 22a 3 + 17a 2 - 36a - 21 = 0. 

132. The preceding methods of solution depend upon 
special analytical artifices, and have no apparent bond of 
union with each other, or with the methods of solution em- 
ployed for equations of lower degrees. By the method of 
investigation employed below it will appear that the algebraical 
solution of the quadratic, and all those given for the biquadratic 
above, are but particular cases of the solution of the general 
problem: to reduce the solution of an equation of the 2n th de- 
gree, to that of two equations of the n th degree. 

Let us suppose /(a) = 0, which is of the 2;J h degree, to be 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 87 

the product of two factors, <p (x) and i/> (x), each of the n tk de- 
gree, then 

Every function of even degree may, therefore, be regarded 
as being the difference of two functions, which are complete 
squares. If we can, then, resolve f(x) into the difference of 
two squares, we can reduce the solution of f(x) =0 to that 
of two equations of one-half the degree of f(x). For, trans- 
posing one of the squares in [1], and extracting the square 
root of both sides of the resulting equation, we have 

<P (s) + V> (x) _ , <t>{x) — i> (x) 

2 ~ * 2 

from which we obtain, according as we take the upper or 
lower sign with the second member, 

<p(x) = 0, or *p(x) = 0, 

two equations of one-half the degree of f(x) = 0. 

133. Theoretically this may be done ; but we can see in 
advance that, for equations of above the fourth degree, the 
reducing equations will be of higher degree than the proposed 
equation. For, from the %n binomial factors of f(x) may be 

\2n 
formed 7=- factors (x) and \1> (x), each of the n th degree 
\n\n T v ' r \ j> 

(45), hence from f(x) we may form the expressions <f>(x) ±\j)(x) 

\2n 
in if^f- different ways. It is evident, therefore, that the 

coefficients of the functions (p(x) ± ^p(x) may have $-. — =- 

different values, and will, consequently, have to be determined 
by equations of that degree. To find the degree of the re- 
ducing equations for equations of the second, fourth, and 
sixth degrees respectively, we substitute successively 1, 2, and 

\%n 
3, for n in nl 7 , and obtain 1, 3, and 10, as the numbers 

2\n\n 

expressiug the degrees of the respective reducing equations. 



88 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

The quadratic and biquadratic may therefore be reduced by 
means of reducing equations of lower degree ; but to solve a 
bicubic equation by means of two cubics, we should, except 
in particular cases (145), have first to form and solve a re- 
ducing equation of the tenth degree. 

134. To illustrate the process of obtaining the reducing 
equation, it will be sufficient to suppose f(x) of the sixth de- 
gree ; then </> (x) and i/> (x) will be each of the third degree. 

Let <p (x) = x 3 + m Y x 2 + m 2 x -f w 3 , 

ip(x) = x 3 + n x x 2 + n 2 x + n 3 ,

Changing 1 7" , &c, to A, B, C, and — ^r — -, &c, to 
«, b, c, and equating, we have, since (131) <f> (x) -f ip (x) 
= ±\4>(z) -*!>(*)}, 

x? + Ax 2 + Bx— C = ± (ax 2 + bx + c). 

Squaring both sides, and collecting terms, we have 

x* + 2 Ax 5 + (A 2 — ^ + 2B) x* + (2^15 — 2«6 + 2(7) g 3 
+ (^2 _ p + 2 J C- 2ac) x 2 + (250 — 21c) x 
+ (C* - c 2 ) = 0, [1], 

the equation of the sixtb degree having its coefficients ex- 
pressed as functions of the coefficients of 7T ■ From 

this we may deduce the corresponding equations of the fourth 
and second degree by omitting the letters that become zero; 
thus we obtain, 

«4 + 2Ax* + (A 2 -a 2 + 2B) x 2 + (2AB - 2ah) x 

+ {B 2 -V) = 0, [2] 
x 2 + 2Ax + (A 2 — a 2 ) = 0, [3]. 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 89 

135. We obtain the reducing equations by equating the 
coefficients of [1]. [2], or [3] with p, q, r, 8, &c, the co- 
efficients of like powers of x in the general equations. Ex- 
cept A (which always == \p), the coefficients B, C, &c, of 

will have to be determined, as shown above, by 

|2» 
equations of the k th degree, where h = -pf- , while a, b, c, 

& (%\ J) (%\ L_ I— 

the coefficients of ± , will, since they have the 

double sign, be involved in equations of the form (y 2 ) k + P(y 2 ) k ~ l 
+ Q {y 2 ) k ~ 2 + &c. = 0, which may also be solved as equations 
of the l 4h degree. 

136. It will be observed that, since in the equations [1], 

[2], [3], there are 2n — 1 unknown quantities, B, C, 

a, b, c, . . . . there will be 2)i — 1 forms of the reducing equa- 
tion, according as we eliminate for one or other of the un- 
knowns ; it will also be seen that one of these equations being 
formed, the others may be deduced from it by suitable substi- 
tutions. Thus there is but one form of the reducing equation 
for the quadratic, there are three distinct forms for the bi- 
quadratic, two of which have been given, and five for the 
bicubic. 

137. We shall first find, by this method, the reducing 
equation for the quadratic. 

Comparing the two forms of the quadratic, 

x 2 -f- px 4- q = 0, 

x 2 4. 2Ax 4- (A 2 — a 2 ) = 0, 

and equating corresponding coefficients, we have 

A = | ; 4 s - «' = % .- a? = q ', 

)) 2 4:(7 

whence a 2 = ± - — j — - , which is the reducing equation, and

we have for rv ; rv ' = ± v 7 yv ; 



p _ Vp 2 -±q 

X+ 2 - ± 2 



90 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

the usual form to which we reduce the quadratic, and equiva- 
lent to two equations of the first degree. 

138. Again, comparing the equation of the fourth degree, 

# 4 -f- px z -f- qx 2 -f- rx -f s = 0, 
and x*+2Ax*+(A 2 -a* + 2B)x*+(2AB-2a1))x+(BZ-&)= 0, 

we have, A=%; A 2 —a*-h2B = q; 2AB-2ab = r; B*-b 2 = s. 
From the second of these conditions we have 
«a = ^ + 2B-q, 

- - = ew ■ (4fc=)" 

from the third and fourth ; thence 

f oz? p 2 B 2 -2prB + r i , 

4L + 2B - q = 4(jB /l g) , whence 

8^3 _ 4^ + (2p r _ 8s)5 — (^ _ 4^ s + r 2) _ [!] . 

from which, if we put p = 0, we obtain 

SB S — ±qB* — 8sB + (iqs — r 2 ) = 0, 

the reducing cubic as found by Ferrari. 

139. The reducing cubic involving a may be found by 
elimination, as was the preceding one ; but it is more readily 
found by substituting in [1] the value of B in terms of a. 
The full equation thus obtained is, 

a« + [%q - ^) a" + (^ 4 - fq -f pr + qt- 4s) a 2 

_ / i 3 - ^ + 8?y = 

which becomes, putting p — 0, 

« 6 + 2</« 4 + (g» — 4s) a 2 — r 2 = 0, [2] 

the reducing cubic as found by Descartes and Euler. 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 91 

140. The reducing cubic involving b may either be found 
directly, or by substitution from the others ; it is, 

64£ 6 + (32pr + 64s— Wq 2 )^ + (Ap i r 2 —32prs—8p s qs—8q?> 2 )tf 

_ ( r *-2p 2 r 2 s-p** 2 ) = o, 

which putting p = 0, and 40 s = z, may be simplified to 
2 3 + (4 g _ g 2) ^ _ 2^ _ r 4 _ o. 

Having obtained any one root of any of the above reducing 
eubics, we can find the quantities A, B, a, b, from the relations 

2 A = p, 2B = a 2 -f q — A 2 ; 2b = P ~~" r> and then put 
the equation in the form, 

< f>(x) + V>(aQ _ , <j>{x)-^{x) 

2 " " ± 2 

that is, x 2 + Ax + B = ± (ax -f 0), 

and solve by two quadratic equations. 

141. We may examine what functions the roots of the re- 
ducing eubics are of those of the biquadratic. 

Supposing the roots of the biquadratic to be a, (3, y, d, 
and those of the reducing cubic of Ferrari, B Y , B 2 , B z , 
we have 

_ m, + n 2 _ aP + y d ay + fid ad + fiy 

*i-— g— -— tj— , ^2 = —^—, Z? 3 = — g— ; 

that is, the roots of Ferrari's reducing cubic are the three 
possible functions of the form T" — . Similarly the roots 
of the reducing equation in b are, since b — 2 ~ 2 , 

_ a(3 — yd _ ay — fid ad — (3y 
0i — s , 02 — n • #3 = « • 



Denoting the roots of Descartes' reducing cubic by a x 2 , a 2 2 , 
a 3 2 , then, since (133) a = — ~ — - , where — m denotes the 



02 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

sum of any two of the roots, ami — n the sum of the remain- 
ing two, we have, 

±a x = =F h(a + P-y-6), ±a 2 = =F i(o-i3 + y-d), 
±(h= =Fi(a-/3-y + d), also .4 = - £( a + + y + d), 
... K—^i—^—^—^) — ttj j(_^_ ai + a2 + fl 5 3 ) _ p 9 
i(— A+a v — a 2 + (h) = y, £(— A + a^Oz— « 3 ) = <J. 

If we suppose A = 0, 2*. e., ;; = 0, we obtain 
i (— fli — «2 — «3) = «> &c., 
the same results we obtained in (130). 

142. If the biquadratic has all its roots real, it is obvious, 
from consideration of what function of these the roots of the 
reducing equations are, that the latter are also all real. 

If the roots of the biquadratic are all imaginary, they must 
be of the form P ± QV^l and-iZ ± SV^I, and upon 
putting these for a, (3, y, 6 y in the expressions, 

a(S + yd / a [3-yd\ 2 
B\ = j-*-* ' bl = \ 2"/' ' 

2 (a + P-y-dV o 

we find that all the roots of the reducing cubics are real in 
this case also. 

If the biquadratic has two real, and two imaginary roots, we 
find, in the same way, that in this case each of the reducing 
cubics has two imaginary roots, or, possibly, two equal roots ; 
that is, the reducing cubic will not fall under the irreducible 
case when the biquadratic has two real and two imaginary 
roots. 

143. Upon consideration of the final terms of the different 
reducing cubics, we find that, if we have either p 2 s — ±qs 
+ r 2 = 0, jp — fyq + 8r = 0, or r 4 — 2]j 2 r 2 s — 7A 2 = 0, 
the biquadratic £ 4 -f px* + qx 2 + rx -f s = may be solved 
at once by means of quadratic equations, for this is equivalent 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 93 

to having either B { = 0, or b v = 0, or a v = 0, and we pro- 
ceed as in (140). 

Ex. 1. a 4 — W — 60a 2 + 221a — 1G9 = 0. 

Here we find p 2 s — ±qs + r 2 = 0. We proceed to reduce 

7) 7 
the equation to two quadratics as follows : A = -£ = •= , 

B 1 = 0, *> = A* + 25 - gr = ~ + + CO = -^ J 

17 
.-. Oi = ± -jr ; K 1 = B x 2 — s = 1G9, .\ J £ = ± 13 ; hence 

we have, 

a :2_^ + = ±(^S + 13), 

therefore we have 

a? _ 22a; + 13 — o, and a 2 -f 5a; — 13 = 0. 

Ex. 2. a 4 — 14a 8 + 63a 2 — 98a + 24 = 0. 

Here we find p % — kpq -f 8r = 0, therefore a x = 0. Pro- 
ceeding as before, we find A = — 7, B = 7, #i = ± 5, 
and have the two equations, 

^2 _ 7^ _+_ 7 = ± 5 . 

Ex. 3. a 4 + 3a 3 — 4a 2 + 9a + 9 = 0. 

Here w T e find r 4 — 2p 2 r 2 s — p 4 s 2 = 0, therefore b x = 0, 

7 3 7 

5 = 3, « = ± - ; hence we have a 2 + ^ a + 3 = ± ~ a ; 

therefore 

a;2 _ 9 X + 3 _ o, and a 2 -f 5a + 3 = 0. 

144. A cubic equation may be put in the form, 

a 4 + px 3 -f qx 2 + rx = 0, 

that is, may be regarded as a biquadratic having one root 
x = 0. We may, accordingly, derive reducing equations from 
those given above for the biquadratic by simply leaving out 
the symbol s. We thus find the reducing equation for a cubic, 
found by this method, is itself a cubic. We also find that 



94 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

when iii a cubic equation, x* + px* -f- qx + r = 0, the rela- 
tion p 3 — kpq + 8r = holds good, the equation may be 
reduced as in (143). 

145. When we attempt to form the reducing equation for 
the bicubic, we obtain, as we might expect, an equation of the 
10th degree. Thus, like all others that have been tried, this 
method fails to reduce equations of the fifth or higher degrees 
by means of reducing equations of lower degree than the 
proposed. 

When special relations exist among the roots, reduction may 
be effected by equations much lower in degree. Thus in the 
equation, as found in (134), 

z* + 2Ax 5 + (A* -a + 2B)x* + {2AB - 2ab + C)x* 

+ (B*—tf + 2AC-2ac)x*+(2BC— 2bc)x+(C*-c*) = 0, 

if we put a = 0, i. e., suppose that of the roots the sum of 
one-half the number is equal to the sum of the other half, we 
see by inspection of the coefficients above that the quantities 
A, B, C, b, and c, may then be found by the series of simple 
equations, 

A=ip; B = i(4tq-p*); C=i(r-pB); a = 0; 

I =. VB* + pC—s ; c = VC* — v, 

that is, if in any equation of degree not greater than the sixth, 
the sum of one-half the number of roots be equal to the sum 
of the other half the equation may be reduced by inspection. 

Ex. Let x« — 10z 5 + 22^ + 11a; 3 — 50x* — U2x — 96 = 
be an equation having the sum of one-half its roots = 5, then, 
by the simple equations above given, we find 

A = -5, B=~\, C=-2, <z = 0, 2> = ±y, e = ±10, 
and we can put the equation in the form, 

a* _ 5x* - | a; - 2 = ± (~x + 10 V 
whence 

a* — 5x 2 — 10z — 12 = 0, and x 3 — 5x 2 -f 7x + 8 = 0. 



GENERAL FORMULAS. 95 

If, in an equation of the fifth degree, the sum of three of the 
roots is equal to the sum of the remaining two, we can, in the 
same way, reduce the solution to that of a cubic and a qua- 
dratic equation. 

Ex. 2. Let a 5 + 14a* + 43a 3 — 48a 3 — 258a — 72 = 
be an equation having three of its roots equal to the other two ; 
then, as in the preceding example, we find 

A = 7, B = — 3, C = — 3, a = 0, b = ± 15, c = ± 3, 

and we can put the equation under the form, 

x s + ;^2 _ 3z _ 3 = ± (15a; + 3) ? 

whence we obtain the two equations, 

a* + 7^2 _ iq x _ e = o, and a 3 + 7a + 12 = 0. 

EXERCISES. 

Depress the following equations by the methods exemplified 
in (143) and (145) : 

1. a 4 + 2a 3 — 3a 3 — 92a — 529 = 0. 

2. a 4 — 17a 3 + 30a 3 — 195a — 225 = 0. 

3. a 4 — 8a 3 + 20a 3 — 16a — 21 = 0. 

4. a 4 — 20a 3 + 117a 2 — 170a — 60 = 0. 

5. a 4 + 7a 3 — 20a 3 + 35a + 25 = 0.

CHAPTER VIII. 

sturm's theorem. 

146. In a preceding chapter were given several theorems 
regarding the limits between which the real roots of an equa- 
tion must be found. Allusion was also made to methods pro- 
posed by Eolle and Waring for separating the roots. The ob- 
jection to these methods was not only the excessive labor 
required in their practical application, but also the fact that 
they leave the number of real roots existing in an equation 
doubtful till we have actually ascertained the situation of 
each. 

The method about to be explained is the only one hitherto 
proposed by which the number of real roots can be deter- 
mined a priori. Comprising the solution of a problem that 
had engaged the attention of analysts for above two centuries, 
this method is distinguished as much by the simplicity of the 
process as by the exactitude of the results attained. 

147. Sturm's Functions. — Def. — Let X=0 be an 

equation of the n th degree, having no equal roots,* X Y the 

first derived function of X, and X 2 , X 3 , X n , the series 

of remainders obtained in performing the operation of obtain- 
ing the greatest common measure of X and X Y , care being 
taken to change the signs of each remainder before employing 
it as a divisor,f changing the sign of the last remainder also ; 
the series of functions, 

X, Xi, X 2 , X 5 , .... x„, 

we shall refer to as Sturm's Functions. 



* If the proposed equation have equal roots, the fact will be discovered (92) by our 
arriving at a zero remainder in the course of the process. It will be seen (156) that, 
in such a case, the theorem holds good for the preceding remainders. 

t In the ordinary operation for the G. C M. it is merely a matter of convenience 



STURM'S THEOREM. 97 

148. Sturm's Theorem. — Let a and (3 be two numbers, 
such that a < (3, then the excess in the number of variations 
of sign in the series of functions, 

X, X\ , X 2 , X z , . . . . X n , 

when a is substituted for x, over the number of variations 
when (3 is put for x, expresses the number of real roots of the 
equation X = that lie between a and (3. 

Let Qi , Q 2 , Qn-i , denote the quotients obtained in the 

successive divisions ; then, since the dividend is equal to the 
product of divisor and quotient, plus the remainder, or minus 
the remainder with its sign changed, we have the following 
relations existing among the functions : 

X = ft X 1 - X 2 , (1). 

X x = Q 2 X 2 - X 3 , (2). 

X 2 = & X 3 - X i} (3). 

Xr-\ = Qr X r — X r+ i, (r). 

X n . 2 = Q^Xn-i- X n , (n-1). 

From these equations we deduce the following conclusions : 

I. Tivo consecutive functions cannot vanish simultaneously 
for any value of x. For, if possible, suppose X x = and 
X 2 = at the same time. Then, by Eq. (2), we shall have 
X s = ; and if X 2 = and X 3 = 0, then, by Eq. (3), we 
have also X 4 — 0, and so on to the last equation, which will 
give X n = 0; but this is impossible, since, by supposition, 
X = has no equal roots, and therefore X n must be a nu- 
merical remainder, independent of x. 

II. When any function, except X, vanishes, the adjacent 
functions have contrary signs. Suppose, for example, X r in 
Eq. (r) vanishes, then we have X r . x = — X r+l . 

whether we do, or do not, change a remainder before employing it as a divisor ; here 
this change is an essential part of the process. Subject to this condition we may 
multiply or divide a remainder by any convenient number as in the ordinary process. 

5 



98 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

III. X and X x have contrary signs immediately before X 
vanishes for some value of x, as x = c, and immediately after, 
X and Xi have the same sign. 

Denote X and X x by f(x) and f x (x) ; put c ± h for x, 
then (7) 

/ [c ± h) =f(c)± hf (c) + &c, and /, (c ± h) = f(c) ± &c, 

and h may be taken so small that the signs of f(c ± h) and 
fi (c ± h) will be the same as those of the first term in their 
expansions that does not vanish. But /(c) = by suppo- 
sition, while, by I, / (c) cannot vanish at the same time. 
Therefore, when h is taken small enough, the signs of f(c±h) 
and /i (c ± h) are the same as those of ± hf (c), and / (c) 
respectively, and these differ in sign when h is negative, and 
vice versa; that is, X and X! have contrary signs when 
x = c — h, and the same sign when x = c + h, h being a 
quantity as small as we please. 

Hence, as x increases through c, a root of X = 0, one 
variation of sign is lost in the series of Sturm's Functions. 

IV. No variation of sign is either lost or gained when any 
function, except X, vanishes. 

For suppose X r to vanish for some value of x, then, by II, 
X r _i and X r+] have contrary signs, and with whichever of the 
two X r agreed in sign just before it vanished, it will agree 
with the other after it has passed through zero, and changed 
sign ; thus no variation of sign is either lost or gained when 
X r passes through zero. 

By I no two consecutive functions can vanish at the same 
time. If two or more, that are not consecutive, vanish for the 
same value of x, then, if X be one of them, it follows, by III, 
that a variation of sign is lost as x increases through that 
value ; and, if X is not one of them, by IV no variation is 
lost, or gained. Thus we see that Sturm's Functions never 
lose a variation of sign except when x increases through a 
root of X = 0, and no variation is ever gained. Hence 
the number of variations lost as x increases from a value a 
to a greater value j3 is equal to the number of real roots of the 
equation X = that lie betivcen a and fi. 



STURM'S THEOREM. 99 

149. Scholium I. — It may not be at once evident to the 
student how it is that X, which (III) is of the same sign as 
X x immediately after x has increased through a root of 
X = 0, is again of the contrary sign before x increases 
through the next root. This becomes clear upon considering 
that Xi, being the first derived function of X, must, by 
Art. 82, become zero, and therefore change sign for some value 
of x between any two successive roots of X — 0. Thus X x , 
which was of the same sign as X just after x increased 
through a root of X = 0, will be of the contrary sign before 
x increases through the next root of X = 0. By IV, this 
vanishing of X\ , or of any of the functions of inferior de- 
gree, does not alter the number of variations of sign in the 
series of functions, but merely changes the distribution of the 
plus and minus signs in the series. 

150. Sch. 2. — If for some value of x, any of the inferior 
functions, as X r , becomes zero, we may omit that function 
when counting the variations ; for the sign of the vanishing 
function must form a permanence with the sign of one or 
other of the adjacent functions. 

151. Cor. 1 . — If in the series of Sturm's Functions we 
successively put — co and -f co for x, the excess of the num- 
ber of variations produced by the first substitution over the 
number produced by the second is equal to the whole number 
of real roots in the equation. 

When ± co is put for x, the sign of a function is always 
the same as that of the highest power of x in that function ; 
the series of signs for x = + co is therefore the same as the 
series of leading signs in the functions ; the series of signs for 
x — — & may be easily derived from the preceding, by changing 
the signs of the leading terms that contain odd powers of x. 

152. Cor. 2. — In order that an equation of the n th degree 
may have all its roots real, it is necessary and sufficient tit at 
the functions be n + 1 in number, and all of the same sign 
in their leading terms. 

The functions will, in general, be n -f- 1 in number, since 
each remainder is usually only one degree lower than the pre- 
ceding one. If, then, there be n -f- 1 functions, all having 



100 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

the same leading sign, there will be n variations of sign when 
x — — </>, and no variation when x = + co ; there are 
therefore n real roots. If there be fewer than n + 1 functions, 
then, even when the leading signs are all alike, the substitution 
of — co for x will give fewer than n changes of sign, there are 
therefore fewer than n real roots. 

153. Cor. 3. — If the functions be n -f- 1 in number, but 
not all of the same leading sign, there are as many pairs of 
imaginary roots as there are variations in the leading signs. 

For suppose there are m variations of sign in the leading 
terms, then for x = + co there will be m variations and 
n — m permanences of sign. For x = — co the foregoing 
variations become permanences, and the permanences, varia- 
tions ; that is, for x = — co there are n — m variations. The 
excess of the number of variations for x = — co over the 
number for x = + co is, therefore, n — 2m ; thus there 
are n — 2m real roots in the equation, and consequently 2m 
imaginary roots. 

154. Cor. 4. — The number of positive real roots is equal 
to the excess of the number of variations in the signs of the 
final terms of the functions, over the number of variations of 
sign in the leading terms. 

For when x = 0, the functions reduce to their final terms 
and present as many variations of sign as these do, and for 
x = -f co the functions have the same signs as their leading 
terms; hence the number of variations in the signs of the 
final terms, diminished by the number of variations in the 
leading terms, represents the number of real roots between 
and + co. 

155. Thus, when once we have obtained Sturm's Functions, 
we can, by mere inspection of the signs, determine, not only 
how many of the roots are real and how many imaginary, but 
also how many of the former are positive or negative. 

To ascertain the situation of each of the positive roots, we 
successively substitute in the functions the series of numbers 

(', 1, 2, 3, &c, till we reach a number that makes the 

number of variations of sign in the series of functions equal 
to the number of variations in the leading terms. Each loss 



STURM'S THEOREM. 101 

of a variation in the signs of the scries of functions indicates 
the passing over a root. If more than one root be found to 
he between successive integers, we may proceed to substitute 
successive fractions till we separate the roots. 

The situation of the negative roots is determined in a simi- 
lar manner. 

156. The theorem has been proved on the supposition that 
X = has no equal roots. We shall now show how to pro- 
ceed when in the operation for finding Sturm's Functions we 
obtain a zero remainder, showing that the equation has equal 
roots. 

Let the equation X = have equal roots, then X, X Y , X 2 , 
and the functions that follow will have the last function X p as 
a common divisor. We can, by dividing X by the common 
divisor, obtain the function which, equated to zero, will (94) 
contain all the roots without repetition. But this is not 
necessary, since the factor X p , being common to all the pre- 
ceding functions, its presence or absence will not affect the 
number of variations of sign for any given value of x. For, 
if X p is positive for that value of x 9 its presence as a factor 
will not affect the series of signs at all, while if X p is negative 
it will reverse all the signs. Hence, when tve discover that 
X = has equal roots, by the fact of some remainder becom- 
ing zero, tve can employ the preceding functions to determine 
the number and situation of the real roots that are unequal. 

The common factor X p which contains the remaining roots 
may be analyzed separately to ascertain how often each root is 
repeated. 

157. If in the course of the operation for obtaining the 
functions X 2 , X 3 , &c, we come to one X r , which we know 
cannot change its sign, we need not proceed to find the re- 
maining functions. For in the demonstration of the theorem 
the necessary property of the last function is that it be 
incapable of becoming zero. As, by supposition, X r cannot 
vanish, the demonstration holds good for the functions from 
X to X r . The fact that a function cannot change sign is 
most readily observed in the case of a quadratic function, 
which will generally be the second from the final remainder.

ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 



As the labor of finding Sturm's Functions increases very 
rapidly with the degree of the equation, and especially with 
the last functions, it is of some importance to save, if possible, 
the labor of computing these functions. 

Ex. 1. Let the equation proposed for analysis be, 

X = x s — 4a: 2 — 11a? + 43 = 0, then 

X 2 = 2x ■ 
X 2 = 9. 
By Cor. 2, the roots are all real, and, Cor. 4, two are positive ; 
we arrange the series of signs for different values of x as in 
the following scheme : 



8* — 11,

There are at first two variations of sign, and the number 
continues the same till, for x = 4, we have one variation only : 
a root therefore lies between 3 and 4. For x = 5 the remain- 
ing variation is lost ; thus another root lies between 4 and 5. 

It will be sufficient to substitute for x in X alone, when 
but one root remains of a certain sign, as a change of sign in 
the final term will show when the root is passed. Thus to 
find the situation of the negative root in this example, we 
need only substitute negative values for x in X. We find this 
root to lie between — 3 and — 4. 



Ex. 2. 


Let X = x 5 — 5a? + 10x 2 — 20z — 15 = 0, then 




Xi = x* — ox 2 -f- 4:X — 4, omitting a factor 5, 




X 2 = 2x? — 6r* + 16« + 15, 




X 3 = 4.r 2 + 55x + 53, 




X 4 = - 3601a; + 3431, 




X 6 = -. 



STURM'S THEOREM. 



103 



In this example the sign only of the final function is deter- 
mined ; for this function, being independent of x, does not 
change sign. As in this, so in other examples, it will be 
sufficient to perform as much of the numerical work as will 
enable us to determine the sign of the final remainder, which 
sign, when changed, will be the constant sign of the final 
function. 

A glance at the leading signs informs us, Cor. 3, that the 
equation has two imaginary roots ; by Cor. 4, there is but one 
positive, and therefore two negative roots. Arranging the 
series of signs as before, we have,

By noting where the losses of variations occur, we see that 
the roots are situated in the intervals, (—4, —3), (—1, 0), 
(2, 3). 

Ex. 3. Let X = a? - 60a; 4 -f 10a; 3 - 120a; 2 + 6x - 1650 = 0, 
then X x = x 5 — 40a* 3 + 5a 2 — 40a; -f 1, 

X 2 = 4a, 4 — x 3 + 16a; 2 — x + 330,

Here we see by inspection of the leading signs that there are 
four imaginary roots, and of the real roots one is positive, the 
other negative. We can, therefore, readily ascertain the situa- 
tion of these roots from X alone. The roots lie in the inter- 
vals (-8, -7), (7, 8).

STURM'S THEOREM. 105 

159. The labor of computing these functions is evidently 
very great, and that of substituting different values of x in 
them, in order to ascertain the intervals in which the roots lie, 
is not much less, even when we content ourselves with deter- 
mining between what integers they lie. In the above example 
the three roots between and 1 are respectively .366600.., 
.366660. ., and .366661. ., all three concurring to four places 
of decimals, and two of them to five places, so that the task 
of separating them by means of fractional substitutions in 
Sturm's Functions would be even more laborious than that of 
obtaining the functions. * 

Upon the whole we must reach the conclusion that this 
celebrated theorem,! though the most important and interest- 
ing addition to the Theory of Equations that has been made 
in the course of the past two centuries, and though offering 
an infallible means of determining, not only the number of 
real roots in an equation, but also the exact situation of each, 
is too laborious in application to be generally available for 
equations of above the fourth degree. 

EXERCISES. 

Find the intervals in which lie the real roots of the follow- 
ing equations : 

1. a? - 6z 2 + 7x — 3 = 0. 

2. x* — Sx* + ldx — 11 = 0. 

3. 5s 3 — 39z 2 + 24z — 25 = 0. 

4. a* — 5z? + 3z 2 + Ix + 2 = 0. 

5. tf — & _ x * + 6 = 0, 

6. x 5 + x 3 — 2x* + Sx — 2 = 0. 



* It will be shown in the course of the next chapter, in connection with Horner's 
Method, how such roots may he readily separated without the aid of Sturm's 
Functions. 

t The theorem was discovered by M. Sturm in 1829 ; received the mathematical 
prize from the Academie Royale des Sciences ; was published in Memoires presentes 
par des Savans Etrangers, 1835.

CHAPTER IX. 

HORNEE'S METHOD.* 



160. In the preceding chapter a method has been given 
by which we can determine the situation of each real root in 
a proposed numerical equation. We have now to consider a 
method of remarkable simplicity and elegance, by which we 
can, after determining the first figure of a real root, ascertain 
its value exactly, if commensurable, or, if incommensurable, 
to any degree of approximation desired. 

161. Suppose that in an equation f(x) = a positive real 
root is x = a + a' -f- a" + &c, where a, a', a", &c, are its 
successive figures in descending order of the decimal scale, 
and that by a previous analysis, or by trial, we have ascertained 
the first figure a of this root. We proceed to transform 
f(x) = into another equation f (a + x') = 0, whose roots 
are those of f(x) = 0, each diminished by a. We now pro- 
ceed to ascertain the next figure a' of the root to which we 
are approximating, and then transform / (a + x') = into 
another equation whose roots are each less by a'. Proceed- 
ing in this way, we determine in succession the figures 
a, a', a", &c, till we have either obtained the root exactly, 
or to as many figures as are necessary to the degree of approxi- 
mation required. 

The points in which the superiority of Homers Method 
consists are : (1). The successive transformed equations are 
obtained from the preceding equation by the compact and 
easy process already given in Art. 69. (2). After the first 
figure of the root has been obtained, we are guided with more 



* This method, named after its author, Mr. Horner, of Bath, England, was pub- 
lished by him in the year 1819. 



HORNER'S METHOD. 107 

or less exactitude to the next figure by a process which 
shall presently be explained. (3). After a few figures of the 
root have been determined, we can very much contract the 
operation, which ultimately becomes a case of contracted 
division. 

We shall now consider in order, I. The Method of Trans- 
formation ; II. The Method of Trial Divisors; III. The 
Method of Contraction. 

162. The Method of Transformation. — This has 
been already explained and illustrated in Art. 69 ; we apply 
it as follows : 

Let f(x) = 3a; 3 — 1326a; 2 -f 6576a; — 9177 = 0, and sup- 
pose we have ascertained that a root lies between 500 and 400 ; 
we proceed to transform f(x) = into /(400 + x') = 0, the 
roots of which, are those of f(x) = 0, each diminished 
by 400.

1200 








2274 = 


:i/ 2 (400). 







Hence the transformed equation, whose roots = x — 400, is 

3a;' 3 + 2274a;' 2 + 385776a;' - 17538777 = 0. 

We could now proceed to find by trial the next figure of the 
root (400 4. x'), and, when it is found, transform by the figure 
thus found; but we shall presently show how w r e may be 
guided to this figure without unnecessary trials. 

163. It is important to remark that if the root A, to 
which we are approximating, is the only positive root having a 
for its leading figure, then, in the transformed equation, A — a 
will be the smallest positive root, and the only one whose lead- 
ing figure is in that order of the decimal scale which is next 



108 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

below the order of a. For each root whose leading figure was 
less than a will be negative in the transformed equation, and 
all the roots whose leading figure was greater than a will have 
their leading figures of higher orders than a 1 , the leading figure 
of A — a. Thus supposing the roots of an equation to be 
7, 34, 49, 56.3, 78, 290, and we diminish each by 50, then 
we have, —43, —16, —1, 6.3, 28, 240, as the roots in the 
equation transformed by 50. 

If we again diminish each of these roots by 6, we obtain 
— 49, —22, —7, .3, 22, 234, as the roots in the second 
transformed equation. Thus the root towards which we are 
approximating becomes rapidly quite small as compared with 
the other roots. Similar remarks apply when there are two or 
more roots having the same leading figure. 

164. Method of Trial Divisors. — These are similar 
to those employed in the evolution of arithmetical roots, and 
are usually deduced as follows : 

If a + x' is a root of f{x) = 0, and x' is sufficiently small 
as compared with a, then — - ; { = %' approximatively. 

For, by Art. 69, when a + x' is put for x in f(x) = 0, 
then 

f{a + x') = C n x'»+ . . .+ifi{a)x'* +f l (a)x+f(a) = 0. 

Now if x' is small as compared with a, we may neglect all 
the terms involving higher powers of x' than the first ; thus 

we have f\{a)x' + f(a) = 0, or — ^j-4 = x' approxi- 
matively. 



165. The proposition is generally stated as above. It 
would be better to state the second condition under the form, 
if x' is small compared with the other roots. This will be 
more clearly seen from the following way of deducing the 
rule : 



HORNEK'S METHOD. 109 

Let a, p, y, 6, k, and x', be the roots of the trans- 
formed equation f(a + x') = 0, then, by Art. 45, we have, 

— f (a) = aj3yd. . .kx', and 

f x (a) = a(3yd. . .k + x'(Qyd. . .k -f ayd. . .« + &c.) 

f (a) afiyfi. . .kx' , 

/i(#) "" a{fyd. .K + x'((3yd. .n-\-ayd. .k-\-&c.) 
proximatively, 

when x' is small as compared with the other roots. 

166. The degree of approximation will evidently depend 
upon how small x' is as compared with the remaining roots, 
and will be in excess over, or defect from, the true value of x', 
according as a(3yd. . ,tc and x'((3yd. . .k -f &c.) have contrary 
signs or the same sign. 

Now in 163 we saw that, if a + x' was the only root having 
a certain leading figure, then x' is, even in the first trans- 
formed equation, a decimal as compared with the other posi- 
tive roots. Of the negative roots some may be numerically 
less than x' in the first transformation (see 163), but at the 
same time these negative roots tend to diminish the expression 
x'((5yd. . .k + ay 6. . .« + &c.) by making the products vary 
in sign. 

Thus upon the whole it will be found that, even in the first 
transformed equation, if we divide minus the final term by the 
preceding coefficient, the figure thus obtained will not be far 
from correct ; in many instances will be exactly so. In the 
second transformed equation the trial divisor will give the 
next figure of the root correctly, with comparatively rare 
exceptions. 

If the figure obtained is too great, we shall become aware 
of the fact before completing the first row of work in the next 
transformation, by seeing that the final sign will be changed, 
thus showing that the root has been passed over. We then 
try the next lower figure, and so on until we find one that does 
not cause a change in the final sign. If the figure obtained 
is too small, we shall not be warned of the fact in the same 
way, though we can generally infer, from the result produced 



110 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

on the final term, whether the figure would require to be 
increased. In case of doubt, it would be prudent to try in a 
bye-operation, whether the next higher figure would change 
the final sign, which it ought to do if the figure obtained by 
the trial divisor is correct. Finally, if at any part of the opera- 
tion we transform by a figure too small, we shall be informed 
of the fact by the next trial divisor giving a figure of too high 
order to be correct. 

167. Eesuming consideration of the transformed equation 
of 162, 

3a;' 3 + 2274^ 2 + 385776a'' — 17538777 = 0, 

_ ■' , /(400) 1753... , A t ,, . 

we find that — J x . , or - = 40 + ; we therefore 

transform by 40 as follows : 

3 +2274 +385776 -17538777 [40_ 

120 95760 

2394 481536 

We need proceed no further with this transformation, as it 
is obvious that, if completed, the final sign will be changed. 
We accordingly transform by 30, thus :

Hence the equation has a root 437, since /(437) = 0. The

tion Sx'"z + 26072;'"+ 566373 = 0, the roots of which, when

or * = . 08 + , we could proceed to transform again by 

. 08, and so on for the remaining figures of the root. 

169. In practice it is found convenient, however, to dis- 
pense with the decimal points. This we effect as follows : 
When, in an equation of the n th degree, we have diminished the 
root, to which we are approximating, till the next figure would 
be a decimal, we add n ciphers to the right hand working 
column when completed, (n — 1) ciphers to the next column 
when completed, and so on. This (59) is equivalent to multi- 
plying the roots each by 10, and by repeating this multiplica- 
tion at every transformation we are enabled to dispense with 
the troublesome decimal points in the working columns, the 
ciphers also serving to mark where a column was completed.

In every instance in this example we have found the trial 
divisor give the correct figure for the next transformation, and 



114 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

we could go on in the same way to find as many more figures 
of the root as may be desired. But when we examine the 
second working column, that which we employ as trial divisor, 
we observe that the addends from the column to the left have 
less and less influence upon the leading figures of this column. 
It is evident, indeed, that if we continue to perform the opera- 
tion without contraction, we shall soon have a large number 
of superfluous figures in the second and right-hand columns, 
which figures might be dispensed with without affecting the 
correctness of the result within certain limits. We therefore 
contract the work in the manner about to be explained. 

170. Method of Contraction. — When we have obtained 
a root to two places of decimals by the uncontracted process, ice 
can contract the operation by ceasing to add ciphers to the 
right-hand column when completed, by striking off one figure 
from the second column when completed, hvo from the third, 
three from the fourth, and so on. 

This, it will readily be seen, is equivalent to first supposing 
the coefficients formed as in the preceding article, and then 
dividing each by 10 n (n being the degree of the equation). 
Taking, for example, the coefficients of the third transforma- 
tion above, 

1 + 4520 +286400 -34520912000 +67867360000, 
and dividing each by 10,000, we have 

.0001 +.452 +28.64 —3452091.2 +6786736. 

With these contracted coefficients we proceed as before :

111 the first step of this contracted operation, the trial 

(678 \ 
' * ' 1 indicates 1 as the next figure of the root. 

Though we have struck off all the figures of the fourth work- 
ing column, yet (as in contracted multiplication) we allow for 
its influence upon the third column, which thus becomes 29. 
We complete the transformation by 1, and strike off figures as 
before. The trial divisor now indicates 9 as the next figure ; 
we take no further notice of the fourth column, but, though 
we have struck off the remaining two figures of the third col- 
umn, we carry 3 from it to the second column, since .29 x 9 
= 3 to the nearest decimal. We then complete the trans- 
formation, and strike off another figure from the second col- 
umn. The rest of the work is merely a contracted division. 
The approximated root thus obtained is x = 2.381966012. ., 
and is correct to the last figure, which would be 1 if obtained 
by the uncontracted process. 

171. Another root of the same equation lies between 4 and 
5 ; we proceed as on the following page to compute this root, 
contracting from the third transformation. 

Observe here that the sign of the final term is changed in 
the first transformation. This arises from the fact that a root 
has been passed, that which we computed in 170. We ob- 
serve also that the trial divisor suggests a number far above 
the true value of x'. This arises from the fact that x' is not, 
in this transformation, much smaller, numerically, than the 
next root. 

In the remaining transformations the trial divisor invariably 
suggests the true figure. The root thus obtained, 

x = 4.61803399.., 

is correct to the nearest decimal. 

172. To approximate to the negative roots of an equation, 
we change the signs of alternate terms, thus (61) changing 
negative to positive roots, and proceed as in the above exam- 
ples. The roots thus obtained will, taken with the negative 
sign, be the negative roots of the equation.

173. By this compact operation we are thus enabled, when 
once the leading figure has been obtained, to approximate to 
any real root of a proposed equation with just the same amount 
of numerical labor that would be required for the extraction 
of an arithmetical root of an order corresponding to the degree 
of the equation. The extraction of the n th root of a given 
number N is, in fact, nothing else than the solution of an 
equation of the form x 11 — N = 0, and may be performed by 
the same process, and with the same contractions, employed in 
the above examples. 



HOKNER'S METHOD. 117 

174. We have thus far supposed the root to which we wish 
to approximate to be the only one beginning with a certain 
leading figure. We can, it is true, by means of Sturm's 
Method, always separate real roots, however closely they may 
coincide. But, as shown in 159, the labor involved in doing so 
is excessive. It is now proposed to be shown that, guided by 
an extension of the rule above given in regard to trial divi- 
sors, we can safely proceed in the approximation by Horner's 
Method, even when there are in the given interval several 
equal or nearly equal roots. 

175. It has been shown in Art. 164, et seq., that in the 
transformed equation 

f(a+x') = C n x'»+ . . . . if 2 (a)** +/i («K+/(«) = 0, 
when x' is small compared with a, the part of the root 
already found, we may neglect all but the two last terms, 
A ( a ) + / («) = 0, from which simple equation we may ob- 
tain one or more figures of x'. Now if there are two nearly 
equal roots in the interval we are examining in f(a-\-x') = 0, 
then, since (82), the first derived equation* f L (a + x') = has 
a root lying between them, we should (164) obtain an approxi- 
mation to this root from the last two terms of 

A {a + x') = nCnX"- 1 + . . . . l/ 3 {a)x'*+f 2 {a)x' + f x (a) = 0, 

that is, — A( a ) -^-/2{ a ) = x ' approximatively when there are 
two roots having figures in common. 

Generally, if f (a + x') = has r equal or nearly equal 
roots, of which a is the leading part, then (82) the (r — l) th 
derived equation has a root lying between the two least of these 
roots; that is, 

/,_! (a+x') = /,. (a)x' + /_! (a) = 

has a root a little greater than the least of the r roots of 
f{a + x') = 0, and, by Art. 164, an approximation to this root 
is given by the expression — / ; „i (a) -~ f r (a). Therefore, 
writing the transformed equation as 

C n z'»+ .... C' r x*+ C' r -,x'^+ .... CV' 3 + C' 2 x'*+ C\x' 
+ Co = 0. 

* By the r^ derived equation is meant the r^ derived function equated to zero. 



118 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

and remembering that C' r = r—f r (a), we have 

G o G i 6 2 _ 6 r _i . 

~~C\' 2C 2 ' 3CV rC" r > 

as the respective expressions for suggesting the leading figure 
of the next transformation, according as there are one, two, 
three or r roots in the interval under consideration. 

We deduce, as follows, another set of expressions, which 
serve as a check upon those preceding. 

Let f(a + x') = (p(x r ) i>(x'), where *l>(x') is the product of 
r equal factors (x'—k) and <f)(x r ) the product of the n — r 
other factors, then putting 

<p{x') = C n x'"- r + D x x' + D , 

ip(x') = x' r — rKx' r ~\. . ±_rK r ~ l x' =F x r , 

.-. f(a + x') = C n x' n + ±{rD «r l -D^x'^D^ = 0, 

= C n x'»+ + C\x' +(7 , = 0; 

G n -L'o it K X , , 

/. Try- = — ^ =r = — , or — , nearly when n is 

small as compared with the other roots. 

If the factors in ip(x') are not absolutely, but yet nearly, 
equal, the above conclusion will still hold; thus the ex- 
pressions 



2<7' 3<7' rC'o 



C\ y d' G\ ' 

ought to suggest the same value of x' as the corresponding 

expressions in A, according as there are two, three, or r 

equal, or nearly, roots in the interval under examination. 

176. When, therefore, we have ascertained that there are 
several roots beginning with a common leading figure, we pro- 
ceed as follows : 

(1). Transforming in the usual way, we diminish the roots 
by this common figure. \ 

(2). By means of the proper expression in A we determine 
the next figure. If the expression (A) at this stage suggests 
the exact figure, that from (B) will usually agree with it. 



HORNER'S METHOD. 110 

(3). We continue, at each transformation, to ascertain, in 
the same way, the common leading figures in succession, till 
either a discrepancy in the figures suggested by the expressions 
(A) and (B) warns us that the roots no longer coincide, or a 
change in the final sign shows that we have separated a root, 
which will be the least of those to which we were approxi- 
mating. 

(4). When we have thus separated a root, or group of roots, 
as the two groups do not differ much from each other in value, 
the divisors will not again be effective till we have ascertained 
the correct leading figure of each group and performed a 
transformation by that figure. We may then proceed sepa- 
rately with the approximation of each group, guided by the 
expressions in (A) and (B) appropriate to the number of roots 
in the group, till we separate these roots also, and carry on 
the approximation to each single root by means of the ordinary 
trial divisor as far as desired. 

Ex. 1. The equation 

z 4 — 437z 2 + 3660 + 2826 = 

has two roots between 12 and 13 ; we proceed to develop them 
as shown on the next page. 

2C' Q 4680 _, 
In the first transformation we find -^r , or -^- = 7 + , 

and — ^r > or imT = 8 + ' we transform b y ?> and muI 
that figure correct. In the next transformation we find both 
B4 Q 1 C * 2 and _ r f n 26 suggest 0.8; we accordingly, consider- 

ing as a figure of the root, add other ciphers to the working 
columns, and transform by 8. In the next transformation we 

begin to contract ; both ■ and — — - indicate 2 as the 

next figure, In the next transformation, after striking off the 

1 71 v 2 456 

contraction figures, we find - indicates 0, and 5Q 2 

indicates 4. The roots therefore coincide no further ; we find 
that 1 produces a change of sign in the final term, showing

HORNER'S METHOD. 125 

verify this inference will be hereafter adverted to (187). To 
compute the remaining figures of the third root, whose leading 
figures were .142, we take the transformation at which the 
roots separated, and finding by trial the next figure 8, we pro- 
ceed by the contracted process to find some more figures, the 
trial divisor indicating the remaining figures correctly. We 
thus find the third root, x = .14285714. .. 

177. These examples show that Horner's Method is quite 
equal to the separation of, and approximation to, roots, how- 
ever closely coinciding in their leading figures. Such equal, 
or nearly equal, roots, which have usually been regarded as 
presenting great difficulties to the calculator, may really be 
approximated to with greater facility than the others, since, 
guided by the trial expressions A and B, we are enabled to 
calculate a part of several roots simultaneously as far as they 
coincide, and then pursue the approximation with contracted 
coefficients after the single roots, or groups of roots, diverge. 
For practice we subjoin a few equations, each having a pair of 
roots lying between and 1, and coinciding for several figures. 
When, as in these examples, there are only two such roots in 
a given interval, the separation is easily effected by means of 

26" C ' 

the trial expressions -^rr and — —^ , which will suggest 

the same figures till the roots separate. At that point, we find 
by trial the correct leading figure for each, and after transform- 
ing, carry on the approximation to each by means of the ordi- 
nary trial divisor.

120 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 



CHAPTER X. 

ANALYSIS OF EQUATIONS BY FOURIER'S THEOREM. 

178. The method of approximation explained in the pre- 
ceding chapter requires, as a necessary preliminary, that the 
situations of the roots have been ascertained by a previous 
analysis. Sturm's Method is, indeed, fully adequate to the 
analysis of any numerical equation, but is at the same time 
excessively laborious in its practical application. The object 
of the present chapter is to show how the necessary informa- 
tion regarding the roots may be obtained independently of 
Sturm's Theorem. 

179. Prop. I. — Fourier's Theorem.* 

Let f(x) = be an equation of the n th degree, then if a 
and 1), of 'which a < b, be successively substituted for x in 
the series of functions f(x), f (x), fz{x), f (x), consist- 
ing of f(x) and its successive derived functions, the excess 
in the number of variations of sign in the series when x = a. 
over the number when x = b, will not be less than the number 
of real roots of f(x) = that lie between a and b. 

By Art. 8, no change can take place in the sign of any of 
the above functions except when x increases through a value 
that makes that function vanish. 

It has already been proved (148, III.) that if a function f(x) 
vanish when x = c, then f(x) and its first derived function 
f (x) have contrary signs when x is indefinitely smaller than 
c, and the same sign when x is indefinitely greater than c. 
This relation must evidently hold good with regard to f (x) 



* The theorem is usually named after Fourier, though first published by Budan in 
1807. There is evidence, however, that Fourier had developed the theorem in MS. 
as early as 1797. 



FOURIER'S THEOREM. 127 

and its first derived function f 2 (x), and, generally, with regard 
to any function f r (x) and its first derived function / H i {x). 
We have two cases to consider : 

I. Suppose that for some value between a and b, as x = c, 

the r consecutive functions f(x), fi(x), f 2 (x), fr-i(%)> 

vanish, but f (x) does not. 

From what has been said above, these r + 1 functions will, 
when x is indefinitely smaller than c, present r variations of 
sign, and, when x is indefinitely greater than c, no variation. 

Hence, as x increases through a root c, that occurs r times 
in f(x) = 0, r variations of sign are lost in the series of 
functions, but none gamed. 

II. Suppose that when x = c the m derived functions 
f(x) to f r+m -i(x) vanish, but f-i(x) and f r+m (x) do not. 

Then in the series of m + 1 functions f r (x), f r+m _i(x), 

f r+m (x), there will be m variations of sign when x is in- 
definitely smaller than c, and f. (x) will have the same sign 
as f. +m (x) if m is an even number, and the contrary sign 
if m is an odd number. Therefore the series of m + 2 
functions, 

./Ufa), f{x), . • ..f r+m . X {x), f r+m (x), 

will, if the extreme functions, f-i(x) and f r+m (x), have the 
same sign, present m or m + 1 variations of sign (according 
as m is even or odd) when x is indefinitely smaller than c, 
and no variation when x is indefinitely greater than c ; while 
if f r -\(x) and f r+m (x) have contrary signs, there will be m +1 
or m variations (according as m is even or odd), when x is 
indefinitely smaller than c, and one variation, when x is in- 
definitely greater than c. 

Hence, as x increases through a value that makes m con- 
secutive derived functions vanish, m variations are lost when 
m is an even number, and m ± 1 when m is an odd number ; 
that is, the number of variations lost in this way is always an 
even number, and none is gained. 

Thus, as x increases from a to b, at least as many variations 
are lost (I.) as there are real roots in the interval ; also if there 
are more variations lost than there are real roots passed, the 
excess must be an even number (II.). 



128 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

180. Cor. 1. — If the coefficients of an equation f(x) = 0, 
present m more variations of sign than those of the trans- 
formed equation f (a + x') = 0, then the number of roots 
passed in the transformation is m, or m minus some even 
number. 

For the coefficients of f{x) are the values of the functions, 

g/. M. • • • • ]7/r (*). .... W (*), /i H /(*), 

when is put for a-, and the coefficients of /(« + #') are the 
values of the same functions when a is put for x. If, then, 
there are m variations fewer in the signs of the coefficients 
of f(a-\-x') as compared with those of f(x), this is the same 
as a loss of m variations in the signs of the series of functions 

/„ (x) . . . . f.(x) /(#), as x increases from to a, thus 

indicating m roots in the interval, or m minus some even 
number. 

181. Cor. 2. — If no variation is lost in the signs of the 
coefficients of a transformed equation, as compared with the 
preceding one, there is no root in the interval 

182. Cor. 3. — If any odd number of variations is lost, 
there is some odd number of roots in the interval; whether more 
than one, we cannot say. 

183. Cor. 4. — If any even number of variations is lost, 
there is either no root, or some even number of roots in the 
interval. 

184. Cor. 5. — If an equation have an odd number, p, 
of consecutive zero coefficients, these zeros indicate p ± 1 
imaginary roots, according as the zeros occur between similar 
or contrary signs ; if there be an even number, q, of consecu- 
tive zero coefficients, these, ivhethcr they occur between similar 
or contrary signs, indicate q imaginary roots. 

This follows from Art. 179, II ; for if we imagine the pro- 
posed equation transformed into another, having as roots those 
of the proposed each increased by an indefinitely small quantity, 
the zeros would be replaced by numbers having alternately 
positive and negative signs, while if the roots were diminished 



FOURIER'S THEOREM. 129 

by an indefinitely small quantity, the zeros would be replaced 
by numbers having the same sign, and, as by supposition, the 
zeros occur between terms that are not zero, variations have 
been lost that do not indicate real roots. 

185. General directions for the application of this theorem 
to the determination of the intervals in which positive roots 
may lie, may be given as follows : 

(1). Transform successively by 10, 100, 1000, &c, as far as 
necessary, so as to ascertain how many roots may be found in 
the intervals [0, 10], [10, 100], &c. This step may in many 
cases be omitted, as a cursory application of the rules for 
limits (75, 76) may show that there can be no root so great 
as 10, &c. 

(2). Proceed by successive transformations by 1 to find be- 
tween what units the roots in the interval [0, 10], if any, lie, 
singly or in groups ; for those in the interval [10, 100] we 
proceed by 10's; for those in the interval [100, 1000], by 100's. 

(3). Eoots found to lie singly between consecutive units, or 
tens, or hundreds, may be regarded as ready for the application 
of Horner's Method, since we have thus the leading figure of a 
root lying singly. But if more than one root is indicated be- 
tween consecutive tens, we proceed to subdivide the interval, 
by successive transformations by 1, till we find between what 
successive integers the roots lie singly or in pairs ; we proceed 
similarly when several roots are indicated between consecutive 
hundreds. 

186. By this process we are thus enabled either to obtain 
the initial figure of each root singly, or arrive at intervals of 
consecutive units between which two or more roots may lie. 
Proceeding, in this case, to develop the roots according to the 
precepts given in Art. 176, we may find : (1) by their separa- 
tion after a few figures, that the roots in question are real and 
unequal (see examples in 176) ; (2) by their continuing to 
concur to seven or more decimals, we may infer that the roots 
are equal, and proceed to verify the inference in the manner 
shown below ; (3) the roots are imaginary, of which we shall 
be made aware by tests presently to be explained. 



I HKil 



130 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

187. We shall illustrate each of these cases, taking for the 
first example the difficult equation, already given in Art. 158. 

Ex. 1. x 6 + 378Z 5 + 38189^ + 4923682? - 572554a* 

+ 213720a; — 26352 = 0. 

As it is evident by inspection that there is a root less than 
unity, we first transform by 1. In transforming by such num- 
bers as 1, 10, &c., there is no effective multiplication, and the 
easy additions and subtractions may be performed mentally, 
the results only being set down as in the following example : 

1 +378 +38189 +492368 —572554 +213720 — 26352 [_1_ 

379 +38568 +530936 — 41618 +172102 +145750' 

380 +38948 +569884 

We need pursue this transformation no further, as it is evi- 
dent that all the three variations of sign in the proposed 
equation will be lost ; we thus know that there is at least one 
real root in the interval [0,1], possibly three. 

To ascertain the intervals in which the negative roots may 
lie, we change the signs of alternate terms, and proceed first to 
transform by 10. 

1-378 + 38189-492368- 572554- 213720- 26352 [10 
-368 + 34509-147278-2045334-20667060-206696952' 
-358 + 30929 + 162012- 425214-24919200' 
-348 + 27449 + 436502-3939806' 
-338 + 24069 + 667192' 
-328 + 20789' 
-318' 

As the number of variations remains the same, we know 
that there is no root in the interval [0, —10]. As inspection 
of the transformed coefficients makes it probable that a further 
transformation by 10 will cause a change in the number of 
variations, we proceed : 

1-318 + 20789 + 677192-3939806-24919200-206696952 [10 
-308 + 17709 + 854282 + 4603014 + 21100940 + 4412448 

We need proceed no further with this transformation ; one 
variation is lost, and it is plain that no more can be lost, since 



FOURIER'S THEOREM. 131 

the second term, at least, will remain negative ; a root, there- 
fore, lies in the interval [—10, —20]. 

We now transform by 100, to ascertain whether more roots 
lie in the interval [0, —100]. 

1 -378 +38189 - 492368 - 572554 - 213720- 23652 [100 

-278+10389+ 546532+ 54080646+5407850880 + 540785061648' 
-178- 7411 - 194568 + 34623846 +8870235480' 
- 78 -15211 -1715668 -136942954' 
+ 22 -13011 -3016768' 
+ 122- 811' 
+ 222' 

Xo variations but the one due to the root in the interval 
[—10, —20] are lost by this transformation; no roots, there- 
fore, lie in the interval [—20, —100]. 

We proceed to a further transformation by 100 : 

1 + 222 - 811 -3016768 -136942954 + 8870235480 + 540785061648 [J00 
322 +31389 + 122132-124729754-3602739920 +180511069648 
422 +73589 +7481032 +623373446 + . . . . 

We perceive already that the two variations will be lost in 
this transformation, indicating the presence of two roots in the 
interval [—100, —200]. We can now, starting from the trans- 
formation by 100, transform repeatedly by 10, or, what is some- 
times preferable, halve the interval by transforming by 50. 
Proceeding in this manner, we find a variation is lost between 
the transformations by 160 and 170, then employing only the 
first line of transformations, we easily find the remaining root 
is situated between 190 and 200. We have thus ascertained 
the presence of single real roots in the intervals [—10, —20], 
[-160, -170], [-190, -200]. Of the three roots indicated 
in the interval [0, 1] we know that one, at least, must be real. 
As these roots are quite small as compared with the others, we 
may expect the trial expressions (^4) and (B) for three roots 
(175) to suggest the same leading figures, which they do, 

—37~ = .3 + and 49^ = .3 +. Proceeding by the 

aid of these trial divisors to develop the roots, as in the exam- 
ples in Art. 176, we find the three roots concur in the first 
four figures ; at the fourth transformation a discrepancy in the 



132 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

figures suggested by the two trial expressions warns us that 
the roots no longer concur. By the loss of one variation, 
when we try 1 as the trial figure, we find the root separated is 
the smallest of the three, the remaining two we find concur 
in one figure more, then separate, showing that they too are 
real. 



Ex. 2. W + 391^ + 5376z 3 - 2344a? + 336z — 16 = 0. 

7 + 391 + 5376 _ 2344 + 336— 16 [_1_ 
398 +5774 +3430 +3766 + 3750 

Before the completion of the first line of transformation it 
is apparent that all three variations of the proposed will be lost 
in the transformed equation, thus indicating three roots in the 
interval [0, 1]. To ascertain the situations of the remaining 
roots, we change the signs of alternate terms, and proceed 
thus :

449 +10376 +109124 +778176 

519 +15566 +264784 

It was evident before the completion of the second line of 
this transformation that all the coefficients would be positive, 



FOURIER'S THEOREM. 133 

the loss of two variations indicating two roots in the interval 
[—20, —30]. But, from a comparison of the final term of the 
last transformation with that of the preceding one, the roots 
would appear to lie much nearer to 30 than 20. It was there- 
fore worth while to complete the third line of the transforma- 
tion so as to obtain the coefficient C' 2 : we then find that 

~a\ 1, or ~tW~' = ~( 1 + )' and also i^tv = -(!+)' 

from which we infer that 30 is greater than both roots by 1 +, 
i. e., the roots lie in the interval [ — 28, — 29], which inference 
is verified by trial.* Thus the roots of the proposed equation 
lie, three in the interval [0, 1], two in [ — 28, — 29]. 

In Art. 17G the three roots in the interval [0, 1] we found 
to concur to three places of decimals, at the fourth figure one 
separating. The remaining two were found, even by the con- 
tracted process, to concur to seven places of decimals, a fact 
suggestive of the possibility of their being equal. 

Now, by Art. 95, if an equation have two incommensurable 
equal roots, it must have another pair, and be divisible by a 
quadratic factor having commensurable coefficients. If, there- 
fore, as in this example, besides the pair of roots supposed to 
be equal, another pair of roots is indicated in another interval, 
these, if the roots are really equal, must be, what may be 
termed, the conjugates of the supposed equal roots, and have 
their decimal parts the same, if the two pairs are of opposite 
signs, or complementary, if of the same sign ; also the product 
of a conjugate pair must be integral. Here we have the sup- 
posed equal roots each = . 1421356 . . ; the other pair, if the 
supposition is correct, must each = —28.1421356..; the 
sum of a pair of these, with changed sign, is 28, their product 
is — 4 approximatively. We try whether x 2 + 28a? — 4 will 
divide the first member of the equation ; as it does so, we know 
that there are two pairs of equal roots. 



* Whonevor, in the course of our search, we find a root, or roots, indicated in a 
certain interval, we may, as in this example, employ the coefficients of that trans- 
formation which has the smaller final term to guide us to the next figure, the sign of 
the suggested figure showing whether it is to he added to the smaller, or subtracted 
from the greater, of the numbers between which the roots are indicated. Even when 
the final terms show no decided difference, the numbers suggested will often be com- 
plementary, or nearly so, thus showing how far we may depend on them. 



134 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Similarly, if r roots a + S, where 6 is the decimal part, are 
found to concur to so many places of decimals as to render it 
probable that they are equal, and there is another interval con- 
taining 5 possibly equal roots with an integral part b, then if 
(a + <5) (# + <5) = c, an integer, approximative^, there is prima 
facie evidence that some of the roots are equal, in which case 
x 2 — (a-\-b)x + c* will divide the first member of the equation 
as many times as there are pairs of conjugate roots. 

Ex. 3. x 5 — x* — 15a; 3 — hx 2 + 53z + 51 = 0. 

We proceed as in the preceding examples to ascertain the 
interval in which roots may lie ; as the method of procedure 
has been sufficiently exemplified, we shall give merely the 
results.

It is evident that the remaining variation will disappear in 
the next transformation ; the positive roots are therefore real, 
and lie in the intervals [2, 3], [4, 5]. To find the places of 
the negative roots, we change the signs of alternate terms, and 
proceeding in the usual way, obtain the followiug results : 

[0]. 1 +1 —15 +5 +53 —51, three variations. 

[1]. 1+6—1 —24 +27 — 6, " 

[2]. 1 +11 +33 +19 +5 +3, no variation. 

AVe infer from the loss of three variations that there is, at 
least, one real root in the interval [— 1, —2], possibly three. 
The fact that two of the roots are imaginary is shown at once 
by the test we are about to establish. 

188. Def. — In Art. 66 it was shown that if C r be the 
coefficient of x r in an equation f(x) = 0, then 

C 2 - 2 C r+l • CU + 2 C r+2 • CU - ^ Ch-3 ' CU + &c,

be the coefficient of (x 2 ) r in F(x 2 ) = 0, the equation that has 
for roots the squares of the roots of f(x) = : this expres- 
sion, or its numerical value, we shall refer to as a coefficient 
fa net ion of f(x). 

189. Prop. II. — There are at least as many imaginary 
roots in an equation f(x) = as there are variations in the 
signs of its coefficient functions. 

For, since F(x 2 ) = must have as many positive real roots 
as f(x) = has real roots, the number of real roots in 
/ (.r) = cannot be greater than the number of variations of 
sign in F(x 2 ), and consequently the number of imaginary 
roots cannot be less than the number of permanences of sign 
in F(x 2 ). Now of the coefficient functions the first C 2 and. 
the last C 2 are always positive, so that the number of varia- 
tions in the signs of the whole series of functions must be an 
even number, if any, and indicate an equal number of perma- 
nences in the signs of F(x 2 ), since the values of these expres- 
sions, with the sign of each alternate one changed, are the 
coefficients of F(x 2 ) ; the number of imaginary roots in 
f(x) = cannot, therefore, be less than the number of varia- 
tions in the signs of the coefficient functions. 

190. Cor. — If the square of any coefficient C r be less than 
C r+ i'C r .i, the product of the contiguous coefficients, a pair of 
imaginary roots is thus indicated. 

If f(x) = C„x n + . . . C r+l x r+l +C r x r +C r - l xr- 1 +. . . C = 0, 
then the (r—l) th derived function, when divided by \ r— 1 , 

will have for its last three terms -±— -— l C r+l x 2 + rC,x + <?,._, ; 

)& 

there will be a pair of imaginary roots in f r -i(x) = 0, and 
therefore (88), in f(x) = 0, if r 2 C 2 < r{r+l)C r+l -Cr-i, or 

C 2 < r±l<7" .(*4 and, a fortiori, if C 2 < C r+1 'C r ^. 
r 

This corollary will often be found sufficient to determine the 

character of the roots in a doubtful interval ; in a nice case it 

r-fl 
may be important not to neglect the factor , especially 

when r is a small number. 



136 ALGEBKAICAL EQUATION'S. 

191. The test provided by the above proposition is so 
simple in its application that a glance at the coefficients of an 
equation will often suffice to show that some, if not all, of its 
roots are imaginary. 

Ex. 1. x 5 + z 4 + & — 2z 2 + 2z — 1 = 0. 

Here the coefficient functions, as found by the rule, are, 
1 — 1 +9 — 2 ±0 +1, four variations ; 
there are accordingly four imaginary roots in the equation. 

It is obviously not necessary to obtain the actual values as 
we have done in this example, the signs alone being important. 
The first and the last are always positive, and the rest are 
usually obvious to inspection. 

Ex. 2. x 1 — 2x 5 — Sx 3 + 4z 2 — 5x + 6 = 0. 

When, as in this example, the equation is not complete, we 
must supply the place of the absent terms by zeros before 
proceeding to determine the signs of the coefficient functions. 

We here obtain the 'series of signs, + H f- H h> 

and see that there are at least four imaginary roots. 

Ex. 3. 5x G - ldx 5 + 43z* — 75z 3 + 438^-412^ + 253 = 0. 

From this we obtain the series of signs, H 1 1 \-, 

and see that the roots are all imaginary. 

In the last example of Art. 187 we arrived at a transforma- 
tion, 

1 +11 +33 +19 +5 +3, 

where two variations had been lost, the corollary above given 
shows that the two roots in the interval are imaginary since 
5 2 < 19 x 3, thus completing the analysis of the equation. 
Having showed that variations in the signs of the coefficient 
functions indicate imaginary roots, we have now to prove the 
converse of that proposition. 

192. Prop. III. — If an equation f(x) =: have a pair 
of imaginary roots a ± j3\/— 1, there are certain limit* 
/I and n, one less than a, the other greater, such that, if the 
equation be transformed to f(y-\-x')—{), where y is any 



TESTS FOR IMAGINARY ROOTS. 137 

real quantity between X and [*,* one at least of the coefficient 
functions icill be negative. 

(1). If f{x) = be transformed into /(« + #') = 0, in the 
latter equation the roots a ± [3 V— 1 will be reduced to 
±j3\/ — 1, which roots in F\a-\-x'j = will become a 
pair of negative real roots, — (3% — /3 2 . These (53) must pro- 
duce a pair of permanences in the signs of the coefficients of 
F(a-\- x' z ), corresponding to which must be a pair of varia- 
tions in the signs of the coefficient functions of f(a + x'). Hence 
there is a transformed equation which has at least one negative 
function corresponding to the supposed pair of imaginary roots. 

(2). Supposing f(x) to be of the n th degree, then 
Forming the coefficient functions according to 188, we have 



-sfttjiUjr) ; ■ • • • UAy)J-My)f(y) ; 



U(y)Y- 

Of these functions, which are all of even degree, the first 
and last cannot be negative, and of the rest none can become 
negative if all the roots of f(x) = are real (189). But, 
if f(x) = have a pair of imaginary roots a ± (3 V— h 
it has been proved that some one of these functions, say [/i(y)] 2 
— fz(y)f(y), becomes negative, at least when y = a. This 
function must therefore become zero for some value of y 
greater than a, as \i, and also, being of even degree, for some 
value A, less than a. Thus, if the roots of f(x) =0 be 
diminished by any quantity between X and \x, at least one of 
the series of coefficient functions in the transformed equation 
will be negative. 

193. We say, at least one, for several consecutive functions 
may be negative for the same value of y, and these, in like 
manner, continue negative for values of y between other limits 

* The signs of these limits may of course he different, and one of the admissible 
values of y he 0, as in the examples in Art. 191. 



138 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

[A', jit'], &c. If these negative functions were not consecutive, 
there would be more than one pair of variations, and therefore 
more than one pair of imaginary roots indicated. 

194. By considering the subject in the following manner, 
we obtain some insight into the relations existing between the 
limits [A, fi] and the roots a ± V— 1. 

Corresponding to a pair of roots a ± j3 V— 1 in f(x) = 
is a factor x 2 — lax + (a 2 -f /3 2 ) in f(x), and a factor 
& _ 2 (a 2 _ (3 2 )x 2 + (a 2 + 2 ) 2 in F(x 2 ). 

As long as a' 2 > (3 2 (where a' = a — y), the real part of the 



imaginary roots (a'±(3y — l) 2 in F(y + x' ) = remains 
positive; but, since as y increases in f(y -\-x') = 0, a' be- 
comes smaller while (3 remains constant, a' 2 —l3 2 first becomes 
negative ; and, when y = x, the factor in F(y + x' 2 ) = 
becomes x* -f 2(3 2 2; 2 + j3 4 , representing, as we have seen, a pair 
of real negative roots. As y still increases, a' 2 , after passing 
through zero, increases till it again reaches a value at which 
the coefficient — 2 (a' 2 — (3 2 ) no longer causes permanences in 
the signs of F(y-\-x' 2 ). Thus, as — 2 (a' 2 — ft 2 ) is positive 
only when a' has a value between + (3 and — (3, it would 
appear that the difference between A and \i must generally 
be somewhat less than 20, or A and \i lie between a — (3 
and a + (3. 

Or, suppose F(y+~x~' 2 ) = <p{z 2 )[z*-2(a' 2 -(3 2 )z 2 + (a' 2 + (3 2 ) 2 ,] 
where z = y + #', and $(2 2 ) is the function involving the 
squares of the real roots, and of those imaginary roots within 
whose limits we shall first suppose y does not here fall. The 
signs of (p(z 2 ) will present a series of variations, say, 

+ - + - + - + -+. 
Now, if in the factor z* - 2 {a' 2 - (3 2 )z 2 + (a' 2 + /3 2 ) 2 , we 
have a' 2 = (3 2 , the series of signs in that factor will be 
4- +, and the multiplication by that factor will merely 
add two variations to those of (p(z 2 ), since like signs will come 
under like : thus in this case y = a ± (3 does not fall within 
the limits of a-±(3\/— 1. But if the signs of <f)(z 2 ) do 
present a pair of permanences, let the series of signs be, 

+ - + - + - + + +, 



FOURIER'S THEOREM. 139 

then the multiplication by the factor presenting the series of 

signs + -f will produce the series H 1 1 h ± + + + > 

which may have four permanences: thus y = a ±/3 may fall 
within the limits of the roots a ± j3a/ — 1, if at the same 
time it be within the limits of another pair of imaginary 
roots. 

195. Hence, if there be two pairs of imaginary roots, 
a ± fiV — 1 and y ± 6 V— 1, then of the four quantities, 
a-ft a + ft y-d, y -f d, (1) if a + [3 = or < y-d, the 
two pairs of roots will indicate their presence by producing 
pairs of variations in the signs of the coefficient functions of 
different transformations : (2) if both a — (3 and a-f/3 lie 
between y — 6 and y -f- 6, the two pairs of roots will indicate 
their presence by four variations in the coefficient functions 
of some one transformation ; this includes the cases where 
a = y, whether (3 = d or not : (3) if a -f- j3 lies be- 
tween y — (5 and y + d, the two pairs of roots may or 
may not give indication of their presence in the same trans- 
formation. 

196. If the difference between X and \i be not less than 
unity, whenever, indeed, A and \i do not both lie between 
consecutive integers, the character of imaginary roots is easily 
determined. For when in the course of our transformations 
to discover in what intervals roots may lie, we have narrowed 
down a doubtful interval to between two consecutive integers, 
one or other of these integers must, in the supposed case, fall 
between the limits, and one or other of the transformations 
have a negative coefficient function.* We shall first illustrate 
this, the more common case, by a few examples, leaving the 
more difficult cases for future consideration. 



* The ftinction If Ay)] 2 -fMfiy) equated to zero, or <p(y) = 0, of which X and ft 
are roots, may he regarded as a limiting equation to the real parts of imaginary roots 
of fix) = 0, just as/^aj) = is to the real roots. The first derived function of 
<p{y) equated to zero, or My)f,{y) -f 3 (y)f(y) = 0, must have a real root between 
X and /i. We could, therefore, if there were not easier methods, always thus deter- 
mine a value of y which would make f(y + x') present variations in the signs of its 
coefficient functions, if the roots in the doubtful interval are imaginary. 



140 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Ex. 1. Let the equation proposed for analysis be, 

4Z 5 — 28a 4 — 39a 8 + 504z 2 — 239a; — 1855 = 0. 

We see that there is probably no root greater than 10 ; 
we therefore, transforming successively by 1, obtain the follow- 
ing results :

three variations. 



one variation. 



Here two variations are lost, and since obviously 12 7 2 
< 184 x 315, the roots indicated are imaginary. The re- 
maining positive root must be real, and its interval [5, 6] is 
found by finding what number will make the final term 
positive. 

To find the intervals of the negative roots, we change the 
signs of alternate terms, and transforming successively by 1, 
obtain the following results : 

[0]. 4+28 — 39 —504 — 239 +1855; two variations. 

[1]. 4 +48 +113 —413 —1232 +1105; " 

[2]. 4 +68 +345 +254 -1507 - 375; one variation. 

The loss of a variation here shows that the negative roots 
are real, and one lies in the interval [—1, —2]. The remain- 
ing root is found, as above, to lie in the interval [—3, — 4]. 
The proposed equation has therefore three real roots lying 
in the intervals [—3,-4], [ — 1,-2], and [5, 6], and two 
imaginary roots, the real part of which is not far from 4. 

Ex. 2. Let the equation proposed for analysis be, 
x g _ 6%5 + 40a? + (3(^2 _ x _ i _ . 

Proceeding as above, we obtain the results : 

[0]. 1 — 6 + +40 + 60 — 1 - 1; three var. 

[1]. 1 + -15 + +135 +215 + 93; two var. 

[v]. i + 6 + —40 + 60 +431 +429; " " 

[3]. 1 +12 +45 +40 + 15 +467 +887; no var. 



FOURIER'S THEOREM. 141 

The loss of a variation indicated a real root in the interval 
[0, 1] ; the loss of two variations in the interval [2, 3] leads 
us to apply the test for imaginary roots, and as, obviously, 
15 < 40 x 407, the roots indicated are imaginary. To find 
the negative roots, changing alternate signs, we have : 

[0]. 1 + 6 + —40 +G0 + 1 - 1; three variations. 
[1]. 1 +12 +51 +68 + 63 +73 +37; no variation. 

Here three roots are indicated in the interval [0, —1], of 
which one must be real ; but, since 03 2 < 68 x 73, the other 
two must be imaginary. The equation, therefore, has but two 
real roots, one in each of the intervals [ — 1, 0], [0, 1]. 

197. In the preceding examples the presence of imaginary 
roots, where they occur, has been detected with facility, as will 
always be the case except when (3, the coefficient of the imagi- 
nary sign, is so small that the limits [A, ii\ fall between con- 
secutive integers. 

When we arrive at a doubtful interval between two consecu- 
tive integers,* that is, one where the coefficients of neither 
transformation give indications of imaginary roots, the roots 
in the interval may be (1) real roots, equal or nearly equal, in 
which case we can, as shown in (187), by the aid of the proper 
trial expressions, determine them to any degree of accuracy 
desired ; (2) the roots, or some even number of them, may be 
imaginar} r , having (3 small. Now the smaller (3 is, the more 
closely do the imaginary roots approach to being equal real 
roots, and the proper trial expressions will guide to successive 
figures of the real part of the roots, till a discrepancy in the 
suggested figures warns us that either a group of roots is 
about to separate, or that we have come within the narrow 
limits where the coefficient functions give indications of the 
roots being imaginary. In the case of a doubtful interval, 
therefore, we proceed according to the rules in Art. 176, and 
when a discrepancy in the trial expressions occurs, apply the 
test for imaginary roots. 

* One of which, obviously, mast he within .5 of the roots, or real part of the 
imaginary roots. 



142 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Ex. 1. Let the proposed equation be, 
4a;7 _ q x g _ 7^5 + gz 4 + 7^ — 23a: 2 — 22a; — 5 = 0. 

[0]. 4-6-7 + 8 + 7 -23 -22 - 5; three yar. 
[1]. 4 +22 +41 +23 -11 -30 -58 -44; one yar. 

Here two variations are lost ; and since 30 2 < 2(11 x 58 
+ 23 x 44), the roots indicated are imaginary. The remain- 
ing positive root is of course real, and its situation is easily 
found. 

To find the negative roots, changing the signs of alternate 
terms, and proceeding as usual, we obtain, 

[0]. 4 + 6— 7— 8+ 7 + 23 —22 +5; four var. 
[1]. 4+34 +113 +187 +165 +100 +42 +8; no var. 

Here are four variations lost, and since 165 2 < 2(187 x 100 

— 113 x 42), two at least of the roots must be imaginary. 

Whether the other two are so, evidently depends upon whether 

the real root of f x (x) = in the interval separates them. 

a 5 x2 4K -, 22 

As -q5- = .4o. ., and — — - = .47. ., we may expect the 

roots, if real, to coincide in the two figures .46 at least; 
proceeding in the approximation, we find the roots agree in 
the four figures .4616, and separate at the fifth figure; these 
roots are therefore real. 

Ex. 2. Let the proposed equation be, 

a* _ 91^4 + 2518a; 3 + 17870a; 2 + 4617a; — 82580 = 0. 

Transforming several times by 10, we obtain, 

[0]. 1-91+2518 + 17870+ 4617- 82580; three var. 

[10]. 1—41- 122 + 48810+ 803417+ 3458590; two var 

[20]. 1+9— 762 + 30550 + 1629017 + 15941760; " " 

[30]. 1+59+ 598 + 23090 + 2107417 + 34814930; no var. 

By the loss of a variation in the interval [0, 10] a real root 
is there indicated ; the loss of two variations in the interval 
[20, 30] indicates two roots, which, without subdividing the 
interval, we see must be imaginary, since 598 2 < 23090 x 59. 



FOURIER'S THEOREM. 143 

To find the situations of the negative roots, we change 
alternate signs, and, seeing that 8 is a superior limit, we 
transform several times by 1 ; thus we obtain, 

[0]. 1 + 91 +2518 -17870 + 4617 +82580 

[1]. 1 + 96 +2892 — 9760 —23200 +71937

[3]. 1 +106 +3700 + 9976 -24384 +11201 

[4]. 1 +111 +4134 +21722 + 7097 + 600 



two var 



no var. 



The roots indicated in the interval [3, 4] may be real, as 
neither transformation has a negative coefficient function. 
The roots, if real, are evidently nearer to 4 than 3 ; as both 

~ 600x2 and ~ 7097 suggest - .16. ., we infer that the 

7097 21722x2 ^ 

roots are not far from 3.83... We accordingly, proceeding 
from the transformation by 3, transform first by . 8, and again 
by .03, though there is a slight discrepancy in the figures 
suggested by the trial expressions of the transformation by . 8, 
the one suggesting .03.., the other .028... We obtain as 
the three right-hand terms in this transformation 19632.7. ., 
67.76.., 1.058.., and as obviously 67T7 3 < 19632x2, the 
roots indicated are imaginary, the real part being not far from 
3.83.., and the imaginary part less than . 05 V— 1. 

Ex. 3. In the equation, 
^ + 1755^ + 270450^+14262750^-17791875^ + 5484376=0, 

two variations are lost in the interval [0, 1], Here the trial

J. { ( J -L4:/iO X <v 

ing with the approximation, as on the following page, we find 
the same figures suggested by both expressions in each trans- 
formation, till we have obtained .6129. At the fourth trans- 
formation the trial expressions suggest widely different figures, 
and as obviously 2198 2 < 108168 x 147 x 2, the roots are 
imaginary, having the real part about . 6129, and the imag- 
inary part about . 0001 V— 1. 

198. When the imaginary part is very small, as in this 
example, we evidently cannot obtain evidence of the imaginary

FOURIER'S THEOREM. 145 

character of the roots till we have carried out the approxima- 
tion to so many decimals as will make the real part a less 
than (3, the coefficient of V— 1. Yet the labor of ascertain- 
ing that a pair of roots is imaginary with a very small imag- 
inary part is by no means lost. It is of great importance 
to recognize such roots, as we thus see that a very slight 
change in the final coefficient, or in the conditions of the 
problem that led to the equation, would change these imag- 
inary roots into equal, or nearly equal, real roots. The longer 
the recognition of their imaginary character is delayed, the 
nearer do the imaginary roots approach to being real roots, 
and the more reason is there to revise the data in accordance 
with which the equation was framed. Thus, in the cubic 
equation, x s — nx — 2.143257 == 0, if we employ the ordi- 
nary approximation rr = 3.1416, we obtain three real roots, 
two nearly equal : but if we employ the closer approximation 
rr z= 3.14159, we obtain only one real root, the other two 
being imaginary with (3 comparatively small. 

199. In point of facility, the method of analysis here pro- 
posed presents obvious advantages over that of Sturm. In the 
latter method the difficulty of the analysis may be said to 
increase in geometrical ratio with the degree of the equation, 
and the calculation of the functions is equally operose, whether 
the roots, from their close proximity, are difficult of separa- 
tion, or the reverse. In the method here recommended the 
labor of analysis may be said to increase only in arithmetical 
progression with the degree of the equation, and is, compara- 
tively, but little affected by the magnitude of the coefficients ; 
and the recognition of the character of the roots in a given 
interval is delayed only in proportion to the smallness of the 
quantity (real or imaginary) by which these roots differ. 
There is here no essential difference between the analysis and 
the solution of an equation, both being effected by one uni- 
form process consisting of a series of transformations by 
Horner's Method, in which we first, by transforming over 
wider intervals, ascertain, by the rules established by Fourier's 
Theorem, in what intervals roots may lie ; then, by trans- 
forming over narrower intervals, assisted by the trial divisors 



14G ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

(176), we either succeed in separating the roots, or find by 
the criterion established in (189) that certain roots are imag- 
inary. 

200. The calculation of imaginary roots may, theoretically, 
be effected by transforming, by methods given in Chap. XII, 
the equation in which they occur into others in which the real 
parts, a and (3, occur separately as real roots, which may then 
be obtained by methods already given. Practically, however, 
when more than one, or at most two, pairs of imaginary roots 
occur in an equation, their calculation is very laborious. For 
some of the methods for determining such roots see Art. 
212-215.

CUBIC EQUATIONS. 147 



CHAPTER XI. 

CUBIC EQUATIONS. 

201. A cubic equation, being of odd degree, has always 
a real root of sign contrary to that of the final term (11) ; the 
leading figure of a root of a cubic can thus be always ascer- 
tained by trying which is the least number that will cause the 
final term to change sign. Then, having calculated the root 
to which this number is an immediately superior limit, we can 
in various ways determine the remaining roots. This manner 
of proceeding may, however, under certain circumstances 
prove more laborious than is necessary, and the determination 
of the remaining roots is not so easily effected as in the 
method of procedure about to be explained, by which the ten- 
tative character of the usual method is avoided, and the roots 
obtained with a minimum of calculation. 

202. As in Art. 122, let the roots x u % 2 , %s, of x? + qx 
-j- r = 0, be 2a, — (a-f-/3), ( — a— /3), in order of numerical 
value, and, as before, writing the coefficients in terms of the 
roots, we have, 

tf _ ( 3a 2 + (J2) x _ (2 a 2 — 2a/32) = 0. 

Hence 3a 2 + (3* = — q ; 

4a 2 = — q, when [3 = a, ?. e., when one root is in- 

definitely small, 
and 2a = V—q, the smallest possible value of x lf 

the sign of V— q being taken contrary to 
that of r. 
Again, as 3a 2 + (3 2 = — q, 

3a 2 = — q, when = 0, i. e., when there are 
two equal roots, 
and 2a = V—§q, the greatest possible value of % lf 

when the roots are all real. 



148 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Again, as 3a 2 -f/3 2 = — q, 

3a 2 — y 2 = — q, when (3 = y V— 1? i- e., when there 
are two imaginary roots, 
and 2a > V — iq, since 3a 2 > — q. In this last 

case, if y 2 = or > 3a 2 , then q is zero or positive, and we see 
by inspection that there are imaginary roots. 

Hence, if all the roots are real, the numerically greatest 
must lie between the limits V — q and V—£q, with the sign 
of — r; also, since the superior limit V — \q is equal to the 
inferior limit V-^ q multiplied by Vf, which equals V-ft* 
or -J nearly, the inferior limit differs from the superior by less 
than \ of the latter. Therefore, if we add one-third of itself 
to — q, the leading figure of the square root of the sum will 
be either the first figure of x x , or may be a unit too great,* 
if the roots are all real. 

203. Again, since 

— r = 2a 3 — 2a/3 2 , 



.-. v — 4r = v 8a 3 — 8a(5 2 < 2a when (3 is real, 

= 2a when j3 = 0, 
> 2a when = yV— 1. 

Comparing these with the results of the preceding article, 
we find that V — iq >? =, or < fy — 4r, according as the 
roots are all real and unequal, there are two equal roots, or 
there are two imaginary roots, so that in every case x x lies 
between V— %q and V— 4r, both having the sign of the 
latter. We are now prepared to state the following rule : 

Given an equation z 3 + qx + r = 0, where q is negative, 
ive determine by inspection the leading figures of V—j?q and 
V—4:r, talcing loth with the sign of the latter, then (1), if the 
first figure thus found is greater than the second, the roots 
are all real and unequal and the first figure is either the 
leading figure of x x or may be a unit too great ; (2), if the 
first figure is less than the second, there are two imaginary 

* In comparatively rare cases the leading fignre of V— $ Q may be greater than 
the leading fignre of x x by two units, as when — q is close on a square number, and 
at the same time the equation has one root very small as compared with the others. 



CUBIC EQUATIONS. 149 

roots, and the leading figure of x x is not greater than the lead- 
ing figure of V— 4r; (3), if both figures are equal, we have 
in each the leading figure of x lf but the remaining roots are 
doubtful. See foot of page 59. 

Ex. 1. a« — 51a — 62 = 0. 

Here, adding one-third of itself to 51 we have 68, and 
62 x 4 = 248 ; we see by inspection that v 68 = 8 + and 
a/288 = 6 -f, the roots are therefore all real and unequal, 
and the leading figure of x x is 8 or 7. 

Ex. 2. z 3 — 6ox -f 316 = 0. 

Here V— $q = — 9 + , and \/—4=r = — 10 -f, there are 
therefore two imaginary roots, and the leading figure of x x is 
— 10, or — 9. 

Ex. 3. x^ - 2778z - 56429 = 0. 

Here V— $q = 60 +, and fy — 4r = 60 -f, the leading 
figure of X\ is certainly 60 ; the remaining roots are doubtful. 
If it is desirable to ascertain their character without solving 
the equation, this may easily be effected by comparing 27r 2 
and 4^ 3 . 

204. We are in this way able to determine the leading 
figure of Xi within very narrow limits. This root is also the 
most convenient for calculation, as there is no other of the 
same sign ; it also differs from the others by 3a ±(3, that is, 
by at least its own value, so that the trial divisors will be 
found quite as effective in guidipg us to the second and suc- 
ceeding figures of the root as they are in the operation for the 
cube root, which, as before mentioned, is but the solution of a 
cubic of the form x 3 -f- r = 0. 

205. When x x has been found, we may, if it is commen- 
surable, depress the equation to a quadratic and thus find 
x 2 , x-3. In few cases, however, will the root be commensur- 
able ; it will therefore be found most convenient, after approxi- 
mating to Xi to six or seven decimals, to calculate the remain- 
ing roots by one of the formulas deduced as follows : 



150 ALGEBKAICAL EQUATIONS. 



Since 3a 2 + /3 2 = — q, .-. (3 = ± V— q — 3a 2 , hence 



-(a±j3) = -^ ± V-q-ix 1 \ 
Or, since 2a (a 2 — /3 s ) = — r, and 3a 2 -fj3 2 = —q, we obtain 

= # 2 or afc. 

Ex. 1. z 3 — 7x — 7 = 0. 

Here adding one-third of itself to 7, and multiplying 7 by 4, 
we obtain 9+ and 28, the square root of the first and the 
cube root of the second both begin with 3, which must there- 
fore be the leading figure of x x . For comparison we place, on 
the following page, side by side, the approximation to x x of 
this equation, and the extraction of the cube root of 28.342421, 
which is the cube of Xi . 

It will be observed that some modifications have been intro- 
duced into the process for the calculation of x l} which is thus 
rendered strictly analogous to that usually employed for the 
extraction of the cube root. Thus, after completing the right- 
hand column by the addition of three ciphers,* we complete 
the second column by adding the square of the figure last 
found to the two rows of figures above, and then appending 
two ciphers; the left-hand column we complete by adding 
twice the figure last found, and append one cipher. The 
contraction is performed as usual, according to the rules 
in (170). 

To find the roots j& 2 > x s> we shall employ the second for- 
mula, thus, 



x 2 and x z = -i(3. 0489173 ± \Z', 



21 



3.0489173

a* — 25z + 148 = 0. 



Here 25 xf = 33+, and — 148 x4 = —502 ; the square 
root of the first is — 5 +, the cube root of the second is 
— 8 -f- ; there are therefore imaginary roots, and Cardan's 
Formula could be employed to find x x . It is obvious, however, 
that the compact process above exemplified will give the root 
with much less numerical labor. The leading figure of x Y 
must lie between — 5 and — 8 ; upon trial, it is found to be 
6, we then proceed as follows, first changing the sign of the 
final term, so as to make x x positive :

-==- + 1 is a superior limit ; the root proves to be 2 . 82 . . .

Ex. 5. a? — 11a? - 102a; — 181 = 0. 

In order to make the second coefficient divisible by 3, we 
multiply the roots by 3 (59) ; we thus obtain, 

y s _ 33?/2 _ 918?/ - 4887 = 0. 

We proceed to diminish the roots by 11, and obtain, 

z* + — 12812 — 17647 = 0. 

As V1281 x i and ^17647 x 4 both begin with 40, we 
proceed to calculate z x with 40 as leading figure and obtain

Adding 11 to each of these roots, and dividing by 3, we

CHAPTEE XII. 

SYMMETRICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE ROOTS. 

206. A symmetrical function of the roots of an equation 
is an expression in which the roots are similarly involved, so 
that the function is not altered if any of the roots be inter- 
changed. Thus the coefficients of an equation are symmetrical 
functions of the roots, since (45) in the equation 

z n + C^x"- 1 + C n . 2 x n ~ 2 + . . . . CyX + <7 = 

— CU = «i + 02 + «3 + a n, 

C n _ 2 r= 0102 -T- 0103 + 0203 + 0«-10«> 

— CU = 0i0 2 3 + 010 2 04 + 0«-2 0»-10«, 

and so on. These are symmetrical functions ; since however 
we may interchange the roots, the function is not altered. 
We propose in the present chapter to show that by means of 
the above elementary functions, given by the coefficients of 
the equation, we can obtain any rational symmetrical function 
of the roots of an equation in terms of its coefficients. 

20*7. A function, 

01" 1 + 02™ + 03 m + • • • • 0n m , 

in which each term involves only one of the roots, is said to be 
of the first order. 
A function, 

a l m a 2 p + 0! m 3 p + a 2 m a^ + . . . . n _i w 0^. ., 

which contains every permutation of the roots taken two at a 
time, with m as the exponent of the first and p of the second, 
is said to be of the second order, and is usually denoted by 
2 cii m a 2 p , as being the sum of all the terms that can be formed 
like ai m a 2 p . 



156 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

A function, 

aFctfa-f + a x m (h*a£ + a-Fa^af + ...., 

which contains every permutation of the roots taken three at 
a time, with m as the exponent of the first, p of the second, 
and q as the third, is said to be of the third order, and is 
denoted by I>ai m a 2 p a^ q . For functions of the fourth and 
higher orders symbols of similar form may be employed. 

The function of the first order, which is the sum of the m th 
powers of the roots, might in like manner be denoted by 
2 « x m , but is usually denoted simply by S m , as in the following 
proposition containing Newton's Theorem for obtaining the 
functions of the first order. 

208. To express the sum of the mP 1 powers of the roots in 
terms of the coefficients and inferior poivers. 

Let «i, a 2 , «3, . . . . a n denote the roots of the equation 

f(x) = x n + CUz"" 1 + C n . 2 x n ~ 2 + . . . . . dx + C = 0, 

also Si = cii + a 2 + a% + a n > 

S 2 = ai 2 + a 2 2 + ag + a 2 , 

S m = a{ n + a 2 m + a 3 m + fl*". 

By Art. 92 we have 

J v J x — di x — a 2 x — a n 

Each of the divisions here indicated can be performed ex- 
actly by Art. 1 9, the quotient being the equation depressed by 
division by one of its binomial factors ; thus we have, 

£&- = ar 1 + (a, + C n -i)x- 2 + («i 2 + CU «, + C n Jx** +....

with similar results for y ' v ; ,' y , &c.

SYMMETRICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE ROOTS. 157 

Hence, by the addition of these n quotients, we have 
/, (x) = nx^ + (S l + nC n . l )x»->+ (S 2 + C ll _ l S 1 + nC n - 2 )x»-*+ . . . 

But, by Art. 7, we have also, 

f\(x) = nx n ~ l + (n—l)C n _iX n - 2 + (n—2)C„- 2 x n - 3 + .... 

+ (n—m)C H _ m x n - m - l -\- 

Equating the coefficients of corresponding terms in these 
identical expressions, we have, 

^ + fiCLi = (n— 1)CU, or Si + C„-i = 0. 

S 2 + CUft + »0^ = (>?-2)6U, or £+CU#+20U = 0. 

4 + CU&+CUft+»CL* = (»-3)CL», or 

Ss + CL, & + C n _ 2 Si + 3 cu = o. 

# m 4- C„-A-i+ CUA-2+ • • ^-,-i^+wC,,, = (n-m)C n . m , or 
4 + ^-1^-1+^.2^.2+ . . C n _ m _iSi + mC n _ m = 0. 

This last formula gives S m , the sum of the m th powers of 
the roots, in terms of the coefficients and inferior powers of 
the roots. Thus having S i9 we can find S 2 , and then S 3 , and 
so on, till we reach S mf where m is less than n. 

The process may be extended so as to obtain S m , where m 
is not less than n, as follows : 

Multiplying the given equation by x m ~ n , we have 

x m + C n -iX m - 1 + C n . 2 x m ~ 2 + C x m -" — 0. 

In this substituting in succession « l3 a 2 , a 3 , . . . . a n , for x, 
and adding the results, we obtain 

Sm + ^'n-l S m -\ + ^«-2 S,n-2 + • • • • ^0 £>m-n • 

Hence, making m = ?i, n + 1, w + 2, &c, in succession, 
we find, observing that S = «/> + a 2 ° + . . . . a H ° = w, 

«, + 0.-1 &-, + 0,-3 S.-2 + .... fid = 0, 

S n +1 + Cn-1 #i + C«-2 $n-l + Co /Si = 0, 

and so on till we obtain S m , where m may be of any magni- 
tude. 



158 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

Ex. To find S 6 , the sum of the sixth powers of the roots of 
a* — 2s 3 — 5z 2 + 7a — 3 = 0. 

Here - C s = 2, - <7 2 = 5, - Q = — 7, — G = 3. 

#i = — C 3 = 2. 

# = - <7 3 #i - 2C 2 = 4 + 10 = 14. 

# 3 = - C 3 S 2 - C 2 S l - 3C\ = 28 + 10 - 21 = 17. 

St = -ftfl s -Q& — ft/Si— 4Co = 34 + 70-14 + 12 = 102. 

# 5 = _C 3 ^-C f 2 ^3-C 1 ^ 2 -C ^ 1 = 204 + 85-98 + 6 = 197. 

S 6 = - C / 3 ^5-C2/S'4-C 1 /S'3-(7o/S r 2 =394 + 510-119 + 42 = 827. 

Thus the sum of the sixth powers of the roots is 827 ; the 

sums of higher powers can be found by continuing the process. 

To find the sums of the negative powers of the roots we put 

— for x, that is, transform the equation into the .equation 

involving the reciprocals of the roots (64), and apply the for- 
mulae as above. 

209. A very convenient process for finding the sums of 
the powers of the roots may be deduced as follows : 

Since /!(.) = £&- + l&L + I®- + .... 
x — a x x — 02 x — a$ 

a . m X A (s) _ x , a , «? , 
f{x) ~ x — cii x — a-2 x — Oz 

=(-r + (i-r+(-r+- 

= n + S 1 ar 1 + 8zar*+ S 3 x~ s + . . . . 

That is, if we multiply f x (x) by x, and divide by f(x) the 
coefiicients of the quotient will be in their order S , Si, S 2 , 

S m . Thus, in the example of the preceding article, if we 

divide 4^ 4 — 6z 3 — lOz 2 + Ix by x* — 2^ 3 — 5x 2 +7^ — 3, 
we obtain in succession, as the coefiicients of the quotient, 
4, 2, 14, 17, 102, &c. 

210. From the equations in (208), expressing the sums of 
the powers of the roots in terms of the coefiicients, we can 
obtain expressions for the coefficients in terms of Si, S 2 , S 3 , 
&c. ; thus, 



SYMMETRICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE ROOTS. 159 

ft-i = -ft, 

(7 /( . 3 = - i (* + Gm & + C n _ 2 ft), 

CU = - £ (& + ft* ft.! + . . . . c n _ r _ 2 s,). 

211. ^4m/ rational symmetrical function of the roots of an 
equation can lc expressed in terms of the coefficients and 
functions of lower order. 

First, to find the value of 2ata 2 p , the function of the sec- 
ond order. 

Since ft,, = at + a 2 m + at + at + 

ft, = af + af + af + af +.... 

by multiplication we obtain, 

S m ft = at +p + a 2 m+p + a 3 m+ * + « 4 wl+ * + . . . . 

+ «tf» a 2 * + at a 3 p + ffi™ af + a 2 m «s p + • • • . 
that is, 

ft, ft = S m+P + 2 at a 2 p , or 2 Bl - a 2 * = ft, ft, - S m+P . [1]. 

Next, to find the value of 2ata 2 p a s q , the function of the 
third order, we multiply together the equations 

Zataf = ata 2 p + at af + at at + a 2 m af + .... 
ft = a? + af + a£ + af +-... 

and obtain a result consisting of three partial products : 

(1) the sum of the products of the form 

af +q af — Zat +q a 2 p , 

(2) the sum of the products of the form 

at +q a 2 ,n = 2at +9 a 2 m , 

(3) the sum of the products of the form 

at a fag = lata-faf; 
thus, 

ft x lataf = Zat +q af + Zat +q a 2 m + ^atafag. 

Substituting for lataf, Zat +q af, and laf^a-t their 
values obtained by formula [1], we have 

2 at<h v a<£ = S m ft ft — S m+q ft — S p+q S m + %S m+p+q . [2]. 



160 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

By proceeding in a similar manner we can obtain formula? 
for functions of the fourth and higher orders expressed in 
terms of the sums of the powers of the roots ; and as these 
(208) can be expressed by integral functions of the coefficients, 

any rational symmetrical function la{ n a 2 p a m r can be 

expressed by integral functions of the coefficients. 

These are called the elementary symmetrical functions; 
and, as it is by the combination of these that every complex, 
rational, and symmetrical function is formed, it follows that 
the value of every rational symmetrical function of the roots 
can be expressed by the coefficients of the equation. 

212. The formulae obtained above, where the exponents 
m, p, q, &c, were assumed to be unequal, must be modified 
if we suppose any of the exponents to be equal. Thus, if 
m = p in the formula 

lafaf = S m S p — S m+p , 

since then a{*a 2 p = a x p a 2 m , the terms in 1 (ii m a 2 p become equal, 
two and two, and 2ai m a 2 p becomes 22(a 1 a 2 ) ni , therefore, in 
this case, 

2a 1 m a 2 m = i(SJ-S 2m ). 

Similarly, if, in Za^a^a^, m = p, we have 

2 K <h) m <h q = i (SJ S q - S 2m S q - 2S m+q S m + ^S 2m+q ) ; 

and if m = p = q, I>a ] m a 2 m a z m becomes 2'3l(a i a 2 a i ) m ; or 

Z{a ia2 c h y = i (SJ - SS 2m S m + 2S 3m ). 

213. By means of the theory of symmetrical functions we 
are able to transform an equation into another the roots of 
which shall be given functions of those of the proposed equa- 
tion. The following transformation, having, at one time, been 
proposed as a mean of separating the roots of an equation, is 
of some interest. 

214. To transform an equation into another whose roots 
are the squares of the differences of the roots of the proposed 
equation. 



SYMMETRICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE ROOTS. 161 

Let a ly a 2 , a 3 , a n , be the roots of the proposed equa- 
tion, then the roots of the required transformed equation 
will be 

(a, — a 2 )\ {fr — a 3 ) 2 , (a- 2 — a 6 f, &c. 

and will be in number \n (n— 1), the possible number of dif- 
ferent combinations of n things taken two at a time. The 
degree of the transformed equation will therefore be \n (n— 1) 
= m suppose. 
Let y m + q iy m ~ l + q 2 y m ~ 2 + . . . . q m = 

be the transformed equation, and s lr s 2 ,....s r denote the 

sums of the first, second, r th powers of its roots. When 

we have determined the values of these sums of the powers 
we can obtain the coefficients, since (210) q x = — Si , 
q 2 = — \ (s 2 4- q\ Si), &c. ; it remains therefore to find a gen- 
eral expression for any sum as s r . 

Let Si, S 2 , S m9 denote, as before, the sums of the 

powers of the roots of the proposed equation, then 

(x _ ai yr + (x- a 2 ) 2r + (x- a,) 2r + . . . ■ (x - a n ) 2r 

= nx 2 '- - 2rS 1 x 2r ~ 1 + 2r( f'~ 1) S 2 x 2 '~ 2 + ....S 2r . 

In the first member of the above equation, when we put a x 
for x, we obtain the sum of the r th powers of the squares of the 
differences in which a\ comes first ; when we put a 2 for x, we 
obtain the sum of the r th powers of the squares of the differ- 
ences in which a 2 comes first, and so on ; if therefore we 
put cii , a 2 , a 3 , . . . . a n , in succession for x, and add all the 
results, we obtain 

2s r = nS 2r - 2rS, # 2 ,_i + ^p^ S 2 S, r . 2 -....*&. 

The terms to the right hand that are equidistant from the 
beginning and end are equal; collecting and dividing by 2, 
we have 

s r = nS 2r - 2rS l 8 2r -i + ^^ S 2 S 2r . 2 + . . . . 



+ i (_l)^^-l)^..(r + _l)^ 



162 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

To obtain the required transformation, we accordingly first 
find S l9 S 2 , $,,.... by (208) from the coefficients of the 
proposed equation ; we then, by means of the formula just 

given, find in succession s u s 2 , s m ; and, finally, by means 

of the formulas q x = — s u $2 = — ifa + qisj, &c, obtain 
the coefficients of the required equation. 

The impracticable nature of a method of analysis requiring, 
as a mere preliminary to the separation of the roots of an 
equation of the sixth degree, the calculation of fifteen coeffi- 
cients through these three stages, is self-evident. 

215. The theory of symmetrical functions may also be 
applied to the elimination of one of the unknown quantities 
between two simultaneous equations. See Art. 227. 

216. The sums of the powers of the roots may be advan- 
tageously employed in certain cases to obtain an approximation 
to the roots of an equation. * 

Let Oi, a 2 , (hi denote the roots of an equation in de- 
scending order of magnitude, then we have 

Sm+i ai m+1 + d2 m+1 + «3 W+1 4- • • • • 



S m a{ n +a 2 m +a g m + 



»+er+(sr + 



Now the fractions l—J , (— ) , &c, may be made as 

small as we like by taking m large enough. -~^ is therefore 

an approximation to the greatest real root a x , provided that 
it be greater than the modulus of any imaginary pair, the 
approximation becoming closer as m increases. 

217. But if there be a pair of imaginary roots whose 
modulus is greater than the greatest real root, we cannot ob- 

* This was first suggested by Newton, and was further developed by Lagrange. 
The subject will be found very fully treated in Murphy's Equations. 



SYMMETRICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE ROOTS. 163 

tain an approximation to that root as above. For (Trig.) these 
imaginary roots may be put under the form |u(cos ± sin 0a/-1), 
where \i is the modulus ; then 

- 2cos(m + l)0+ (^) + (^T\ .... 

- r 



& 



»«"• +(?) + (?)' 



# m +i -5" $» therefore approximates to ju ■ — ^ , which 

may have any value. 

218. Again, if the two greatest roots, a Y , a 2 , are real, 
if «x and « 2 are imaginary, then 

In either case, therefore, we have 

# OT = «! w + fl 2 m , nearly, when m is taken large enough. 
S m+1 =a 1 m+1 +a 2 m+1 , nearly, 
^m+2 = «i wl+2 + «2 W+2 , nearly, 

each equation being more nearly true than the preceding one ; 

••• S m S m +2—S m+ i 2 = («i« 2 ) m («i— a 2 ) 2 = u m , 

S m +i S M+3 — S m+2 2 = (« l « 2 ) ,n+1 («i— «2) 2 = « m +i5 
.-. — — = a x a 2 , approximatively. 

That is, if from every three terms of the series /Si, 8 2 , S 3 , &c, 
another series 2 w m be formed by subtracting the square of the 
means from the product of the extremes, the quotients ob- 
tained by dividing each term of this new series by the term 
that precedes it, approximate more and more nearly to the 
product of the two greatest roots. If the two greatest roots 
are real, then the greater being known by (216), the second 
becomes known by this process. If they are imaginary, we 
can proceed to find their sum as follows. 



164 ALGEBEAICAL EQUATIONS. 

219. As in the preceding case, we can find from the values 
of S m , S m+U &h- 2 , &c, that 

S M S m+3 — S m +iS m + 2 = ffra 2 m («i+a2)(«i-«2) 2 nearly, = v m say. 

Dividing this by u m , we obtain a x -f a 2 nearly ; that is, if 

from every four terms of the series S l9 S 2 , S s , another 

series 2 v m be formed by subtracting the product of the means 
from the product of the extremes, then the quotients obtained 
by dividing each term of this series by the corresponding term 
of the series 2 u m approach more and more nearly to the sum 
of the two greatest roots. 

The sum and the product of two imaginary roots having 
been found in this way, each can then be determined by a 
quadratic. 

Ex. a 4 — x s + 4z 2 + x —4 = 0. 

28 m = 1,-7,-14, 29,96,-34,-503,-347, 2083,3838,-6159. 
2 u m = -63,-399,-2185,-10202,-49444,-241211,-1168158. 
2 ^=-69,-266,-2308,-11323,-50414,-245363,-1207713. 

The first series being divergent shows that the roots 
«!, a 2 are imaginary. From the second series we obtain 

aiCk = = 4.84; from the second and third we 

241211 1207713 
have ai -f- «2 = TTfi81^8 = 1-03; the roots a lf a 2 are, 

therefore, \ (1 . 03 ± 4 . 3 V^l). 

For the purpose of calculating real roots this method is 
obviously too laborious if we aim at accuracy to several places 
of decimals ; but in some cases this appears to be the most 
convenient process yet proposed for approximating to the real 
and imaginary parts of impossible roots. 

220. If an equation of any degree has only two imaginary 
roots, they can easily be determined, if required, in the follow- 
ing manner, which may be advantageously employed to deter- 
mine the remaining roots of any equation when all but two 
have been calculated. 

Let k x and K m denote respectively the sum and product of 
the ascertained values of all the roots but two, and ti and t 2 



SYMMETRICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE ROOTS. 165 

the sum and product of the remaining two ; then ( 45 ) 
t x = —(C n . x + K x ), and t 2 = {—l)*C -7-K m ; the two roots, there- 
fore, can be obtained from the formula, x = \ (^liV^i 2 — 4£ 2 ). 

Ex. 1. In the equation already given, 

ic 4 — x 3 + 4z 2 + x — 4 = 0, 

we see at once (189), since 1 — 4x2 is negative, that there 
are two imaginary roots, and the final sign being negative, the 
other two are real, one of each sign. By Horner's Method 
the values of these roots, .892232.. and —.923262.., are 
calculated accurately to six places of decimals with less labor 
than is required to obtain the first series 2S m . The sum of 
these roots is —.03103, therefore t x = 1.03103; the product 
of the above roots is — .823765 ; dividing the final term — 4 
by this, we obtain t 2 = 4.855762. . ; hence we obtain for the 
roots |(1.03108.. ± 4.284857. ,'V^l). One advantage in 
obtaining the last two roots in this manner is that we are 
enabled to perform much of the calculation by logarithms. 

Ex. 2. In the equation, 

ofi + 173^ + 2356a? -f 10468a: 2 — 14101a; + 4183 = 0, 

there is a pair of imaginary roots. The sum of the real 
roots is found to be —157.438702.., hence t x = (—173 
+ 157.438702) = - 15.561297. .. The product of the real 
roots is — 49 . 9555 . . ; dividing — 4183 by this, we obtain 
t 2 = 83.73454.. ; hence we find the roots to be —7.780648 
± V— 23.19607. 

221. If all the roots of an equation of the fourth degree 
are imaginary, we can always obtain their values by means of 
Descartes' reducing cubic (129). If, then, an equation of any 
degree has only four imaginary roots, we can, after obtaining 
the real roots, depress it to a biquadratic, and then obtain the 
imaginary roots. Unless, therefore, an equation has as many 
as six imaginary roots, we can depress the equation to one 
capable of algebraical solution, and thus obtain the values of 
the imaginary roots with comparative facility. But if an 
equation of the sixth degree, or one that has been depressed to 
that degree, has all its roots imaginary, the method of Art. 219 



166 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

appears to afford the readiest solution. We can first, by that 
method, find the two greatest of these roots ; then, by taking 
the coefficients in reverse order, and repeating the process, we 
obtain the reciprocals of the two smallest roots; finally, having 
thus determined four roots, we can easily obtain the sum and 
product of the remaining pair, and thus determine them also. 

222. Theoretically the determination of the values of 
imaginary roots may be effected as follows. If in the proposed 
equation f(x) = 0, we substitute a + < 3 V— 1 for x, we ob- 
tain (26) a result of the form P + Q V^l = ; hence we 
obtain two equations, P = 0, and Q = 0, each involving a 
and (3. As will be shown in the next chapter, we can from 
these equations always determine the corresponding values of 
a and 0. But, if f(x) be of the sixth degree, this method 
requires the formation and part solution of an auxiliary equa- 
tion of the fifteenth degree, while, if f(x) is of the eighth de- 
gree, the auxiliary equation rises to the 28th degree.

CHAPTER XIII. 

ELIMINATION. 

223. Two equations involving each two unknown quan- 
tities x and y may be denoted by F(x, y) = 0, and f(x, y) 
= ; their solution consists in the determination of the sys- 
tems of values of x and y which cause both equations to 
vanish simultaneously. In certain cases the solution is readily 
effected. Thus, if from one of the equations we are able to 
obtain an expression for the value of one of the unknown 
quantities, as x, in terms of the other y, by the substitution 
of this value for x in the other equation we obtain an equa- 
tion involving y only, the roots of which can be determined 
by methods already given , and these values of y substituted 
in the expression for x in terms of y, will give the corres- 
ponding values of x. 

Ex. x 3 — (y + 2)a 2 + (if — 2y)x — 12 = 0, 
x 2 — yx + 2 =0. 

From the second equation we obtain y = x -\ . This 

x 

value of y substituted in the first equation gives us 

x* — 2x* -f 4z 3 — 4:X — 8 = 0. 

Of this, one value is x = 2, and for this value of x, y — 3, 
which values cause both equations to vanish simultaneously. 
The other values of x, being determined, would in like manner 
give corresponding values of y. 

224. Also, if the first members of the equations can be 
readily resolved into factors, the solution of the equations may 
be made to depend upon that of equations of inferior degrees. 
If, for example, we find F(x, y) = UV U" = 0, and f{x, y) 
= VV = 0, then the systems of values that satisfy the pro- 



1C8 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

posed equations may be obtained by solving the simultaneous 
equations U = and V = ; U = and V = ; U' = 
and V = ; U' == and F' = ; C/"=0 and 7=0; 
Z7" = and V = 0. 
Let F(x, y) = x*y — (f—2y)x 2 +(y z + 2y)x -if- 2y 2 = 0, 
f(x,y) = a? - (y + 1) z 2 - (2 - y) » + 2 = 0. 

These may be resolved as follows, 

F(x,y) = (o; 2 -^ + 2/ 2 )(^-^_2) = 0, 
/(»,y) = (x*-xy-2){x + y - 1) =0. 

The systems of values that satisfy the proposed equations 
can therefore be obtained by solving the equations 

x 2 — xy + if = I , x 2 — xy — y % = > 
x 2 — X y — 2 = ) , x + # '— 1 = > ' 

^-^-2=0), ^_ 2/ 3_2=0) 
z2_ a ^_2 = 0J\ a; 4. ^ _i = o J. 

225. But if one of the factors of F(x, y) is identical with 
one of the factors of f(x, y) ; if, for example, U and V are 
identical, then, obviously, any values of x and y that make 
U vanish will cause both the proposed equations to vanish 
simultaneously. If U involves both x and y, we can assign 
any value we please to one of these unknowns, and determine 
the corresponding value, or values, of the other that will cause 
U to vanish, and thus obtain as many solutions as we please. 
If U involves only one of the unknown quantities, we can 
satisfy the equations F(x, y) = 0, and f(x, y) = by giving 
to that unknown quantity any value that causes U to vanish, 
and to the other any value we please. In order, therefore, that 
the proposed equations be determinate, that is, be satisfied 
by a limited number of corresponding values of x and y, they 
must not have a common divisor involving x or y. 

226. To eliminate between two equations, each involving 
the same two unknown quantities, is to deduce an equation, 
involving only one of these unknown quantities, the solution 
of which will furnish all the values of that quantity, which, 
taken with the corresponding values of the other, satisfy the 



ELIMINATION-. 169 

proposed equations. The equation thus deduced is called the 
final equation, and its roots are called suitable values. 

227. To eliminate one of the unknown quantities between 
two equations involving tivo unknown quantities by means of 
symmetrical functions. 

Let p x n + pi x n ~ l + p 2 x n ~ 2 +....p n = 0, [1] 

q x>» + q x x m ~ l + q 2 x m ~ 2 + . . . . q m = 0, [2] 

be the proposed equations, in which the coefficients p Q , p i} 

p 2 , q , q l9 q 29 are rational integral functions of y. 

Assume that we can solve equation [1] in respect to x 9 in 
terms of y, and that these values are a, b, c, &c. By substi- 
tuting these values in equation [2], we obtain n equations 
involving only y, namely : 

q Q a m + q x a m - 1 + q 2 a m ~ 2 + . . .. q m = \ 

q Q b m + q,b m ~ l + q 2 b m ~ 2 + . . . . q m = > [3]. 

q Q c m + qic m ~ l + q 2 c m ~ 2 + . . -. . q m = J 

In general the solution of [1] cannot be effected ; but by 
multiplying together all the above n equations, we obtain a 
final equation which has for roots all the suitable values of y. 
For this equation will vanish for any of the values of y that 
makes any of its factors vanish, and for no others ; and any of 
these is a suitable value. For suppose the first of the equa- 
tions [3] vanishes for y = (3, and that when (3 is put for y in 
the function a, the value is a ; then x = a, y = p will 
satisfy the two proposed equations. Now in the final equa- 
tion, which is the product of all the equations [3], the factors 
only change places when we interchange any of the quantities 

a, b, c, , thus the product is a symmetrical function of 

these quantities, which may be expressed in terms of the 

coefficients p Q , p l9 p 2 , of equation [1], and thus we can 

obtain the final equation in y which contains all the suitable 
values, and no other. 

228. Though the preceding method of elimination has the 
merit of furnishing a final equation with all the suitable values, 



170 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

and no others, the calculations required are so tedious that 
the method is not generally available. Upon it is based, how- 
ever, the following theorem : 

229. The degree of the final equation resulting from the 
elimination of one of the unknown quantities between two equa- 
tions of the m th and n th degrees respectively, ivill not exceed mn. 

Let p^x n + pxx"- 1 + p 2 x n - 2 + p n = 0, 

q x m + qi x m ~ l + q- 2 x m - 2 + . . . . q m = 0, 

be the proposed equations in which the coefficients are func- 
tions of y. Here it is supposed that the sum of the exponents 
of x and y does not exceed n in any term of the first equa- 
tion, or m in the second, so that a coefficient p r or q r is a 
function of y not higher than the r th degree. 

Suppose x to be eliminated by the method of Art. 228 ; 
then the first member of the final equation in y consists of a 
series of terms, each of which is the product of n factors, and 

is of the form q r a m - r x q s b m ~ s x qtC"-* x Since (227) the 

series of terms forms a symmetrical function of a, b, c, , 

the aggregate of the terms, with exponents as above, is, 

q r q s q t I a m ~ r b m ~ s c m - 1 

Now the degree of y in q r q 8 q t .... is not higher than 

r + s -f t -f , and it will be shown that the degree of y 

in 1 a m ~ r b m ~ s c m ~ l . . . cannot exceed m— r+m— s+m — 1+ '. ., 
so that the degree of the whole product is not greater than mn. 
For from the formulae in Art. 208 we see that S p , for example, 
does not contain any power of y greater than y p ; and from 

the formulae in Art. 211 a function la h b k c l will contain 

powers and products of Si, S 2 , S h+M . l+ .., in each term 

the sum of the letters subscript to S being h +£ + /+ . . ; the 
degree of y in the function 1 a m ~ r b m ~ s c 111 ' 1 . . . cannot therefore 
exceed m+r+m—s+m—t-\- . . . ; hence no power of y in 
the final equation can be higher than y" m . 

230. Although the degree of y in the final equation can- 
not exceed mn, it may in certain cases be less. By an exten- 
sion of the process to any number of equations we are led to 
the general theorem discovered by Bezout, namely : 



ELIMINATION. 171 

If between any number of equations involving the same 
number of unknown quantities we eliminate all but one, the 
degree of the final equation will not exceed the product of 
the degrees of the original equations. 

231. The elimination of one of the unknown quantities 
between two equations is most conveniently effected by the 
following method, based upon the operation for obtaining the 
greatest common measure of two algebraical quantities. 

To determine the systems of values that will satisfy two 
equations involving two unknown quantities. 

Let F(x, y) = and f(x.,y) = be two equations, which 
we shall suppose have no common factor and thus admit of a 
limited number of solutions. Suppose that x = a and y = (3 
are values that satisfy these equations, then F(a, y) = and 
f(a, y) = are both satisfied by y = (3. F(a, y) and f(a, y) 
must therefore have a common measure which, equated to zero, 
will have for a root a value of y which, conjointly with x = a, 
will satisfy the proposed equations. Having therefore arranged 
both equations according to descending powers of x, we pro- 
ceed by the operation for the G. C. M. till we arrive at a 
remainder independent of x, say r/>(?/). 

Now if no factors, functions of y, have been introduced or 
suppressed in the operation, so as to avoid having y in a denom- 
inator, (p(y) = will comprise all the suitable values of y, and 
no others. For unless (f>(y) = 0, F(a, y), and f(a, y) have no 
common measure and therefore do not vanish simultaneously. 
But if it has been necessary to introduce factors, functions of 
y, then some of the roots of <j>(y) = may not be suitable 
values, having been introduced with these factors; and if 
factors have been suppressed, there may be suitable values of 
y not found among the roots of <f>(y) = 0. 

232. A process by which the suitable values of y may be 
determined is furnished in the following method due to M. M. 
Labatie and Sarrus. 

Let ^4 = and B = be the two simultaneous equations, 
of which neither has a factor a function of y only, and B is 
not of higher dimensions in x than A. Let c denote the 



172 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

factor by which A must be multiplied to make it divisible by 
B ; let q be the quotient, and rR the remainder, where r is 
a function of y only. Let c x denote the factor by which B 
must be multiplied to make it divisible by R, let q x be the 
quotient, and r Y R x the remainder, where ?\ is a function of y 
only. Suppose that, proceeding in this way, at the third di- 
vision we arrive at a remainder r 2 independent of x. Thus 
we have the identities, 

cA = qB + rR, \ 

Cl B = q 1 R + r 1 R l , V [1]. 

c 2 R = q 2 R\+ r 2 . ) 

Let d be the G. C. M. of c and r, d x the G. C. M. of 

-j- 1 and ri, cl 2 the G. C. M. of -j-j- and r 2 . We have now 

cl Cl Cl\ 

to show that the solution of the equations A = 0, B = 0, 
will be obtained by solving the equations : 



B = J , i? = J , i?! = 



I. -4W the solutions obtained from this system of equations 
satisfy the equations A = 0, B = 0. 

Dividing both members of the first identity [1] by d, we 
have 

i a = 1 5 + ;* p» 

Since *7 is the G. C. M. of c and r, -7 and — are integral 

~ a a 

functions of y, therefore also -^B is an integral function ; but, 

by hypothesis, B has no factor which is a function of y only, 
therefore d must divide q. 

From [3] we see that the values of x and y that satisfy the 

7* C 1* 

equations -= = and B = make -^^4 also vanish ; but -r 
^ c d d a 

and -7 have no common factor, therefore these values make A 
d r 

vanish. Hence all the solutions of -=• = and B = 0, satisfy 
A = 0, B = 0. 



divides —± and r l9 and does not divide R. Divide by d ly 
then putting M for -^ and M l for Cir J~ 7 q9l 9 we have 






ELIMINATION. 173 

Again multiplying both members of the identity [3] by c { , 
and substituting for c x B its equivalent from the second iden- 
tity in [1], we have 

d ad 

The expression - — j is integral, since r and q are 

divisible by d; the expression is also divisible by d x , for ^

Multiplying both members of the second identity [1] by -^

Since d x divides C -~ and r u it will divide — ^-R; but R 
is not divisible by d x , therefore —y- must be so. Dividing by 
d x and putting N for y and JVi for -—-, we have 

The identities [4] and [5] show that all the values of z and

but -=-4- and -^ have no common factor; therefore all the

solutions of the equations -y = and i2 = satisfy the 
equations A = 0, B = 0. 

In the same way, if we multiply both members of the iden- 
ties [4] and [5] by c 2 , and substitute for c 2 R its equivalent 
from the third identity [1], we obtain 

C2 -A = M 2 R l+ ^-M ly [6].

Multiply [4] by B, [5] by J, and subtract, then 
(M Y B - N X A)R + (MB - iVJ)^ 1 2?! = 0, 
therefore, by [8], 

(M X B - N i A)R - ?~RRi = 0, 

therefore M x B - N X A = ~ R x . [9] . 

In the same way, from [6] and [7], we may deduce

This last identity shows that all the values of x and y that

since -j does not vanish when y = (3, it follows from [8] that

the values x = a, y = (3, make i? vanish ; thus they satisfy 
5 = and 7£ = 0. 

(3). If (3 is not a root of the equation -=- = 0, nor of -r = 0, 
but is of the equation — = 0, then, since -r T does not 
vanish when y = j3, it follows from [9] that the values x — a, 
y = (3 make 
and Ei = 0. 

7* 7*i 7*o 

The equation 7 7 7 = 0, which furnishes all the suitable 
^ 6? di a 2 

values of y, may be called the final equation in y. 

233. If, instead of a final remainder in y, we arrive at a 
remainder zero, this shows that A and B have the preceding 
remainder, say i? b as a common factor. Then, as we saw in 
Art. 225, the equations A = and B = will be satisfied 
by an unlimited number of values of x and y derived from 
the equation R x = 0. By dividing by this common measure, 

A B A 

we obtain -^- and -^j-, which have no common factor, then -^ = 

and -=- = will be satisfied for a limited number of values 
Mi 

of x and y, which may be found as above. 

If the final remainder is a mere number, say /, then the 
equation I = being absurd shows that the proposed equa- 
tions are incompatible with each other. 

Ex. 1. a* 3 4- 3yx* + (Sy* — y + 1)» + y z — y 2 + 2y = 0. 
a* 2 + 2y:c + y* — y — 0. 

Here the first remainder is # + 2y, so that r = 1 ; the 
second remainder is ?/ 2 — y, which is independent of x. All 

the solutions are furnished by -j = and R = 0, that is, by 

the equations y 2 — y = 0, and a; + 2# = 0. 

Ex. 2. x* + 2?/e 2 + 2y(y—2)x + ?/ 2 — 4 = 0. 
z 2 + fyz + 2t/ 2 — 5# + 2 = 0. 

The first remainder is (y— 2)(a* + ?/ + 2) ; so that 7* = y— 2, 



176 ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS. 

R = x + y -f 2 ; the second remainder is y 2 — by + 6, which. 

T 

is independent of #. All the solutions are furnished by - = 

and B = 0, that is, by the equations # — 2 = and x 2 + 2xy 

+ 2y 2 — by + 2 = 0; and by -^ = and R = 0, that is, 

by x 2 — by + 6 = and a + # + 2 = 0. The final equa- 
tion in y is (y — 2) (?/ 2 — 5y + 6) = 0. 

Ex. 3. x* + 3ijx 2 — 3x 2 -{-3y 2 x—6yx— x—tf>— 3y 2 —y-\-3 = 0. 
x z—3yx 2 -\-3x 2 + 3y 2 x—6yx—x—y s + 3y 2 + y—3 = 0. 

The first remainder is 2{y — 1) (3x 2 -\- y 2 — 2y — 3); the 
second remainder is 8 (y 2 — 2y)x ; the third, which is inde- 
pendent of x, is y 2 — 2y — 3. The solutions are furnished 
by the systems of equations, 

y— 1 = and x*— 3yx 2 + 3x 2 + 3y 2 x-6yx-x-y3+3y 2 +y-3 = 0; 
y 2 — 2y = and 3x 2 + y 2 — 2y — 3 = ; 
2/2 _ 9y — 3 = and x = 0. 

The final equation in y is (y—l)(y 2 —2y)(y 2 —2y—3) = 0. 

Ex. 4. yx? — (y 3 — 3y — l)x + y = 0. 

x 2 — y 2 + 3 =0. 

The first remainder is z -f- ?/ ; the second is 3 ; the proposed 
equations are therefore incompatible.
