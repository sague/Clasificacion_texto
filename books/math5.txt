PREFACE 

Nothing causes more trouble to young inatliematicians than the 
traditional method of introducing complex numbers into algebra. 
The student knows that the square root of minus one is neither 
a positive nor a negative number, and that it is not equal to zero. 
Nobody has ever told him that there are any numbers which are 
neither positive, nor negative, nor zero. In spite of this, square 
roots of negative numbers are introduced for him to reckon with. 
Of course he does not know what they mean and he becomes sus- 
picious. Even later, if a concrete representation of these so- 
called " imaginary " numbers is ever presented to him, he never 
quite gets over his first suspicions ; the uncomfortable feeling re- 
mains within him that, somehow, he has been cheated, that imag- 
inary numbers are impossible and without meaning. 

It is historically correct to introduce imaginaries in this way. 
But the student's doubts are also justified historically. His sus- 
picious attitude toward imaginary numbers is merely a repeti- 
tion of the position taken by the whole mathematical world from 
the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. 

The historical order of presentation is not ahvays the best peda- 
gogic order, and the subject of complex numbers is one of the most 
striking instances ichere the historical order should be avoided. 

In Chapter I of the present book, the imniber system of algebra, 
up to and including the system of complex numbers, is developed 
in a concrete and convincing way by means of the geometry of 
directed line-segments or vectors. No student will feel any doubt 
concerning the legitimacy of complex numbers, after mastering 
this chapter, unless his suspicions have been previously aroused in 
his first course in algebra. In a sense, Chapter I may be regarded 
as devoted to the foundations of algebra. It is not, however, a 
chapter on foundations in the formal technical sense in which 
that word is being used at the present time. 

Chapter I also serves the purpose of revieicing the most ele- 



iv PREFACE 

mentary parts of arithmetic and algebra. A revieio, tvJiich is a 
mere repetition of material covered once before, is a great ivaste of 
time. For this reason no formal review work is offered at the be- 
ginning of the book. The review work is scattered through the 
various chapters. It is placed wherever it is needed for the pur- 
poses in hand, and it is always illuminated by the discussions 
which precede and follow it. That everything really essential is 
covered by this kind of a review is guaranteed by the nature of 
the book which, while intended for use in college, is built up from 
iirst principles, so that no reference to more elementary books on 
algebra is ever necessary. A fairly mature mind might begin his 
study of algebra with this book. 

The principal criticism of " college algebra " as a course has 
been its lack of unity. This criticism seems to be exceedingly 
well founded, if we examine the various texts on the subject 
which have appeared to date. The present book ivas vritten pri- 
marily for the purpose ofshoiving, that the undoubted scrajjpiness of the 
traditional course in college algebra is due to poor arrangement and 
piresentation, and not to any intrinsic defect of the subject itself. The 
following sketch of the contents of the book will show how the 
desired unification has been accomplished. 

The function concept is the central notion of the book. Chapter I, 
as has been mentioned, is devoted to the number system, a neces- 
sary preliminary. Chapter II begins with a general discussion of 
the function concept and takes up in detail the simplest cases, 
namely the subject of variation, and linear functions of a single 
variable, the graphs of such functions being introduced at an 
early stage. Chapter III deals with quadratic functions and 
equations. Chapter IV with integral rational functions of any 
order, the corresponding equations, and the numerical calculation 
of their roots (theory of equations) ; this treatment is completed 
in (Jhapter V by a discussion of the algebraic calculation of their 
roots, the fundamental theorem, and so on. Chapter VI deals 
with fractional rational functions, in particular with their expres- 
sion as a sum of partial fractions. Chapter VII discusses the 
simplest irrational functions and formulates the distinction be- 
tween algebraic and transcendental functions. Chapter VIII 
follows with the general power function, the exponential func- 
tion, and logarithms. 

In Chapter IX functions of more than one variable are intro- 



PREFACE V 

(lueed, linear functions to begin with, leading to determinants of 
the second and third order. In preparation for the general 
theory of determinants of the ?ith order, we interpolate a 
chapter (Chapter X) on permutations and combinations, followed 
by Chapter XI on probability. We are now ready for Chapter 
XII, which discusses linear functions of oi variables and determi- 
nants of the nth order. Chapter XIII goes on with the discussion 
of quadratic functions of two independent variables, and simul- 
taneous quadratics. 

So far the functions considered have been functions of contin- 
uous variables. If, instead, we restrict the variable to integral 
values, every function gives rise to a sequence. Thus a linear 
function gives rise to an arithmetic progression and, for this 
reason, arithmetic progressions are included in Chapter II. Har- 
monic and geometric progressions, suggested by analogy, are also 
treated in Chapter II. 

In Chapter XIV, however, the discontinuous variable is em- 
phasized, and results in a more extensive discussion of sequences 
and series with a finite number of terms. Chapter XV and XVI, 
on limits and series, now follow naturally from the suggestions 
of Chapter XIV and earlier chapters. 

Tlie applications are scattered through the entire hook and form an 
integral part of it. They are discussed with as much care as 
though the book had been written for their sake. Only ajjpli- 
cations of real and general importance have been included, making 
the course in algebra a valuable adjunct to the courses in physics and 
chemistry. These applications include such subjects as the meas- 
urement of length, time, and mass ; the theory of the vernier, slide 
rule, logarithmic paper, and of scales in general ; the notions of 
velocity, acceleration, density, specific gravity, force, uniform 
motion, uniformly accelerated motion, pressure of gases ; the 
principle of Archimedes, the motion of a projectile, Doppler's 
principle, the theory of dimensions in physics, and indirect analy- 
sis in chemistry. They also include a discussion of compound 
interest, annuities, and life insurance ; the comj)Oun(l interest law 
and its applications to dampened vibrations, transmission of 
light, pressure in the atmosphere, and cooling bodies. Professor 
A. C. Lunn was kind enough to give the author the benefit of his 
criticisms on some of these topics, and we take this opportunity of 
expressing our indebtedness to him. 



vi PREFACE 

Each of these applications is discussed as carefully as though the 
book ivere a treatise on chemistry or physics. The student is never 
asked to do examples involving applications which he cannot 
understand because the fundamental principles are not explained. 
Of course, these applications are here classified from the mathe- 
matical point of view, and therefore they appear in an order 
different from that which would result if the point of view were 
primarily physical or chemical. But the student can only gain 
by having the same subject appear in such a different way in 
several of his courses. 

AVe have explained the general policy of the book. Much more 
might be said about specific details in which it differs from other 
books ; we hope that the reader will discover these for himself, 
and thus make it unnecessar}' for us to unduly expand this 
preface. We close with the request that all prospective users of 
the book read the suggestions to the instructor and to the student 
given on pages vii and ix. An answer book will be supplied to 
those classes whose instructors wish this to be done.

SUGGESTIONS TO THE INSTRUCTOR 

The material incliuled in this book probably contains everything ever 
given under the title " College Algebra" in any American college. But it 
includes more than can be given profitably in any one course of about 
fifty recitations. It will usually be necessary to make a selection. The 
following sample outlines of courses are intended to be helpful in this 
connection. But it should be understood that, although they have been 
considered carefully, many different selections might be made by the 
instructor, who probably knows the special needs of his class better than 
the author. 

Another possible way of using the book would be to consolidate the 
courses in College Algebra and Analytic Geometry, supplementing the book 
with explanations by the teacher on such topics in analytic geometry as 
are not included. It may also be used as a basis for a course in higher 
algebra. 

Course A 

Short course. Emphasis upon the applications. 
Articles 16-75, 78-113, 126-132, 135-146, 148-151, 156-182, 
185-212. 

Much of this work has been covered in the student's high school course 
and may be reviewed in a brief time. Arts. 167-17.5 (on calculation with 
logarithms) may be transferred to the course in trigonometry. Arts. 80, 
195, 190 may be omitted. 

The subjects included in Course A may be treated in the order given in 
the book, or else in the order : Chapters I, II, IX, III, IV, etc. ; or Chap- 
ters I, II, III, IX, IV, etc. 

Course B 

To Course A add articles 213-217, 219-227, 238-240, 243-252, 
256, on permutations, combinations, probability, and simultaneous 
quadratics. 

Course C 

To Course A add articles 257-297, on summation of series, 
limits, and infinite series. 



viii SUGGESTIONS TO THE INSTRUCTOR 

Course D 

Short course. Emphasis upon the purely mathematical aspects. 
Articles 1-38, 50-78, 82-111, 114-120, 126-145, 147-184, 
197-210. 

See remarks under Course A. 

Course E 

To Course D add articles 213-217, 219-227, 238-240, 243-252, 
256, on permutations, combinations, probability, and simultaneous 
quadratics. 

Course F 

To Course D add articles 257-297, on summation of series, 
limits, and infinite series. 



SUGGESTIONS TO THE STUDENT 

Material 

The student should provide himself with a pair of compasses, a 
ruler divided decimally into centimeters and millimeters, and a 
quantity of cross-section paper (preferably millimeter paper), for 
facilitating his graphic work. 

General Directions for Study 

1. Carefully read the assigned lesson. 

2. Test your understanding of the j)rinciples involved as 
follows : 

(a) Convince yourself that you are really able to follow the 

logic of the argument by stating, explicitly, a reason 
in justification of every one of its steps. 

(b) Try to discover a fundamental idea which runs through 

the argument and illuminates it. This, together with 
(a), will enable you to master the whole argument, so 
as to reproduce it and to use similar reasoning, else- 
where, under similar circumstances. 

(c) See whether you can appreciate the practical importance 

of the subject under discussion by finding some appli- 
cations of it. 

3. If this test of yourself, recommended in No. 2, turns out to 
your own satisfaction, proceed to the examples. 

4. If your self-examination -has had an unsatisfactory result, 
find out whether your difficulty should be classified under 2a, 2b, 
or 2c. If it falls under 2a, try to find out just where the argument 
begins to become unintelligible for the first time, and fix your at- 
tention on the statements made at that ])oint. Look up, in 
review, the definitions of the terms which are used in those state- 
ments. Nothing causes more trouble in mathematics than lack 
of appreciation of just what the definitions say. If you find 



X SUGGESTIONS TO THE STUDENT 

that your trouble is not with the definitions, search your memory 
and your text for passages dealing with the subjects that cause 
the difficulty. Use the index and the table of contents. Finally, 
if you fail to conquer the difficulty, formulate it in writing as a 
question to your instructor. Often you will be able to answer 
your question yourself after having put it into written form. 

If your difficulty is not with 2a, but with 26, or 2c, tr}^ the ex- 
amples. They will probably helj) you. 

5. Make your oral and written statements clear and unambig- 
uous. As a test of clearness, imagine yourself addressing a 
person of intelligence who is properly prepared to follow your 
argument, but do not expect him to do any mind-reading. Ask 
yourself this question : Can such a person be expected to under- 
stand what I have said ? In written work give everything that 
is essential, and try to make no statement which is not literally 
true. Good paper, good ink, and neatness in form are of great 
assistance in orderly thinking, 

6. Formulate in writing questions concerning the lesson. Pre- 
sent them to your instructor. But try first to answer them for 
yourself. 

7. Some students rush to the examples without reading the 
text. You will fail if you adopt this plan. Even if you should 
succeed in solving the examples, you will probably fail to under- 
stand the principles which they are intended to illustrate. It is 
not the purpose of a course in algebra to train you to merely fol- 
low mechanically certain rules of procedure. Make the rules 
your own by practice and memory ; but more important, make 
them truly and permanently your property by means of a thorough 
understanding of the principles upon which they are based.

COLLEGE ALGEBRA WITH 
APPLICATIONS 

CHAPTER I 

THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA 

1. The positive integer. The most fundamental notion of 
arithmetic, that of tlie positive integer^ is obtained by the 
process of counting and becomes familiar to us in our early 
childhood. The names and symbols used for the positive 
integers are well known to all. The following fact is also 
familiar, but its importance justifies an explicit formulation 
at this time. There exists a first positive integer, namely 
unitg, but there is no last. 

2. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of positive in- 
tegers. If the letters a, 5, c, etc., are used to denote given 
positive integers, we know from our early training in arith- 
metic how to form their sums, differences, and products. In 
fact, we know that the sum, a + 5, and the product, a x b or 
ab, is always again a positive integer. This will also be 
true of the difference, a â€” b, provided that a is greater than 
6, that is, (a > b). 

The following laws sum up the most essential properties 
of positive integers, and may be regarded as justified by our 
experience with a large number of special cases : 

I. If we add a positive integer b to another positive integer 
a, we always obtain a uniquely determined positive integer 

c= a -\- b, 

which is called the sum of a and b. 

II. Addition is commutative; that is, a + b = b + a. 

1 



2 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 2 

III. Addition is associative ; that is, 

a+(b + c) = (a + J) + c. 

IV. Addition is monotonic ; that is, if a is greater than b, 
then a + is greater than b + c. In syynbols, 

if a > b, then a + c > b -\- c. 

V. If zve midtiply a positive integer a by another positive 
integer b, tve alivays obtain a uniquely determined positive 
^'^^^9er c = axb = a. b = ab, 

tvhich is called the product of a by b. 

VI. Multiplication is commutative ; that is, a x b = b x a. 

VII. Multiplication is associative; that is, 

a x(b X c') = (a X b') X c. 

VIII. Multiplication is monotonic; that is, 

if a > b, then a x c> b x c. 

IX. Multiplicatioyi is distributive with respect to addition; 
^^"<'^''^' c(a+6) = ca + 6'5. 

Subtraction may be clelined as follows. If a and b are 
positive integers, such that a > b, then there exists a positive 
integer x, tvhich added to b will give a as a sum; that is, if 
a "> b, there exists a positive integer xfor which 

b + x= a. 

This integer x is denoted by 

x= a â€” b, 

and is called the difference between a and b. Moreover, a and 
b are called minuend and subtrahend respectively. 

The laws of subtraction, which are familiar, may be derived 
from this definition and the laws I . . . IX. 

In Algebra we wish to make general statements, applicable to all 
integers. While we can easily verify that the above laws are true of a 
great mnn)j integers, all of those less than ten, for instance, we cannot, by 
the method of actual test, assure ourselves that they are true of all 



Akt. 3] FACTORS OR DIVISORS OF INTEGERS 3 

integers. For we should never get through with the task of testing them 
all, since there is no last integer. (See Art. 1.) Thus it is impossible to 
justifij the general valididj of the above laws on the basis of experience alone. 
On the other hand, a lofjicul proof of these laws could, at best, be only 
partially successful. For sucli a logical proof would consist in showing 
that they are necessary consequences of certain other law's, and then the 
latter would have to remain without a strictly logical proof, however 
plausible it might seem that they should be true. 

Since the laics I . . . IX can never be tested completely by experience, and 
since they can never receive a complete proof by the method of loyic, any 
statement that these laws are universally true is of thr nuturr- of an assumption. 
We therefore speak of these laws as fundamental assumptions * of Algebra. 
They are called fundamental for two reasons. First, because they are 
used in all of the elementary operations of Arithmetic, and second, 
because it can be shown that they are of the greatest importance 
throughout all of Algebra, as will become apparent very soon. To il- 
lustrate the first point, let us multiply 8 by 13. We reason as follows : 

8 X 13 = 8(10 + 3) = 8 â€¢ 10 + 8 â€¢ 3 = 80 + 21 

= 80 + (20 + 4) = (80 + 20) + 4 = 100 + 4 = 104, 

where we have used laws V, IX, III, I. 

This example illustrates the following general statement: To perform 
a calculation with positive integers ice need to know, in the first place, the 
results obtained by the addition, subtraction, and multiplication of any two 
integers less than ten (the addition and multiplication tables^; and in the 
second place, we must know how to apply the nine fundamental laws. 

3. Factors or divisors of integers. Since some positive 
integers may be obtained by multiplying together two or 
more others, it becomes important to understand the fol- 
lowing definitions : 

If a positive integer n can he expressed as a product of two 
or more positive integers., each of the latter integers is said to he 
a factor or divisor of n. 

If an integer has no integral divisors excepting itself and 
unity., it is said to he a prime number. All other integers are 
said to he composite. 

The lowest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. 

* We do this in spite of the fact tliat it is possible to build up Algebra on 
fewer assumptions than we have here listed. 



4 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 4 

4. Division of integers. Let B and d be two positive in- 
tegers, D being greater than d. \i D has c? as a factor, we 
may write 

(1) D = dq, 

where q, the second factor, is also a positive integer. It is 
customary to write (1) in the equivalent form 

(2) . = f, 

and to speak of q as the quotient obtained by dividing D (the 
dividend) by d (the divisor). 

Thus, we may write 14 = 7 â€¢ 2 or 2 = ^. In this case Z) = 14, rf = 7, 
q = 2. 

But suppose that d is not a factor of 2>, and let us ex- 
amine the successive multiples d,2d, 3 c?, etc., of d. Let qd 
be the largest integral multiple of d which is less than Z>, 
so that the next multiple (jq -^l^d will be greater than D. 
We shall then have 

qd<D, (^q + \~)d>D, 

and the difference D â€” qd will be a positive integer r which 
is less than d ; that is, 

(3) D â€” qd = r, or D = qd -\- r, r<d. 

The two positive integers, q and r, which are obtained 
from I) and d by this process are called the quotient and the 
remainder respectively. The process itself is called division, 
and the numbers D and d are the dividend and divisor 
respectively. 

Thus, li D â€” 60, and d = 7, we find 60 = 8 â€¢ 7 + 4, so that the quotient 
is 7 = y and the remainder r = 4. 

We observe that the case, where f? is a factor of i), is 
included as a special case under (3) ; it arises when the re- 
mainder r is equal to zero. 



Art. 5] THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR 5 

5. The greatest common divisor of two integers. As in 
Art. 4 let D and d be two positive integers and let D be the 
greater of the two. Let q be the quotient and r the re- 
mainder obtained when we divide D by d. We shall then 
have 

(1) D â€” qd = r or I) = qd + r, r < d. 

If r = 0, d is a divisor of D, and since d is clearly its own 
greatest divisor, d will then be the greatest common divisor 
oi D and d. 

But suppose that r is not equal to zero. Since q is an 
integer, equation (1) shows that any common divisor of JJ 
and d will also be a divisor of r, and therefore a common 
divisor of d and r. More specifically, the greatest common 
divisor of D and d will also be the greatest common divisor 
of d and r. 

If r is itself a divisor of d, it will be the greatest common 
divisor of r and d, and therefore also of d and D. If r is 
not a divisor of c?, let us divide t? by r Qd being greater than 
r on account of (1)), and let q' be the quotient and r' the 
remainder, so that 

(2) d â€” q'r = r' or d = q'r + r', r' < r. 

Reasoning just as above, we see from (2) that the greatest 
common divisor of d and r will also be the greatest common 
divisor of r and r' . This will be r' itself if r' is an exact 
divisor of r. In that case r' will also be the greatest com- 
mon divisor of D and d. If, however, r' is not an exact 
divisor of r we continue the division process and obtain 

(3) r - q"r' = r" or r= q"r' + r'\ r" < /. 

As we continue in this way tlie successive remainders r, r', r". 
etc. become smaller and snuiUer. We shall tinally reach a 
vanishing remainder, that is, we shall finally obtain an exact 
division. Our argument shows that the last no )t- vanishing 
remainder obtained hg this process is the greatest common divisor 
of D and d. 



6 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 6 

This greatest common divisor may be equal to 1. Since 
any two integers have unity as a common divisor, it is cus- 
tomary to ignore unity as a divisor and to say that two such 
numbers have no common divisor. Two numbers whose great- 
est common divisor is unity, are said to he relatively prime. 

The process for finding the greatest conmion divisor of two positive 
integers is frequently called Euclid's algorithm. It was described and 
applied in Euclid's famous treatise on Geometry called the Elements. 

The lowest common multiple of several integers is the smallest 
integer which is exaetly divisible by each of these integers. 

6. The prime factors of an integer. Let n be any positive 
integer, and let us write down all of the prime numbers 2, 3, 
5, etc. which are not greater tlian n. Then we can find, by 
the process of Art. 5, the greatest common divisor of n and 
the first prime number 2. Since 2 is a prime number its 
only divisors are 1 and 2, so that the greatest common 
divisor of n and 2 can only be either 1 or 2. If it is 1, n and 
2 are prime to each other. If it is 2, then 2 is a divisor of n 
and we may write n = 2 n' where n' is again a positive 
integer. 

In the latter case we may examine n' in the same fashion 
and continue in this way. We shall finally find 



where r and m are integers, and where m is either equal to 
unity or else an integer not divisible b}^ 2. 

We now examine whether m is divisible by the next prime 
number 3. We either find that it is not, or else 

m = 3*jt?, 

where j[? is an integer not divisible by either 2 or 3. As we 
proceed in this way, we shall finally obtain our original 
number 7i expressed in the form of a product 

(1) w = 2'3Â«5'Â».. 

decomposed into its prime factors.

11. Prove the theorem : if p and q are two positive integers and if d

7. Geometric representation of positive integers. We may 

adopt a line-segment of convenient length (say one inch) as 
unit of length. If we find that this unit is contained in 
another line-segment exactly n times, we say that the length 
of the latter is ii units. We may also say that the two line- 
segments represent the integers 1 and n respectively. For 
purposes of comparison of two different line-segments it will 
be convenient to use a line of reference with a scale marked 
upon it in the following way. On any 1234 

line OX (Fig. 1), terminating at (which o a b c b '^ 
point is called the origin of the scale), ^^'^â– ^ 

but unbounded in the direction toward X, we lay off line- 
segments OA, AB, BC, etc., each of unit length, and label 
the points A, B, (7, Z), etc., with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. 
We thus obtain a point of this line corresponding to every 
positive integer and vice versa. Moreover the correspond- 
ence is such that the line-segment which joins the origin to 
the point labeled n on the scale- is just n units long. We 
shall usually think of the line-segments OA, OB, 00, OB, 
etc., as representing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., although 
other line-segments of the same length would do just as 
well. 



8 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 8 

8. Rational numbers. This representation shows that 
there are many points on the line OX which do not corre- 
spond to any integer. We now introduce fractions so as to 
make the correspondence between the points of the scale 
and the numbers more complete. Let us divide the line- 
segment OA (which is of unit length) into an integral num- 
ber of equal parts. Let there be q such parts and let us 
agree to represent the length of one of these parts by the 
ij J 2 3 4 symbol I/5'. (See Fig. 2.) Let us then 

o A B en label the points of OX whose distances 

^^^Â«- ~ from are equal to 1/^, 2(l/g), 3(1/^), 

etc., by the symbols 1/q, 2/q, S/q, etc., and let us do this 
for all values of q beginning with ^ = 2, q = S, 5- = 4, etc. 
We thus obtain a very large number of intermediate points 
on the scale, each of which will have a symbol of the form 
p/q attached to it, where p and q are positive integers. We 
now agree further that each of these new symbols shall be 
regarded as a number and that these new numbers shall be 
called fractions, p is called the numerator and q the denomi- 
nator of the fraction p/q. Of course, unless 5' = 1, these new 
numbers are not integers. Litegers and fractions taken to- 
gether are called rational numbers. 

TJie fraction p/q is the measure of the length of the line- 
segment which joins the origin to the point labeled p/q on 
the scale., this length being measured in terms of the line- 
segment OA as unit of length., where OA is the line-segment 
ivhich joins the origin to the point of the scale which is 
labeled 1. 

It follows from this definition that if a line-segment p 
units long (p being an integer) is divided into q equal 
parts, the length of each part will be p qtlia of a unit ; and 
also that 

(1) P+P' -P_^.p1. 

We now introduce a new kind of division, different from 
that of Art. 4, by the following definition: 



Akt. 9] SOME PROPERTIES OF RATIONAL NUMBERS 9 

To divide a jwsifive integer D {the dividend) hy another 
positive integer d {the divisor) means to divide the line- 
segment of letigth D units into d equal parts and to find the 
length q of one of these parts. This length q in called the 
quotient. 

We now know that this problem always lias a solution, 

namely, 2> 

q = D divided hy d = the fractionâ€” â€¢ 

Consequently the symbol for a fraction D/d may be read : 
D divided hy d. Since we have attached a concrete meaning 
to the operation of dividing one integer by another, the fol- 
lowing definition is now intelligible. 

Any number which may he regarded as the quotient of one 
positive integer divided by another is called a j^ositive rational 
number. 

Of course all integers are included among the rational nurnl)ers, since 
any integer may be regarded as being the quotient obtained by dividing 
that integer itself by unity. 

If D and d are any two positive integers, we may therefore 
always write 

(2) I)-^d = ^=q 

where q is either an integer or a fraction, and this relation 
may be regarded as equivalent to 

(3) D = dq. 

9. Some properties of rational numbers. It is clear that 
the process of introducing intermediate points on the scale 
by making use of fractions will enable us to label many of 
these points in more than one way. Thus, the point which 
corresponds to the symbol ^ is the same as that which corre- 
sponds to |, and the lengths of the corresponding line-seg- 
ments are equal. We therefore agree that the fractions | 
and I shall be regarded as equal. With this introduction, 
the following statements will be easily understood. 



10 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 9 

(a) A rational number p/q^ where p and q are integers, is 
said to he in its lowest terms, if the integers p and q have no 
common divisor except unity, or in other words, if p and q are 
relatively prime. 

(5) Any rational number may be reduced to its loivest terms 
by dividing both numerator and denotninator by their greatest 
common divisor. 

(c) Two rational nu^nbers are equal to each other if they re- 
duce to the same number when both are expressed in their lowest 
terms. 

Thus we have -t- = -J-' 

q mq 

More gCDerally, if p' /q' is equal to p" /q", both of these frac- 
tions will reduce to the same fraction p/q when written in 
their lowest terms. We shall therefore have 

p'=m'p, q' = m'q, p" = m"p, q" =m"q, 



where m' and m" are integers, and consequently 
whence 



p'q" = m'm"pq, p"q' = m'm"pq, 



(1) p'q"=p"q'. 

This relation must hold if the fractions p' /q' and p" /q" are 
equal. 

Conversely, if (1) is satisfied, we may obtain from (1), 
by dividing both of its members by q'q", the equation 

pi _p" 
q' q" 

We may therefore replace statement (c) which involves 
the definition of equality of two rational numbers, by the 
following : 

(c7) Ttvo rational numbers p' /q' and p" /q" are equal, if 

and only if , ,, ,, , 

^ â€¢' p q =p"q' . 

If two rational numbers, p/q and p' /q', are not equal, the 
points, P and P', which represent them on the scale of 



AuT. 10] ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION 11 

rational numbers, will not coincide. We shall say that 
^ is less than ^ , or ^ precedes ^ , 

if P is closer to the origin than P' . (See ,12 p/g p/g' 

Fisr. 3.) In symbols we express this rela- o a b p p' 
,. '' , ^ .,/ ^ Fig. 3 

tion by writing , 

q q' 

The equivalent relation -, > - 

may be read jo'/^'. is greater i\vA\\p/q^ ov p' /q' follows jo/^'. 

We easily recognize the validity of the following numerical 
test : 

(e) The rational number p/q is greater than p' /q' ^ if and 
only if the integers p, q^ p', q' are such that 

pq'>p'q. 

Similarly, p/q is less than p' /q', if and only if 
pq' <p'q. 

Thus I > I since 3 â€¢ 3 > 2 â€¢ 4. To prove statement (e) it suflBces to re- 
duce the two fractions which are to be compared to a common denomina- 
tor qq'. Thus we have f = t\ and f = r\, so that J > f because 9 > 8. 

(/) The tests given under ((i) and (*') alivays enable us to 
decide whether two given positive rational numbers are equal or 
not, and, in the latter case, to decide ivhich is the greater. 

{g} If no tivo of the three rational numbers p/q, p' /q'-, p" /q^' 
are equal, and if 

either p / q <:: p' / q' <p" /q" or p/q> p' /q' > p" /q" -, 

then 2^' /q' is said to be between p/q and p" /q". 

10. Addition and subtraction of rational numbers. Let 
aâ€” p/q be any rational number and let A be the corre- 
sponding point of the number scale. (See Fig. 4.) Then 
OA is a units long and we shall call the origin and A the 



12 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 10 

terminus of this line-segment OA. Let a'=p'/q' be any 
other rational number represented by the line-segment OA', 

whose origin is and whose 
k â€” -â€”a^a-i-a ^^^ >, terminus is A' . We now define 



5 li A' 'Y' addition as follows. 

To add a' to a ive first place the 
origin of the line-segment OA, which represents a, upon the 
origin of the number scale. We then place the origin of the 
line-segment OA', which represents a', 7ipon A, the terminus of 
OA. Let A" he the position which the terminus of OA' will 
then occupy. The liiie-segment OA" will then represent the 
sum a + a' . 

The arithmetic rule for forming the sum of the two 
rational numbers, ^/^ and p'/q', follows from this definition. 
On account of statement (c) of Art. 9, we may write 

(1) a=E = ^, a' = 4 = ^' 

q qq' q' qq' 

thus reducing the two fractions to a common denominator 
qq' . If we divide our original unit of length into qq' equal 
parts, equations (1) tell us that a con.tains pq' and that a' 
contains p'q of these smaller units. Thus their sum con- 
tains jo^-' +jt?' 5- of these smaller units, so that 

(2) p_^p[^ pq' + p'q^ 
q q' qq' 

since each of the smaller units is equal to the original unit 
divided by qq'. 

On the basis of the above definition for addition, or of the 
equivalent formula (2), we can now easily verify that the 
fundamental laws /, //, ///, IV of Art. 2 are true, not merely 
when the symbols there used stand for positive integers, but also 
if these symbols represent any positive rational numbers. 

The geometric construction for subtraction and the corre- 
sponding formula are so immediate as not to call for a 
separate discussion.

To multiply p/(i by l/q means the same thing as to divide 
p/q by q\ that is, to divide the line-segment of length p/q 
into q' equal parts and to take one of these parts. Thus 

q' q q'q 

We combine these two special cases into the following 
definition : 

To multiply a rational number p/q {the multiplicand') hy the 
rational number p' /q' (the multiplier) means to find a third 
rational number p"/q" (the product) such that 

(1) p1 = pL^p^i^. 

q q q q q 

In other words, multiplication of two fractions is carried out 
by multiplying the two numerators and the two denom- 
inators. 

It is easy to show, as a consequence of this definition, that 
the laws V, VI, VII, VIII, IX of Art. 2 will be true for 
positive rational numbers. If we combine this result with 
the statement at the end of Art. 10, we see that the nine 
fundamental laws of Art. 2 apply not only to positive integers 
but also to all positive rational numbers. 

12. Geometric construction for the product of two posi- 
tive rational numbers. The following familiar construction 
enables us to find the product of two rational numbers as a 
line-segment when the numbers themselves are given as 
line-segments.

any line OY, not coinciding with OX, and on OY lay oÂ£E

0U= 1 unit and OA' = a' units. Join U to A and draw a 
line parallel to AU through A'. Let P be the point in 

which the latter line intersects 
OX. Then OP will contain aa' 
units, so that OP will represent 
the product aa'. 

In fact, the triangles OAU and 
OPA' are similar, so that

This construction becomes especially convenient when OY 
is taken at right angles to OX. 



13. Division of positive rational numbers. According to 
Art. 11, the product of two rational numbers is again a 
rational number. The problem of finding one of these 
factors, when the other factor and the product are given, 
constitutes division. Let d = p/q be the given factor 
(divisor) and let I) = p'/q' be the given product (dividend). 
We wish to find a rational number x = p"/q" such that

But these two fractions, with equal denominators, can be

(2) (pq')p"=(p'q)q"- 

But, according to Statement (c?), Art. 9, equation (2) implies 
that the fractions jÂ»"/r^" and p'q/pq' are equal. Therefore

We have obtained the familiar rule for division of fractions,

which is usually expressed as follows : To divide hy the 
fraction p/q is equivalent to multiplyijig hy the reciprocal frac- 
tion q/p. For two fractions, such 
as p/q and q/p, whose product 
is equal to unity are said to be 
reciprocal to each other. 

It is easy to give a geometri- 
cal construction for division. To 
divide a by a' we lay off (see Fig. 
6) OA = a units, OA' â€”â–  a' units, 
0U=1 unit. We then join A to A' and through C/" draw a 
line parallel to AA', intersecting OX in P. Then 

OP = x = â€” units.

In fact, the similar triangles OPU and OAA' yield the

This construction, as well as our arithmetical argument, 
shows that division is unique; that is, two positive rational 
numbers, D and d, determine a unic^ue rational number as 
their quotient.

Let B be the point which bisects AA'. Then

(2) OB=h=l{a+a'^. 

But by (1) we find that 

2 -iKq q'J 2qq' 

is again a rational number, and it is obviously between a and 
a' . In the same way we may find another rational number 

between a and h, still another between a and 5', etc. Thus, 
hetiveen any two rational numbers, no matter hoiv close together 
they may be, there are always infinitely many other rational 
numbers. 

Therefore, the rational numbers give rise to infinitely 
many points infinitely close together on the number scale of 
OX, and in any interval on OX there lie infinitely many points 
(^called the rational points of the scale^ ivhose distances from 
are represented by rational numbers. This is often expressed 
by saying that the rational points of the scale form a dense set. 

15. The existence of irrational numbers. It is not true, 
however, tliat the distance from to every point of OX can 
be represented by a rational num- 
ber. To show this, let us con- 
struct a square (Fig. 8) on OA as 
a side, where OA = 1 unit, and 6 a b 
draw the diagonal ON. Then ^^^- ^ 

6N^ =6A^ + AN"^ =1+1 = 2. 

With as a center and ON as radius, strike an arc inter- 
secting OX at B. Then 

OW = 2. 



18 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 15 

Thus we have constructed a line-segment on OX whose 
length is equal to V2 units, if we use the customary notation 
for a square root. But we can easily show that V2 is not a 
rational number. For, if it Avere, we could write 

(1) v^ = ^ 

where p and q are positive integers without a common 
divisor, since we may think of the rational number to which 
V2 is hypothetically equal as being expressed in its lowest 
terms. jSIoreover q cannot be equal to unity. For if it 
were, (1) would require V2 to be an integer, and clearly 
there exists no integer whose square is equal to 2.* 

The prime factors (see Art. 6) of p are all different from 
those of q since, by hypothesis, p and q have no common 
divisor. The prime factors of p^ are the same as those of p, 
each of them occurring twice as often inp"^ as in p. Similarly 
for (f. Consequently every one of the prime factors of p^ 
must be different from every prime factor of <f. But from 
(1), if true ^ we can conclude 

2=^ ov p^=2q^ 

which latter equation tells us that p^ is divisible by q^, or in 
other words, that all of the prime factors of q^ are also prime 
factors of p^. We have reached a contradiction, thus show- 
ing that (1) is impossible. 

We have shown that the line-segment OB (Fig. 8) cannot 
be represented by a rational number. If we wish to speak 
of the measure of such a line-segment as a number at all, we 
must therefore introduce a new kind of number. These 
considerations lead us to make the following postulate: We 
agree that there shall correspond to every Ihie-segment on OJT, 
a positive number, ivhich shall serve as the numerical measure 
of that segment. The numbers which thus correspond to 
many of the line-segments of OX are, of course, rational 

* A formal proof of this follows immediately from the monotonic law of 
multiplication. 



AuT. 15] THE EXISTENCE OF IRRATIONAL NUMBERS 19 

numbers. Irrational positive numbers are defined as the nu- 
merical measures of those line-segments of OX which are not 
rational. 

Thus y/2 is an irrational number. 

We can now say that to every line-segment on OX there 
corresponds a positive number (rational or irrational); and 
conversely, to every positive number there corresponds a 
line-segment on OX. 

The geometrical constructions which have been indicated 
for finding the sum, difference, product, or quotient of two 
rational numbers can be performed whether the line-segments 
concerned are rational or not. Consequently these construc- 
tions maybe regarded as defining the sum, difference, product, 
or quotient of any two positive numbers whether they are 
rational or not. 

In formulating these definitions, we have presupposed certain notions 
of Geometry. Since every definition is an explanation of something in 
terms of something else, not all things are definable. The most funda- 
mental notions of a mathematical science are those which are not defined, hut 
upon which all of the later definitions are based. It is possible to define 
irrational numbers by purely arithmetical considerations (without the 
use of Geometry), but those definitions, due to Dedekixi),^ Cantor,^ 
and VV^EiERSTRASs,^ are too abstract and difficult for a beginner. 

The existence of irrational numbers is seen to correspond to the 
existence of incommensurable line-segments. It is a very remarkable 
fact that this was known to the Greeks at a very early time. The dis- 
covery is usually ascribed to Pythagoras.^

are given line-segments, it is possible to find a ruler and compass con- 
struction for any line-segment which can be obtained from a, h, c, d, etc. 
by a finite number of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, 
and extractions of square roots. 

16. Negative numbers and zero. If we prolong the line OX 
backward from in the direction OX' (see Fig. 9), we may 

lay off line-segments, such as OC 

x' < , I, I ' "^1 \ "^' X and OB' , in either of two opposite 

p,j^ q directions. These segments differ, 

not only in length, but also in 
direction. We agree to indicate this difference hi direction hy 
the use of the signs + ayid â€” . 

Thus we say that the number which corresponds to OC is -|- 3 and 
that which corresponds to OB' is â€” 2. 

The new numbers (such as â€” 2) which are introduced in 
this way are called negative numbers. If we agree further 
that the line-segment 00, of no length, which joins to itself, 
shall be represented by the symbol or number (zero), 
every line-segment of X' X which has as origin ivill determine 
a number, positive^ zero, or negative, according as the terminus 
of this line-segment is to the right of 0, coincides with 0, or is to 
the left of 0. 

Every point P of XX' may be thought of as the terminus 
of a line-segment OP which has as its origin. If we label 
the point P with the positive or negative number whicli cor- 
i-esponds to tlie segment OP, we obtain a scale of positive and 
negative numbers, as in Fig. 9. A familiar instance of such 
a scale is furnished by an ordinary thermometer. It makes no 
essential difference on which side of the scale we mark the 



Art. 17] DIRECTED LINES 21 

positive numbers, provided we use the opposite side for the 
negative numbers. 

We have iutroduced positive and negative numbers to indicate opposi- 
tion in direction, such opposition as is expressed in ordinary language by 
the terms right and left, above and below, north and south, east and icest. 
But there are many other instances where a similar kind of opposition is 
to be indicated, although not of geometric character, and where the use 
of negative numbers is of great importance. A few examples of this are 
indicated by the terms, before and after, temperatures above and below zero, 
profit and loss, credit and debit. If one of the members of any of these 
pairs be represented by a positive number, the other member may be 
represented by a negative number. 

17. Directed lines and directed line-segments. When a 
line XX' has been provided with a scale of positive and nega- 
tive numbers, as in Art. 16, we shall henceforth speak of it 
as a directed line, its positive sense being that one which is 
directed from the origin toward the side which represents 
the positive numbers. In our figures we shall, from now 
on, indicate the positive sense of a directed 
line by placing a + sign near the end of that 
portion of the line which actually appears in 
the figure. (See Fig. 10.) 

A line-segment is a finite portion of a line and may be 
described by naming its end-points, such as AB in Fig. 10. 
But if we think of it as a directed line-segment we must dis- 
tinguish between AB and BA. We may think of a directed 
line-segment as being generated by the motion of a poinU which 
moves from one of its end-points toward the other without ever 
changing the direction of its motion. That end of the directed 
line-segment from which the generating point starts its 
motion is called the origin of the directed line-segment. 
The other end-point is called its terminus. In speaking of 
a directed line-segment we shall name its origin first. Thus, 
in Fig. 10, AB is the directed line-segment which has A as 
origin and B as terminus. The directed line-segment BA 
has the same length as AB, l)ut the opposite direction. 

If a directed line-segmeiil lies on a directed line, its direc- 
tion or sense may be the same as that of the directed line or 




22 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 17 

else opposite. A directed line-segment, which lies on a di- 
rected line, shall be regarded as having a positive or negative 
number as its measure according as it has the same direction as 
the directed line or the opposite direction. 

Thus ill Fig. 10, if the length of AB is 5 units, we may write AB = 5 
and BA â€” â€” 5. The measure of vIjB is 5, that of BA is â€” 5. We shall 
use the same symbol ^.6 to represent both the line-segment itself and 
its measure. 

The absolute value of a line-seg7nent, or its numerical value, is 
always a positive number expressing how many units there are 
in its leyigth. We use the notation \ AB \, placing AB between 
two vertical lines, to represent the absolute value of AB. 

Thus in Fig. 10, \AB\ = 5, and \BA\^ 5. The first of these state- 
ments is read : the absolute value oi AB is equal to 5. 

A directed line-segment on a directed line is said to be in its 
standard position if the origin of the line-segment coincides with 

the origin of the scale. 

In Fig. 11, the directed line-segment 
AB, whose measure is + 3, is not in its 
standard position. If it be placed in 
standard position it will coincide with 

OC. Its measure will still be + 3. This remark also illustrates the 

following statement. 

Two directed line-segments on the same directed line have the 
same measure if their lengths and senses are the same. Two 
such segments will henceforth be regarded as equal whether 
their origins coincide or not. 

From what has been said it is clear that, if A and B are 
two points on a directed line, the measures of the directed 
line-segments AB and BA will be numerically equal, but 
opposite in sign, that is, 

(1) AB=- BA. 

The following theorem is also important. If A, B, C are 
any three points on a directed line, then 

(2) AB + BC=AC, 




Art. 17] 



DIRECTED LINES 



23 



where AB^ B (7, and A are the measures of the corresponding 
directed line-segments. 

Proof. The symbol + in equation (2) is used to indicate 
addition as defined geometrically on page 12, and again on 
page 24. According to this definition, to obtain the sum of 
two directed line-segments we place the origin of the second 
segment on the terminus of the first, and then join the origin 
of the first segment to the terminus of the second. If we 
apply this definition to the sum AB + BO we obtain AC, no 
matter in wliat order the three points A, B, and O are ar- 
ranged on the line. Thus the theorem is 
proved. 

Figure 12 shows three of the six possible arrange- 
ments of the three points, namely those three in 
which the measure of AC is positive. Fig. 12 (a), 
in which AB and BC also have positive measures, 
teaches us nothing new. In Fig. 12 (i), AB and 
CB are positive, but BC is negative. According 
to our theorem, which is true in all cases, we have 
AB +BC ^AC. But Fig. 12 (i) shows that 
AB â€” CB = AC. Therefore we obtain the same 
result whether we add to AB the negative segment 
BC or subtract from AB the positive segment CB. 
suit from Fig. 12 (c). 

The following is a simple corollary of the above theorem. 

J^ A, B, (7, JD are any four points of a directed line., tve have 

the relation 

(3) AB+BC+ OB = AI) 

between the measures of the directed line-segments AB., BC, 
CD, and AD. 

In fact, by the theorem just proved, we have 

AB + BC=AC AC+ CD = AD, 

so that we find by addition 

AB + BC-{-AC+CD = AC+AD 

which reduces to (3) if we subtract AC from both members.

18. Addition and subtraction of positive and negative num- 
bers. The fundamental operations of arithmetic have been 
defined, so far, only for positive numbers. These definitions 
may, in part, be applied without essential change to the case 
where some or all of the numbers involved are negative. 
But since nothing was said, at the time, concerning such 
cases, it becomes necessary to re-define these operations so 
as to take into account all of the possibilities. 

We define addition geometrically, as follows : 

To add a number a' to a number a, we first construct two 
directed line-sec/ments OA and O'A' on a directed line I, such 
that the measures of OA and O'A' are equal to the numbers a 
and a' respectively. We then place the origin 0' of O'A' upon 
the terminus A of OA. The directed line-segment OA', which 
joins the origin of the first segment to the terminus of the 
second, will have a -{- a' as its measure. 

In each of the cases represented in Fig. 13, OA' represents the sum of 

OA and O'A'. Jn all three cases OA is positive. In the first case O'A' 

is also positive. In the second case O'A' is nega- 

+1 tive but of absolute value less than OA, so that the 

+1 sum OA' is positive. In the third case O'A' is 

+i negative and numerically greater than OA, so that 

the sum OA' = OA +- O'A' is negative. 

This definition enables us to prove easily that addition of 
numbers (positive or negative) still satisfies the first three 
fundamental laws of Art. 2, that is, addition gives a unique 
result, it is commutative and associative. The question 
whether addition is also monotonie will be discussed a little 
later. 

If the sum s of two numbers and one of the numbers a 
are given, the problem to find the other, a', may be expressed

Art. 18] ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION 25 

as follows: wliat number added to a will give the sum Â«? 
We usually write 

(1) a' = sâ€”a 

and speak of the process of finding a' as subtraction. Â« is 
called the minuend, a the subtrahend, and a' the difference. 
As long as we dealt with positive numbers only, subtraction 
was impossible when the subtrahend was greater than the 
minuend. The introduction of negative numbers frees us 
from this restriction. 

Thus in Fig. 13, let the directed line-segment OA' repre- 
sent the minuend, and OA the subtrahend. Then, according 
to (3) of Art. 17, we have in all cases 

OA + AA' = OA' or OA + O'A' = OA' 

so that we must add O'A' to OA (the subtrahend) in order 
to obtain OA' (the minuend) as a sura. Therefore O'A' is 
the required difference, that is, 

(2) O'A' = OA' - OA. 

After a slight change of notation we may formulate this re- 
sult in the form of a geometric rule for subtraction. 

To subtract a number a' (subtrahend^ from a number a 
(minuend) we first construct two directed line-segments OA and 
O'A' on a directed line I, such that the measures of OA and 
O'A' are equal to a and a' respectively . We then place the 
termini of these two segments so that they shall coincide. The 
directed line-segment which theri joins the origin of the minuend 
to the origi^i of the subtrahend will represent the difference iii 
magnitude and sign. 

These constructions easily lead to the following familiar 
remarks. 

27ig addition of a negative number is equivalent to the sub- 
traction of a positive number of the same absolute value., that is., 

(1) a + (-5)=a-6. 



26 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 19 

The subtraction of a negative number is equivalent to the 
addition of a positive number of the same absolute value, that is, 

(2) a-(-5)=a+5. 

Since subtraction of any number may tlierefore always be 
regarded as addition of a number of the same absolute value 
but of opposite sign, we may from now on suppress any ex- 
plicit mention of the laws of subtraction. They are included 
in the laws of addition. 

The following statements are also immediate consequences 
of our geometric definitions : 

(3) a -\- = a, a â€” = a, a â€” a = 0, Â« + (â€” a)=0. 

19. Multiplication of positive and negative numbers. We 

have, so far, defined multiplication only for the case where 
both factors are positive. In our attempt to formulate an 
appropriate definition for multiplication for the case where 
one or both factors are negative, we return for a moment to 
the simplest case of all when both factors are positive in- 
tegers. In that case multiplication reduces to a repeated 
addition. Thus, for instance, 

(1) . 5 X 3 = 5 -h 5 -f- 5 = 15. 

If the multiplicand is negative, equal to â€” 5 for instance, 
while the multiplier is a positive integer, we naturally ex- 
tend this by saying that â€” 5 multiplied by 3 shall mean 
â€” 5 â€” 5 â€” 5, that is, 

(2) (_ 5) . 3 = - 5 - 5 - 5 = - 15. 

If the multiplier is negative, it becomes impossible to think 
of multiplication as repeated addition. But we know that 
if both factors are positive, multiplication is commutative 
so that 5 â€¢ 3 = 3 â€¢ 5. If multiplication is to be defined in 
suph a way as to remain commutative, even if one factor 
is negative, we must liave 

(3) 3.(-5) = (-5).3 



Aht. 19] MULTIPLICATION OF NUMBERS 27 

and therefore, on account of (2) 

(4) 3.(-5) = -15. 

Let us now think of these numbers as the measures of 
directed line-segments. In cases (1) and (2) the multiplier 
is positive (equal to + 3), and the ec^uations show that the 
multiplication by the positive multiplier 8 merely stretches 
the line-segment which represents the multiplicand in the 
ratio of 3 : 1 without altering its direction. For a positive 
multiplier, the product has the same sign as the multiplicand. 
But (4) shows that multiplication by â€” 5 not merely 
stretches the line-segment in the ratio 5 : 1 but also reverses 
its direction. These remarks suggest the following defini- 
tion of multiplication for positive or negative numbers : 

To multiply a directed line-segment a, of a directed line, by 
a positive line-segment b, we merely stretch a in the ratio of 
5:1. To mtdtiply a by a negative line-segment 6, we stretch 
a in the ratio of \b\'. 1 and also turn the resulting line- 
segment around through tivo right angles, thus reversing its 
direction. 

We may re-formulate the substance of this definition with- 
out any reference to Geometry as follows : 

T/ie numerical value of a product of two factors is equal to 
the product of the numerical values of the factors. The sign of 
the product is plus if both factors have the same sign, and minus 
if the signs of the ttvo factors are opposite. 

This statement includes the familiar rules expressed by 
the symbolic equations 

(5) ( + )(+)= -f, (-)(-)=+, ( + )(_) = _, 

(-)( + ) = -. 

It should be noted that these rules have not been proved. 
They are a part of the definition of multiplication. 

Our definition of multiplication is completed by consider- 
ing the case where one factor is equal to zero. 



28 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 20 

If one of the factors of a product is equal to zero, the product 
is also equal to zero, that is, 

(6) a X = X a = 0. 

If a product is equal to zero, at least one of its factors- must 
vanish. 

For our definition of multiplication gives us a non-vanishing product 
whenever both factors are different from zero. Consequently both factors 
cannot be different from zero if the product is zero. 

The geometric construction for multiplication given in 
Art. 12 becomes applicable also to the case where one or 
both factors may be negative, if we think of the lines OX and 
Oy as directed lines and lay off the line-segments which 
represent the factors in one direction or another upon OX 
and OY according to their signs. It will usually be most 
convenient for this purpose to draw OX and OY at right 
angles to each other. 

20. Division by a positive or negative divisor. As in the 

case of positive numbers, we think of division as the opera- 
tion inverse to multiplication. That is, if D is the dividend, 
d the divisor, and q the quotient, the problem involved in 

the statement ._, , 

V ^ d = q 

is that of finding a number q such that 

d q = D, 

where d and D are given. We have seen how to solve this 
problem, both arithmetically and geometrically, if D and d 
are both positive. From what was said in Art. 19 about 
multiplication it appears immediately that the following rule 
will hold : 

To divide D hy d where either or both numbers may be nega- 
tive, first proceed as though both were positive. Then give the 
quotient the plus or minus sign according as D and d have the 
same sign or opposite signs. 



Arts. 21,22] THE MONOTONIC LAWS 29 

21. Division by zero. To divide I) hy d means to find a 
number q such that 

(1) D = dq. 

If D is not zero and t? = 0, this equation involves a contra- 
diction. For, if rf = 0, the right member of (1) will have 
the value zero, no matter what may be the value of q^ and 
this contradicts the assumption that D is not zero. Con- 
sequently, the notion of a quotient formed from a non-vanish- 
ing dividend and a zero divisor is self -contradictor i/ , 

This contradiction disappears if dividend and divisor are 
both equal to zero. In this case, however, equation (1) 
will be satisfied by any number q whatever, so that the quo- 
tient is entirely undetermined if both D and d are equal to 
zero. Thus, the notion of a quotient formed from a zero divi- 
dend and a zero divisor, while not self -contradictory^ is useless 
since it gives no determinate result. 

In neither case can we make use of division by zero. For 
these reasons, division by zero must be rigorously excluded 
from algebra. Whenever, in any algebraic argument, we 
perform a division we must always either prove that the 
divisor is different from zero, or else we must state explicitly 
that our conclusion has been proved only for those cases in 
which the divisor is not equal to zero. Neglect of these 
precautions easily leads to the most absurd results. 

22. The monotonia laws for positive and negative numbers. 

The monotouic laws for positive numbers are concerned with 
inequalities and contain the symbols < and >. Before we 
can speak about the monotonic laws for negative numbers, 
we must extend the significance of these symbols so as to 
make them applicable to negative as well as positive num- 
bers. In order to do this, let us think of the scale of positive 
and negative numbers, and let tis think of a point ivhich moves 
along this scale in the direction from the negative toward the 
positive numbers. We shall then sag that a <. b {a precedes b, 
or a is less than 6) if this moving point reaches a before it 
reaches b. 



30 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 22 

Moreover, if a <ih we say also that h > a, that is, h follows a, or h is 
greater than a. 

In accordance with tliis definition we have, for instance, 3 < 5, â€” 2 < 0, 
â€” 5 < â€” 3, although 5 is greater than 3. 

It is now easy to see that, if we use the signs of inequality 
in accordance with this definition, addition will still be 
monotonia even though one or all of the numbers concerned 
may be negative. That is, if a> b, then a -\- c > b + c, whether 
a, 5, c are positive or negative. 

The monotonic law for multiplication.^ however., undergoes a 
slight but essential modification. If a > b, theti ac > be only if 
c is positive. If c is negative the conclusion to be drawn from 
a> b is, ac < be. 

Thus, from â€” 4 < â€” 3 follows â€” 8 < â€” 6 if yve multiply both mem- 
bers of this inequality by + 2. But if we multiply by â€” 2 we must 
change the sense of the inequality sign, since + 8 > + 6. 

The monotonic laws are essential in all questions involv- 
ing inequalities. 

Except for this slight change in the monotonic law for imdti- 
plication, the nine fundamental laws of Art. 2 hold for all posi- 
tive and negative ^lumbers. 

We have already proved this for the first three laws in 
Art. 18. The general validity of law IV has just been 
proved. The truth of laws V, VI, VII, and IX for the case 
of positive and negative numbers follows at once from our 
definition of multiplication, and we have just seen how the 
eighth law must be modified so as to remain valid in the 
case of a negative multiplier.

2 = L 

23. Directed line-segments in a plane. We have repre- 
sented positive and negative numbers by directed line-seg- 
ments on a directed line, which we shall henceforth call the 
r-axis. From the point of view of Plane Geometry, however, 
the directed line-segments of this particular line, the ^--axis, 
are of no greater importance than the directed line-segments 



32 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 23 

of any other line. We propose therefore to generalize the 
notion of a directed line-segment, by admitting that such a 
segment may be situated anywhere in the plane, not neces- 
sarily upon the a;-axis. 

We shall regard tivo directed line-segments (such as AB and 
A' B' in Fig. 14) as equal, if they have the same length, if 
they are on the same or parallel lines, 
and if they have the same sense. 

In applying this definition of equality, 

*-* we must take into account all of the three 

characters mentioned. Thus, in Fig. 14, AB 

and B'A ' are not equal although they have the same length, and are on 

parallel lines. Their senses are opposite. 

As in Art. 17 we may think of the directed line-segment 
as generated by a point which starts from one end-point and 
moves without reversing its direction, until it reaches the 
other end-point. Thus, we reach the notion of the origin and 
terminus of such a directed line-segment. In Fig. 14 the 
origin of AB is A, its terminus is B. 

. We may always construct a directed line-segment OP 
with its origin at the origin of the number-scale of the a^-axis, 
and equal to any given directed line-segment AB. (See 
Fig. 14.) We then say that the line-segment AB has been 
placed in its standard position OP. The length r of the 
line-segment is called its modulus or absolute value and is 
always a positive number ; the angle 6 which it makes with 
the 2;-axis is called its amplitude or argument. We see that 
two numbers (r and ^) must be given before we can regard 
the directed line-segment OP, or its equal 
AB, as known. 

There is a second way of describing such 
a directed line-segment. We introduce a 
second scale of numbers, just like the a:-scale, 
on a line perpendicular to the rc-axis through 
the point 0. We place the origin of this second scale (the 
y-scale) also at and place its positive end, as in Fig. 15, 
so as to be above the a;-axis. If now we project the directed

line-segment OP on the aj-axis and also on the y-axis, we 
obtain two directed line-segments, OM and OiV, to each of 
which will correspond as its measure a positive or negative 
number, on its own scale. We shall call these numbers x 
and t/ respectively. Their numerical values give the lengths 
of the segments OM and OiV respectively, while their signs 
indicate whether M is to the right or left of 0, and whether 
iVis above or below 0. (In Fig. 15, x and y are both posi- 
tive.) The numbers x and y are called the components of 
the directed line-segment OP. It is clear that any directed 
line-segment AB, which is equal to OP but 
which is not in its standard position, will 
have the same components as OP. See Fig. 
16, where OP and AB are equal directed 
line-segments, and where the components 
CD and UF of AB are equal to the com- 
ponents OM and OiV of OP respectively. 

If both of the components of OP are given, in magnitude 
and sign, we can clearly find OP itself by a simple construc- 
tion. Therefore the components of a directed line-segment 
determine it just as completely as its modulus and amplitude. 

If we are acquainted with Trigonometry we can easily 
compute the components when the modulus and amplitude 
are given.* From Fig. 15 we see at once that 

(1) X = r cos 6, y = r sin 6 

We have agreed already that the modulus r shall always 
be regarded as a positive number. It is desirable to define 
the amplitude a little more precisely than we have done so 
far. The amplitude 0, of a directed line-segment OP in its 
standard position, is the angle generated hy a line which origi- 
nally coincides with the positive x-axis and tvhich rotates around 
as a center., in a counter-clocku'ise direction (toivard the posi- 
tive y- axis')., until it coincides with OP. 

* Students who have not studied Trigonometry may omit those parts of this 
chapter iu whicrh Triijonometry is used. Alternative treatments are given not 
involving a knowledge of Trigonometry. 




34 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 24 

Therefore the amplitude need not be an acute angle. Thus, in Fig. 
17 the amplitude of OP is obtuse, that of OP' is in the third, and that 
of OP" in the fourth quadrant. 

For some purposes it is important to 
remember that the detinition of ampli- 
tude just given, does not determine the 
amplitude without ambiguity. The last 

â€ž words of the definition do not read : until 

Fig. 17 

it coincides with OP for the first time. 
Consequently we may add any integral multiple of 360Â° to the 
amplitude of a directed line-segment, and the resulting angle 
may still be regarded as the amplitude of that line-segment. 
Obviously we may now look upon the negative numbers 
of the a;-axis as corresponding to directed line-segments of 
amplitude 180Â° or tt radians. 

Thus the modulus of â€” 4 is 4; its amplitude is 180Â°. 

The truth of equations (1) for the case where 6 is an acute 
angle is evident from Fig. 15. But these equations are also 
true if is in any quadrant. That this is so will become 
apparent if we compare these equations with those which 
are used for the purpose of defining the sine and cosine of a 
general angle. 

Either from (1) or directly from Fig. 15, we find 

(2) r = + V.r2 + ^2, tan 9 = â€¢^, 

thus enabling us to compute the modulus and amplitude of 
a directed line-segment when its components are given. 
However, the second equation alone does not suffice to deter- 
mine 6 unambiguously as to its quadrant, since there are 
two angles in the first four quadrants (differing by 180Â°) 
which have the same tangent. However, since x and y are 
given, and r is positive, equations (1) tell us by inspection 
the sign of sin 6 and cos ^, and therefore the quadrant of 6. 

24. The complex numbers. We have seen that a directed 
line-segment, such as OF in Fig. 15, is determined in mag- 
nitude and direction by jneans of its components, x and y.

In particular, if ?/ = 0, OP becomes a directed line-segment 
on the rr-axis and may be regarded as representing a positive 
or negative number, as in Art. 16. If a: = 0, OP becomes 
a directed line-segment on the y-axis, and we might again 
associate with such a line-segment a positive or negative 
number. Unless we adopt some notation, therefore, which 
will enable us to distinguish at a glance between directed 
line-segments on the a:-axis and directed line-segments on 
the y-axis, the number + 3 might 
be thought of as a line-segment 
on either axis. In order to avoid 
this ambiguity, we label the scale 
of numbers on the ?/-axis with tlie 
symbols + i, +2 i, + 3 z, etc., 
â€” i, â€” 2 z, â€” 3 i, etc. (See Fig. 
18.) The four directed line-seg- 
ments OA, OB, 00, OD in Fig. 
18, all of length 2 but having different directions, may 
now very briefly be denoted by -h 2, -f 2 2, â€” 2, â€” 2 i 
respectively. 

More generally ive may noiv represent any directed line-seg- 
ment OP, ivhose componeyits are x and y, hy the symbol 

z = X + yi. 
Thus in Fig. 18, OP will be represented by 3 + 2 /, OQ by â€” 1 + 2 1.

Fig. 18 



A symbol of the for7n x -f yi, lohich may he regarded as 
representing a directed line-segment of the plane, is called a 
complex number. This complex number is said to have the 
positive or negative numbers x and y as its components. 

Thus a complex number is really a symbol involving a 
pair of ordinary numbers x and y. The numbers which we 
have considered so far might, by way of contrast, be called 
simple numbers. 

We may regard the symbol x + yi as a description of a path -which 
leads from to P. Thus, in Fig. 18, the symbol 3 + 2 Â« tells us to start 
at 0, to go 3 units in the direction of the positive ar-axis, and then 



36 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Arts. 25, 26 

2 units in the direction of the positive 7/-axis. If the x-axis points east 
and the y-axis north, we may regard the symbol i as an abbreviation for 
north and â€” i for south. 

25. Equality of two complex numbers. We have intro- 
duced the complex numbers x + ^i as symbols for directed 
line-segments of the plane, and we have agreed that two 
such line-segments are to be regarded as equal if they are 
of the same length, if they are on parallel lines, and if they 
have tlie same sense. The symbols for two equal directed 
line-segments will, therefore, be identical, since equal directed 
line-segments have their corresponding components equal. 
(See Fig, 16.) It is also evident that two line-segments 
which are not equal, in the sense of the above definition, 
will not have their corresponding components equal. 

These remarks lead us to the following definition of 
equality of two complex numbers: 

Two complex numbers, x + yi and x' + y'i, are said to he 

equal, if and only if their corresponding components are equal, 

that is, if ayid only if , _ , _ 

X â€” X, y â€” y. 

In particular, if x + yi = 0, then x= 0, y = 0. 

We see, therefore, that a single equation between two com- 
plex numbers implies two equations between their components. 

The discussion in Art. 23 shows us that a complex num- 
ber may also be said to have a inodulus and an amplitude. 
It follows immediately that two equal complex numbers have 
equal moduli while the amplitudes of two equal complex num- 
bers 7ieed not be equal; it suffices that the difference between 
them be an integral multiple of 360Â°. 

26. Vectors, vector addition, and addition of complex 
numbers. It remains to justify the use of the sign + in the 
symbol x -f yi. If we write the number x alone, we may 
think of a; as a directed line-segment OM on the a;-axis. 
(See Fig. 10.) We may, a little more concretely, think of 
OMnH a displacement which has the effect of moving a point 
from to M, and which moves every other point of the

plane through a distance equal to OM along- a line parallel 
to the a;-axis. Similarly we may think of yi as the symbol 
for a displacement which moves every 
point of the plane through a distance 
equal to ON along a line parallel to the 
y-axis. Now let us think of these two 
displacements as being made in succession. 
The first displacement, symbolized by x^ 
would move a point from to M', the second displacement 
would move tliis point, which is now at iHf, from M to P. 
Since the same result would have been obtained if the point 
had been moved directly from to P along the straight line 
path OP, we may say that the resultant of these two dis- 
placements is that one which is represented in magnitude 
and direction by OP. Conversely, the two displacements 
OiUfand OiVare called rectangular components of OP. It is 
customary to speak of the resultant of two displacements as 
their geometric sum. We may therefore actually regard 
X + yi as the sum (in this geometric sense) of x and yi. 

The actual relation between the magnitudes of the 
resultant and of the components is given by 

oP=6m^^-on^, 

as is evident from the figure. 

These considerations suggest the following generalization. 
Let OP and OQ (Fig. 20) represent two displacements. 
By virtue of the first displacement every 
point of the plane would move along a line 
parallel to (9P, through a distance equal 
to the length of OP, in the sense from 
toward P. The directed line-segment OQ 
represents in similar fashion the character- 
istic properties of the second displacement. 
It is clear that the resultant of the two displacements made 
in succession is again a single displacement, represented by 
Oi2, where OB, is that diagonal of the parallelogram deter- 
mined by OP and OQ which passes through 0. 




38 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 26 

If again we use the word sum, instead of resultant, we 
may say that the sum of the displacements OP and OQ is, 
the displacement OR. 

Let us now represent these displacements by complex 
numbers, z and z' . If the components of OP are x and y^ 
and those of 0'^ are x' and y', we have 

(1) z = X + yi, z' = x' + y'i. 

We see from Fig. 20 that the components of OR are x -\- x' 
and y -\- y' . Consequently we obtain the following result : 

If the ivord sum, ivlien applied to two displacements., he 
regarded as synonymous with the word resultant, and if the 
complex numbers x + yi and x' + y'i are used as symbols for 
two displacements ivhose components are (a:, ?/) and (x' , y'^ 
respectively, then the sum of these displacements is a displace- 
ment ivhose symbol ivill be the complex number 

X + x' +(y i- y')i. 

We are thus led to define x -\- x' -\- (^y + y'~)i as the sum of 
X + yi and x' +y'i, and we ivrite 

(2) X -{- yi + (x' + y'i')= x + x' + Cy + y')i. 

There are many instances of quantities which combine 
into a resultant in accordance with the parallelogram law 
illustrated in Fig. 20. If a steamer is moving 
north with a velocity of 800 feet per minute, 
and a passenger is crossing the deck walking 
eastward at the rate of 300 feet per minute, 
his actual velocity in space may be obtained 
as, in Fig. 21, by laying off a line-segment OB, 
800 units long toward the north, a line-segment 
OA, 300 units long toward the east, and completing the paral- 
lelogram which, in this case, is a rectangle. The number of 
units in OC (obtained by measurement or b}'" calculation) 
will give us the number of feet per minute which represents 
the passenger's speed in space, and the direction of 00, 
measured by the angle AOC, will give us the direction of the 




Art. 26] VECTORS, VECTOR ADDITION 39 

resulting velocity. Thus, velocities are compounded according 
to the parallelogram law. It is a familiar fact that the resultant 
of two forces attacking a body at the same point is also found 
by applying the parallelogram law, and there are many other 
instances of such quantities. 

Directed quantities, such as displacements, velocities, and 
forces, which combine in accordance with the parallelogram 
law, are called vectors.* 

By a proper choice of the units every vector may be 
represented by a directed line-segment, or, what amounts to 
the same thing, by a displacement. We shall, from now on, 
use the word vector instead of directed line-segment. We 
may then say, referring again to Fig. 20, that 

(3) vector OF + vector OQ = vector OR. 

Of course this does not mean that the length of OP -j- the 
length oi OQ is equal to the length of OM. In fact the figure 
shows that the length of OR is always either less than this 
sum or at most equal to it, the case of equality presenting 
itself only if the Vectors OP, OQ, and OR have the same 
direction. This simple remark may be formulated alge- 
braically as follows : Let 

z = X -\- yi and z' = x' + y'i 

be the complex numbers which correspond as symbols to the 
vectors OP and OQ, and let r and r' be their respective 
moduli or absolute values. Then r and r' are the lengths of 
these vectors, and 

r = Va-^ + y^, r' = Va:'^ + y'^. 

It is customary to uae the symbol \ x -|- yi \ for the absolute 
value or modulus of a complex mimber. The observation just 
made, that the length of OR is at most equal to the sum of the 

* From the Latin vector, meaning one who carries or conveys. The student 
should observe that the parallelogram law may be regarded as a generalization 
of the geometric definition for addition wliich was given in Art. 18, for the case 
where the line-segments OA and O'A' mentioned in Art. 18 are not situated on 
the same or on parallel lines. 



40 



THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 27

lengths of OP and OQ, may therefore be written as follows; 

(4) \x + i/i + x' + i/'i\ <\x + ^i\ -\- \x' + y'i \ 

where the symbol < is to be read either " is not greater than,'''' 
or "is less than or at most equal to.^^ 

It is apparent from Fig. 20 that tlie length of OM, that is, 
the absolute value of a; + i/i + a;' + y'i is exactly equal to 

(5) -y/{x + xy + iy + i/'y. 

27. Subtraction of vectors and complex numbers. If we 

have vector OP + vector 0^= vector OR, we say that 
Vector 0<^ = vector 0^ â€” vector OP, thus defining sub- 
traction of vectors. We regard the 
diagonal OM, and one of the sides 
OP of the parallelogram as given ; 
the problem of subtraction consists 
in finding the other side OQ of the 
parallelogram. The geometric so- 
lution is so simple as to make ex- 
plicit directions- unnecessary. See 
Fig. 22. The corresponding for- 
mula for the subtraction of complex 
numbers is just as simple. We find 

(1) (x + i/i) - (x' + y'i) = x â€” x' + (y â€” y')i, 

where x and y are the components of OR the minuend, and x', 
y' are the components of the subtrahend OP. The absolute 
value of the difference, that is, the length of OQ or PR, is

the unit of force used is a pound, find approximately, by a graphic solu- 
tion, the magnitude and direction of the resultant. 

28. Multiplication of a complex number by a positive or 
negative number. //' m is an// positive or negative number or 
zero, ive define the product m{x + yi) to he equal to mx +- myi. 
If m is positive, the corresponding product vector will be m 
times as long as the vector x + yi, but its direction will be 
the same. If m is negative, the direction of the product 
vector will be opposite to that oi x + yi. 

This definition is a necessary consequence of Art. 2fl in the case 
where m is a positive integer, if multiplication by a positive integer be 
interpreted as repeated addition. This same definition must also be 



42 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 29 

adopted in all other cases if we wish to define multiplication of a com- 
plex number by m iu such a way as to have it resemble multiplication 
of two positive or negative numbers in so ftir as to preserve the validity 
of the commutative and distributive laws iu this case also. 

29. Multiplication of a complex number by /. Tlie num- 
bers on the positive rr-axis were denoted by +1, +2, +3, 
etc. ; those on the positive y-axis by + i, +2 i, + 3 i, etc. 
This notation suggests the possibility of regarding 3 i as a 
product obtained by multiplying i by 3, a point of view 
which is entirely consistent with Art. 28. But we may also 
think of 3 i as the product obtained by multiplying + 3 by 
i ; in fact we must do so, if we wish multiplication by i to 
be commutative, that is, if we wish 3 x i to be equal to i x 3. 
If we adopt this point of view, we see that multiplication 
by i of any vector on the positive a;-axis, such as OM in 
Fig. 23, will produce a vector ON of equal length on the 
positive ?/-axis. We may express this by saying tliat mul- 
tiplication by i has the effect of turning the vector OM 
through a right angle in the counter-clockwise direction. 

If we wish to make a consistent use of this idea, we 
should agree that, to multiply ON by ^, means to turn ON 
+y also through a right angle in the counter- 

clockwise direction. But this operation 
would convert ON into OM', a vector of the 
M' o ~M^ same length as OM but having the opposite 
Fig. 23 direction. If OM is of length x units, we 

shall have these three vectors represented by the following 
complex numbers (see Fig. 23): 

OM by X, ON by xi, OM' l^y - x. 

But, since OM' was also obtained from ON by multiplica- 
tion with 2, we may also represent OM' by the symbol (xi)i 
or xi^, and the two symbols for OM' , x^ and â€”a;, will be 
identical if, and only if we agree that, 

(1) ^^ = ^â€¢2 = -l. 

Let us adopt this agreement, and let us further agree that, 
in all cases, multiplication of a; + yi by i shall obey the cora- 



N' 




Art. 29] MULTIPLICATION OF COMPLEX NUMBERS 43 

mutative, associative, and distributive laws of multiplication, 
so that 

(2) i{x + yi) = ix + ii/i = ix -{-yi^ = ix â€” y = â€” y + xi. 

Let OP (Fig. 24) be tlie vector whose components are 
a: = 6>if, y = MP. 

Let OP' be a vector of the same length as OP, obtained by 
turning OP through an angle of 90Â° in the counter-clockwise 
direction. Then OP' will make the same 
angle witli the y-axis which OP makes 
with the 2:-axis, and the triangles' OP'M' 
and 0PM will be equal. Therefore OM' 
= x and P'M' = y. The components of 
the vector OP' are M' P' and OM' respec- 
tively. If we denote them by x' and ?/', we shall have 

M'P' = x' = -y, OM'=y' = + x. 
so that the complex number which represents OP' will be 

^ -\- y'i = â€” y + xi, 

which, according to (2), is the same as i(x-{-yi). We have 
therefore the following result : 

If we assume that the operation of multiplying a complex 
number x + yi by i obeys the commutative, associative, and dis- 
tributive laivs, then i^ ivill be equal to â€”\ and such a multi- 
plication is geometrically equivalent to rotating the vector 
represented by x -f- yi through a right angle in the counter-clock- 
wise direction.

30. Polar form of a complex number.* Let r and 6 denote 
the modulus and amplitude of the complex quantity x + yi. 
We shall then have 

x=. r cos 6, y = r sin 6 (see Art. 23, Fig. 15), 

so that we may write 

(1) X -\- yi = r(cos 6 -{- i sin ^). 

Every complex number can be written in the form (1), wliich 
is called the polar form, or the trigonometric form of the 
complex number. The polar form is especially convenient 
when two or more complex numbers are to be combined by 
multiplication or division. 

31. Multiplication of two complex numbers. Let x + yi 

and x' + iy' be any two complex numbers, and let us form 

their product, assuming that the commutative, associative, 

and distributive laws are valid, and that i"^ is equal to â€” 1. 

These are the same assumptions which we made in Art. 29. 

We find , , 

(x + yi^Qx + y'i^ = xx' + xy t + yix + yiy i 

= xx' + xy'i + x'yi â€” yy', 
or finally 

(1) (x + yi) {x' + y'i) = xx' - yy' + (xy' + x'y)i. 

But this result may be expressed in a very simple form 
if we make use of the polar form of the complex numbers 
involved. t Let r and r' be the moduli, and 6 and 6' the 
amplitudes of the two complex numbers x + yi and x' + y'i 
respectively, so that in accordance with (1) of Art. 30, 

X + yi = r(cos 6 + i sin ^), 
x' -f y'i = /(cos 6' + i sin 6'). 
We find 

(2) (x + yi) (x' + y'i) = rr' [cos cos 0' - sin sin 0' 

+ ^(sin cos 0' + cos sin 0' )] .

But, according to the addition formulae, of the trigonometric 
functions, we have 

cos cos 6' - sin 6 sin 0' = cos(^ + 0')* 
sin cos 0' + cos sin 0' = sin((9 + 0'). 

Consequently we may write (2) as follows : 

(3) (x+7jiy(x' + i/'i)=rr'[co^{0 + 0')+ /sin (0+0'-)], 

so that tlie product is a complex quantity whose modulus is 
rr' and whose amplitude is ^ + 0'. We have proved the 
following theorem : 

Theorem I. If the associative, commutative, and distrib- 
utive laws of multiplication are assumed to hold for all com- 
plex numbers, the modulus of the product of two complex 
numbers is equal to the product of the moduli of the factors, and 
the amplitude of the product is equal to the sum of the ampli- 
tudes of the factors. 

We may express this in a different way. Let us speak of 
X + yi as the multiplicand, and of x' + y'i as the multiplier. 
According to (3), the product will be represented by a vector 
of length rr' making an angle + 0' with the x-axis. Now 
the multiplicand was represented by a vector of length r 
making an angle with the a:-axis. We shall therefore 
obtain the product vector from the multiplicand vector by 
rotating the latter through an angle 0' and stretching it in 
the ratio of r' : 1, where r' and 0' are the modulus and ampli- 
tude of the multiplier. Thus we find 

Theorem II. The product vector is obtained by rotating 
the multiplicand vector through an angle equal to the amplitude 
of the multiplier, and at the same time stretching the multipli- 
cand vector in the ratio r' : 1, ivhere r' is the modulus of the 
multiplier.

In Fig. 25, OP represents the multiplier, OP' the multi- 
plicand, and OQ the product. Let U be at unit distance 
from on the positive a:-axis. Then the 
angles UOP and P' OQ are both equal to 

6. and 

OQ: OP' = OP: OU, 

since 0U=1, OP = r, OP' = /, OQ = rr'. 
Consequently the triangles OUP and OP'Q 
are similar. This remark may be formu- 
lated as follows : 

Theokem III. If each of Uvo complex numbers he repre- 
sented hy a vector^ the vector ivhich represents their product may 
he found hy the following construction. Construct the vector 

Z7, of unit lengthy on the positive x-axis, the vector OP repre- 
senting the multiplier x -\- yi, and the vector OP' representing 
the multiplicand x' + y'i. Construct a triangle OP' Q similar 
to the triangle OUP. Then OQ will he the vector which 
represents the product (x + yi^(x' + y'i^- 

This last theorem may also be proved without making use of Trigo- 
nometry. Equation (1) shows that the product of x + iji and x' + y'i is 
a vector OQ whose components are 

x" = xx' â€” yy', y" â€” xy' + x'y. 

Let us compute the length | OQ \ of this product vector OQ. We have 

1 OQ I '^ = x"'^ + 7/"2 = {xx' â€” yy'y + {xy' + x'y)'^ = x'^x''^ â€” 2 xyx'y' + y'^y''^

+ y\x'^ + y/'2) = (x2 + 2/2) (x'2 + 2/'2), 
whence 



(4) \0Q\=^ Vx2 + y^ Vx'-^ + y'-\ 

But we have 

(5) \0P\= Vx2 + if, I OP' I = Vx'2 + y'\ 

SO that (4) becomes 

(6) 1 OQ I = I OP I â€¢ I OP' I, 

telling us that the modulus, \ OQ |, of the product is equal to the product of 
the moduli, \ OP | and \ OP' |, of the factors. 



Akt. 32] DIVISION OF COMPLEX NUMBERS 47 

To prove Theorem III we now refer to Fig. 25. The symbol of the 
vector OU h 1 + â€¢ i and we have | 0U\ = 1 ; we may therefore write 

(Q) as follows : 

^ ^ |(>(^1:10P| = \0P'\ : I Of/I. 

To prove that the triangles OUP and OP'Q are similar, it will suffice to 
show further that 

(7) \P'Q\:\UP\ = \OP'\:\OU\. 

Making use of the notion of adding of vectors (see Art. 2G, equation 
(3)), we have 

vector OP = vector OU + vector UP, 
vector OQ â€” vector OP' + vector P'Q, 

and therefore, 

vector UP = vector OP â€” vector OU = x + i/i â€” 1, 

vector P'Q = vector OQ â€” vector OP' â€” x" + y"i â€” {x' + y'i) 

= x" - x' +{u" - u')i, 
so that 

(8) \UP\= \^{x - 1)2 + ,/, \P'Q\= V(a:" - x')2+(?/" - >j'y. 

The components x" and rj" of the product vector were given by 

x" = xx' â€” yij', y" = xy' + x'//, 
so that x" â€” x' = (x â€” l)x' â€” yy', y" â€” y' =(x â€” l)y' + x'y. 

Consequently we find from (8) 
I P'Q I 
= V(x - 1)V2 - 2 x'y'{x - \)y + ijhf^ + (x - l)Y2+2 x'y'{x-\)y + x'-y''- 



= \/(x - l)2(x'2 + ?/'2) + y2(x'2 + y'-'^) = Vx"-2 + ^'2V(x - 1)^ + y% 

which reduces to 

(9) I P'Q I = I OP' \ â–  \ UP\ 

on account of (5) and (8). But (!>) is equivalent to (7) since | 0U\ = 1. 
Consequently we have now proved Theorem III. Theorems I and II are 
merely diffei-ent ways of expressing the same relations and are immedi- 
ate consequences of Theorem III. 

32. Division of complex numbers. If we define division as 
the operation inverse to multiplication, Theorem I of Art. 31 
gives us the following result without any calculation. 

Theorem. The modulus of a quotient h equal to the modu- 
lus of the dividend divided hy the modulus of the divisor ; the 



48 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 32 

amplitude of the quotient is equal to the amplitude of the divi- 
dend minus the amplitude of the divisor. 

We may liowever prove the same theorem by the follow- 
ing calculation. We have 

r(cos 6 + i sin 6) _ r(cos 6 -\- i sin ^)(cos 6' â€” i sin 6' ) 
r'(cos^' + zsin(9') ~ ?7(cos 6' + i sin <9')(cos 6' - i sin 9') 

_ r cos 6 cos 6' + sin 6 sin 6' + i(sin 6 cos 6' â€” cos 6 sin ^') 
r' cos^ 6 + sin^ ^ 

But cos d cos 6'' + Â«in 6 sin ^' = cos((9 - (9'), 
sin ^ cos 6' - cos ^ sin 6' = sin(^ - 6'^, 
cos2 (9 + sin2 e = \* 

Consequently we find 

,-1^ rCcos ^ + Â« sin ^) r r- .n /j^x , â€¢ â€¢ ,a m^-i 

<^1) -77 ^, . . - ^, =-[cos(^-6'^) + ^Sln(6'-^0], 

r (cos a' + z sm c'') r 

and this formula is equivalent to the above theorem. 

If the complex quantities are given in the form x + yi and 
x' + y'^, instead of in the polar form, their quotient may be 
found as follows. We have 

,.-,. X + yi __ X -{- yi x' â€” y'i _ xx' + yy' + (x' y â€” xy')i 
x' + y'i ~ x' + y'i x' - y'i ~ x'^ + y'^ 

This formula shows that the quotient is again a complex 
number x" + y"i, whose components are 

<-qN ,, ^ xx' +yy' f, ^ x'y-xy' 

^^ x'^ + y'^' ^ x'^+y'^ 

Of course x" and y" may be positive or negative. The}' are 
always definite numbers obtained from x, y, :c', and ?/', by (3), 
unless x' and y' are both equal to zero, that is, unless the 
divisor x' + y'i is equal to zero. Therefore, division by zero 
is excluded from the algebra of complex numbers just as ynuch 
as from the algebra of real numbers. Two complex numbers

AuT. ;5_>] OPERATIONS WITH COMPLEX NUMBERS 49 

always have a uniquely determined complex number for their 
quotient unless the divisor is equal to zero. 

The laws of multiplication and division of complex num- 
bers are used in many parts of applied mathematics. It is 
not feasible, however, to present any of these applications 
in this book because tlie preliminary notions needed from 
Physics are so complicated as to- necessitate a lengthy dis- 
cussion.

33. Real and imaginary numbers. The simple numbers, 
that is, the positive and negative numbers and zero, are often 
spoken of as real numbers. Of course, a complex number, 
x-\-yi^ reduces to such a real number when Â«/= 0, so that the 
real numbers are included among the complex numbers. Tliose 
complex numbers x + yi in which y is not equal to zero are 
frequently called imaginary numbers. 

The reason for this peculiar nomenclature is not hard to 
understand. No real number, positive, zero, or negative, has 
a negative square. Therefore, in the domain of real num- 
bers, an equation such as 
(1) a:2 = - 1 

has no solution. Mathematicians, several centuries ago, 
found it convenient, nevertheless, to treat an equation like 
a;2 = â€” 1 according to the same rules as were used for equa- 
tions, such as x^ = 2, which do have real solutions. This led 
to such symbols as Vâ€” 1. It was clear to them, of course, 
that the symbol Vâ€” 1 could not represent a real number 
(that is, a positive or negative number), and it seemed to 
them that this symbol could not be regarded as a number at 
all. To express all of these doubts these symbols, whose 
significance was not understood, were called imaginary num- 
bers, and the word still persists. From our present point of 
view, however, any complex number represents a real thing, 
namely a vector having a definite length and direction. And 
from this point of view the equation x^ = â€” 1 has two solu- 
tions. In fact we found in Art. 29 that the vector one unit 
long in the direction of the positive ^/-axis, which we called 
i, is such that i^ = â€” 1 and it is apparent that (â€” z')^ is also 
equal to â€” 1. Thus we see that the equation (1) is satisfied 
by 

'' X = I QV X = â€” I. 



Arts. 34, 35] VALIDITY OF FUNDAMENTAL LAWS 51 

We now see further that we may identify our symbol i with 
the symbol Vâ€” 1. 

The symbol Vâ€” 1 was, from the old point of view, not 
a real number, but something imaginary, and the letter i 
which we still use for it is accounted for by this fact. In 
the technical sense we shall still say that i is an imaginary 
number, meaning that it is not a positive or negative number 
nor zero. But it is, in our interpretation, just as real a thing 
as the numbers 4- 1Â» + 24, or â€” 3. 

Every complex number is of the form x + yi- We shall, 
henceforth, speak of a: as its real part and of yi as its imagi- 
nary part. If the real part of a complex number is zero, the 
number is said to be purely imaginary. 

34. Conjugate complex numbers. Ttvo complex numbers 

such as , â€¢ J â€¢ 

X + yi and x â€” yi 

ivhose real parts are the same, and for which the coefficients of i 
are numerically equal but opposite in sign, are said to be 
conjugate. 

The truth of the following statements is evident : 

The sum and product of two conjugate complex quantities are 
both real. In fact we have 

(1) (x+ yi^ + (x â€” yi) = 'lx, {x + yi)(x - yi) = x^-^ y^. 

The difference between two conjugate complex numbers is 
purely imaginary. 

(2) {x + yi) -i^- yi) = 2 yi. 

35. Validity of the fundamental laws for complex numbers. 
It is easy to verify that, with the exception of IV and VIII, 
the fundamental laws of Art. 2 are all satisfied, if the symbols 
there used to denote positive integei's are now regarded as 
standing for complex numbers. Laws IV and VIII, the 
monotonic laws of addition and multiplication, are not ap- 
plicable to complex numbers for the simple reason that 
complex numbers cannot be arranged in a simply ordered 



62 THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA [Art. 36 

sequence as is the case for real numbers. In other words, 
the fundamental notions " greater than " and " less than " 
have no simple significance for complex numbers. 

As a consequence of the facts just noted, we may manipu- 
late equations involving complex numbers according to the 
same rules as though the numbers concerned were real. For 
the monotonic laws have nothing to do with equations ; they 
are concerned with inequalities only. 

36. History of the number system of Algebra. The successive 
generalizations which have enriched the number concept, beginning with 
the primitive idea of a positive integer and leading up to the general notion 
of a complex number, were not obtained by sudden inspiration, but as a 
result of the painstaking work of mathematicians throughout thousands 
of years. Even our present method of writing numbers, the conven- 
ience of which can be appreciated only by contrasting it with the clumsy 
methods used by the Greeks and Romans, was the result of a long proc- 
ess of evolution. The most essential feature of this system, its positional 
character, was rendered possible only by the invention of a symbol for 
zero. It is usually conceded that the Hindu mathematicians of the sixth 
century a.d. took this step, although there seems to be some evidence 
that the Babylonians also had a symbol for zero. The characters 0, 1,2, 
etc. which we use nowadays are also supposed to be of Hindu origin. 
We usually speak of them as Arabic figures, because they were trans- 
mitted to the nations of western Europe through the Arabs, who had 
previously received them from the Hindus. 

The oldest mathematical manuscript with which we are acquainted, 
the so-called Rhind papyrus, written by the Egyptian Ahmes about 1700 
B.C., contains many calculations which involve fractions. P^xcept for the 
fraction 2/3 all of the fractions used by Ahmes were unit fractions, that is, 
such fractions as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc., whose numerators are equal to unity. 
The Babylonian astronomers introduced the system of sexagesimal frac- 
tions, which was far superior, for purposes of practical reckoning, to the 
system of unit fractions used by Ahmes. In this system every unit 
is divided into sixty equal parts, each of these is divided into sixty 
smaller parts, etc. The sexagesimal system was adopted by Ptolemy of 
Alexandria (about 1.50 a.d.) in his famous treatise on Astronomy, the 
Abnar/esi, and remained in general use for scientific purposes until the 
sixteenth century, when it was replaced by tlie modern decimal system. 
We still have important traces of the sexagesimal system in our reckoning 
of time and angles. Thus we divide an hour into sixty minutes, and a 
minute into sixty seconds; we also divide a degree of arc into sixty 
minutes, and a minute of arc into sixty seconds. 



Art. 36] HISTORY OF THE NUMBER SYSTEM 63 

As was mentioned in Art. 15, the discovery of the distinction between 
rational and irrational quantities is usually ascribed to Pythagoras. 
But Pythagoras and the Greek mathematicians who followed him made 
this distinction in an exaggerated fashion. They refused to regard irra- 
tional quantities as numbers at all, and did not introduce them into their 
Arithmetic and Algebra. Further progress in this direction was made 
possible only by the Hindus, especially by Bhaskara (1114 a.d.). The 
Hindus did not perhaps appreciate the fundamental character of this dis- 
tinction as clearly as the (ireeks, but they showed, by actual trial, that it 
was possible to use irrational numbers, and to calculate with them ac- 
cording to the same rules that hold for rational numbers. It was re- 
served for the nineteenth century to justify the procedure of the Hindus 
by a strictly logical theory of irrational numbers such as would have been 
acceptable to the Greeks. This theory is due to Uedekxnd, Cantor, 
and Weierstrass. 

Negative numbers also seem to have appeared first among the Hindus. 
Much later they gradually forced themselves also upon the attention of 
occidental mathematicians. Thus, we find that Leonardo of Pisa or 
Fibonacci (1180-12.50) accepts negative solutions of an equation in all 
cases where these negative numbers are capable of being interpreted as 
debts. The great Italian mathematicians of the Renaissance, Cardano, 
BoMHELLi (sixteenth century a.d.), and others followed Leonardo in 
this practice. They also began to use imaginaries in their calculations, 
although they regarded them with much suspicion. The geometric repre- 
sentation of positive and negative numbers as directed line-segments on a 
directed line was contained siibstantially in the famous Ge'ometrie of 
Descartes (1596-1650), one of the founders of what we now call Ana- 
lytic Geometry. As a result of this interpretation, it was generally 
recognized that negative numbers had established their citizenship in the 
republic of numbers. 

In the same way, complex numbers were regarded as mere phantoms 
and of no real significance, until an adequate geometric representation 
was found for them. This was accomplished independently in 1797 by 
Caspar Wessel, a Dane ; in 1806 by J. R. Argand, a French mathema- 
tician ; and finally in 1831 by C. F. Gauss.* The influence of the latter, 
who was probably the greatest mathematician of the nineteenth century, 
and the important applications which he made of complex numbers, finally 
established the complex numbers in the place which they have occupied 
ever since, as the only completely adequate number system of Algebra. 

* This is the representation upon which we have based our theory of complex 
numbers in Arts. 23-.34, and is frequently referred to as the Argand diagram. 
This representation defines a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the 
plane and the values of the complex variable x + yi. Consequently, a plane, to 
each of whose points there corresponds in this way a complex number, is often 
called the plane of the complex variable, or the Gauss plane. 



CHAPTER II 

LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS 

37. Constants and variables. When we have solved a 
numerical problem by the methods of elementary Arithmetic, 
we usually recognize that there are other numerical problems 
of the same kind which may be solved by applying the same 
methods. This leads to the formulation of certain rules, 
which state that in certain problems certain numbers must 
be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided. Algebra, by 
introducing the notion that any number whatever may be 
represented by a letter, such as a, 6, <?, x, or y, enables us to 
formulate such rules in a very concise manner. Thus, in 
Algebra, we focus our attention not on a single numerical 
problem, but upon a whole class of similar problems. The 
possibility of solving all examples of a certain class at once, 
except for the mere numerical operations involved, consti- 
tutes one of the advantages of Algebra over elementary 
Arithmetic. 

Thus, in Algebra, the rules of Arithmetic are replaced 
by algehraic formulce. In such formulse there are usually 
present some symbols (letters) which are intended to repre- 
sent fixed numbers, and other symbols to which various 
values may be assigned. Thus in the formula for the area 
of a circle 
(1) A = 7rr2, 

the number tt (approximately equal to 3.14159) is always 
the same. But formula (1) enables us to calculate the area 
of any circle. If r represents the number of length units 
(inches for instance) in the radius of the circle, then 7rr^ will 
represent the number of area units (square inches) in the 

64 



Art. 37] CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES 56 

area. Thus the letter r, in (1), may be thought of as 
representing any number whatever, afd we therefore speak 
of it as a variable. We may even think of r as being vari- 
able in a more concrete fashion. Let us consider a circular 
disk made of metal placed in a room of variable temperature. 
As the temperature rises, r will increase, tt will remain 
constant, and A will increase with r according to the law 
given by equation (1). 

A symhol which, in a given class of problems, is regarded as 
representing a fixed number, entirely/ incapable of change, is 
called a constant. 

A symbol ichich, in a given class of problems, may be regarded 
as assumi7ig different values is called a variable. 

Thus, in (1), A and r are variables, w is a constant. 

Equation (1) contains two variables, A and r, each of 
which is capable of assuming different values. But this 
equation states a relation between the variables, such that 
whenever the value of r is given, the value of A is deter- 
mined. We express this fact by saying that ^ is a function 
of r, in accordance with the following definition: 

If two quantities, x and y, are so related that to definitely 
assigned values of x there correspond definite values of y, then y 
is said to be a function of x; the variable x is called the inde- 
pendent variable or argument, and y is called the dependent vari- 
able or function. 

Ordinarily when ?/ is a function of x, a change in x will produce a cor- 
responding change in ?/. But it does not contradict the above definition 
to include the case when // is a constant as an instance of a functional 
relation between x and ij. In that case the values of y, which correspond 
to different values of x, are all equal. 

The distinction between constants and variables may also be looked 
upon as one of degree rather than of kind. A variable x may be capable 
of assuming all possible real and complex values, or only all possible real 
values, or only some real values, or in extreme cases, only one real value. 
It is therefore often cdnvenient to regard a constant as a special case of a 
variable, namely that special case where, on account of the nature of the 
problem, the variable can assume only one value. Moreover we shall 



56 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Art. 38 

often have occasion to regard one of the quantities, x or y, as unknown 
and we may not be able to state beforehand whether this unknown 
quantity may assume more than one value or indeed any value at all. It 
will therefore be wise to treat this unknown quantity as variable, until 
the solution of our problem has taught us whether it is a variable in the 
strict sense of the word or a constant. 

38. Variation. A very simple and important instance of 
a functional relation between two variables is furnished by 
the equation 
(1) y = mx, 

where m is a constant, and x and y are variables. 

Relations of this form occur very frequently in ordinary life. Thus 
if m. repi'esents the price of one pound of sugar and x the number of 
pounds bought, y = mx will be the cost of x pounds. If m is the rent of 
a house for one month, y = mx will be the rent due at the end of x 
months. 

When two variables, x and z/, are connected by a relation of 
the form y = mx, where m is a constant, y is said to vary as x. 

The same relation may also be expressed by saying that y 
is proportional to x, on account of the following theorem : 

If y varies as x, any two values of y are to each other as the 
corresponding two values of x. 

Proof. Let x^ and x^ denote any two values which x 
may assume, and let y^ and y^ represent the corresponding 
values of y.* Then we must have 

yi = mx^, y^ = mx^, 



whence 




yÂ±= 


mx^

oved. 







* The subscript notation Xi, x.2 is very convenient and will be used frequently 
in this book. We read Xj and x^, x-sub-one and x-suh-tioo respectively, x^ and 
x-i represent any two values which x may assume. The a;-part of the notation 
reminds us of the fact that each of these numbers is a value of x. The subscript 
or index indicates that we are thinking of ^, first and a second value of x. Thus r-< 
does not mean the same thing as x'^ {x square) . 



Art. 38] VARIATION 57 

The constant m which occurs in (1 ) is called the constant 
of variation, or the factor of proportionality. 

The symbol ac is sometimes used to denote variation. 
Thus y Qc a; is read y varies as x. The use of this symbol is, 
however, gradually becoming obsolete. 

If a variable y varies as 1/a;, that is, if 

m 

X 

y is said to vary inversely as x. By way of contrast we say 
that y varies directly as x, if 

y = mx. 

A variable z is said to vary as x and y jointly if 

z = mxy ; 

it is said to vary directly as x and inversely as y, if 

X 

y 

If we know in the first place that y varies as x and, in the 
second place, what value of y corresponds to a given specific 
value of a;, we can determine the constant of variation and write 
down the relation between x and y as an equation of the 
form (1) with a known value of m. 

Thus, let y vary as x, and let // = 30 when x = 2. Then we have 

y â€” mx, 30 = ?n â€¢ 2, 
whence m = 15, y = 15 x. 

EXERCISE VIII 

In the following examples determine the constant of variation and 
state the indicated relation as an eqnation : 

1. // varies as .?;, and // = 16 when .r = 2. 

2. y is proportional to .r. and // = (54 when .r = 4. 

3. -1 varies as r- and A = tt when r = 1. 

4. V varies inversely as p and r = 1 when p = \. 

5. z varies as x and y jointly and z = o when x = 2 and y = 3. 



58 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Arts. 39, 40 

6. z varies directly as x and inversely as y, and ;: = 10 when x = 3 
and ^ = -i. 

7. Prove the theorem converse to the theorem of Art. 38. If two 
variables, x and y, are so related that yi : y-^ =x-^ : x^, where (xj, y^) and 
(xj, y^) are ajiy two sets of corresponding values of x and y, then y 
varies as x. 

8. Prove the theorem : If z depends only on x and y, and if z varies as 
X when y remains constant, and varies as y when x remains constant, 
then z varies as x and y jointly when both x and y vary. 

39- Application to concrete problems. In most applications 
the numbers x and y represent the numerical measures of 
concrete quantities, such as lengths, areas, volumes, etc., and 
therefore depend upon the unit of measu-rement. 

Thus, if X represents the numerical measure of a length, we may have 
x = 4, or 48, or 4/3, or 4/5280 for the same distance, according as the 
unit employed is a foot, an inch, a yard, or a mile. 

Consequently, if x and y are the numerical measures of two 
concrete quantities^ and if y varies as x, the value of the factor 
of proportionality m tvill, in general, depend upon the units 
employed. 

The factor of proportionality will be independent of the units, only if 
X and y are the measures of quantities of the same kind. In such cases 
m will be an abstract number. 

Many of the measurable quantities which occur in Physics 
and Chemistr}', and in the applications of these sciences to 
Engineering, may be expressed in terms of length., time, and 
mass. We shall now discuss, very briefly, these fundamental 
notions and some others derived from them, so that the con- 
crete examples involving variation, which follow in Exercise 
IX, may become endowed with some real significance. 

40. Measurement of length. Let us use, as standard of 
length, a rod one meter in length divided into one hundred 
equal parts called centimeters. If there are no smaller 
divisions on the scale, such a standard will enable us to 
measure a given distance to the nearest centimeter. A 



Art. 40] MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH 69 

vernier* may be used to measure the fractional part of the 
centimeter which should be added. 

Fig. 26 represents two scales 5 and V, which are capable of sliding 
along each other. Let us think of the upper scale .S (wliich is divided 
into eeutimeters) as fixed, and the lower (the vernier scale V) as movable. 
If we wish to measure the distance between two points M and M' we 
may first bring the vernier scale into contact with M and read the 
division of the upper scale which is opposite to the zero point or index of 
the vernier, and then bring the vernier scale into contact with M' and 
read the division opposite to the index of the vernier when it occupies 
this second position. The difference between the two readings will be 
the required distance in centimeters. In Fig. 20 the index of the vernier 



BD 

I 3 



Fig. 26 

points to a place B on the upper scale between 2 and 'â€¢]. We wish to 
find out how many tenths of a centimeter there are in the distance be- 
tween the points marked 2 and B on the upper scale. The divisions on 
the vernier scale are closer together than those on the principal scale, each 
of the intervals being only 9/10 of a centimeter in length. Consequently 
the division marked 1 on the vernier will be closer, by 1/10 of a centimeter, 
to the division 3 on the upper scale, than was the zero point of the vernier 
to the division 2 of the upper scale. The divisions of the vernier scale 
approach the preceding division of the upper scale at the rate of 1/10 of 
a centimeter per division. Now (in Fig. 26) the division 7 of the vernier 
coincides with a division of the upper scale, so that it takes seven of 
these approaches to reduce this distance to zero. Therefore the distance 
from 2 to B on the upper scale must be â– ^^J of a centimeter or 7 milli- 
meters. Thus the reading is 2.7 centimeters when the vernier is in 
contact with M. 

In order to formulate this theory in general, let the prin- 
cipal scale be w + 1 units long, and let the vernier scale, n 
units long, be divided into n + 1 equal parts so that each 

* So named after Pierre Vernier (1.580-1637), born at Ornans in France. 
The instrument is also frequently called a nonius after Pedro Nunez (1492-1577), 
a Portut^uese, professor of mathematics at Coimbra, whose invention was based on 
the same principle, but was not quite so convenient. 



60 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Art. 40 

division of the vernier scale has a length of nj (n -f 1) units. 
(In our example w = 9, and the unit is one centimeter.) 
I^et the zero point (index) of the vernier fall between the 
divisions a and a -|- 1 of the principal scale. (In our ex- 
ample a =2.) The scale reading will then be a 4- a; where 
a: is a proper fraction which is to be found. (In Fig. 26, x 
is the distance 2 B^ and 1 â€” a; is the distance 3 ^.) Suppose 
that the division h of the vernier scale is the first one which 
coincides with a division of the principal scale, at the point 
(7 of Fig. 26. (In our example A:= 7.) Then the distance 
^(7 contains k vernier units, so that 

(1) BC= ^^ 



w4- 1 



On the other hand, there will be A; â€” 1 complete divisions of 
the principal scale between B and (7 (in our example 
A- â€” 1 = 6), and a fractional part of a division, marked BB in 
Fig. 26, which is equal to \ â€” x. Therefore we may also 
write 

(2) BC^X-x + h-X^k-x. 

If we equate the two values, (1) and (2), of BG^ we find 

kn _-, 

â€” â€” K â€” x, 

w + 1 

whence hn = (w + V)kâ€” (n + l^x = nk + k â€” (^n -\- l)a:, 
or 

(3) x= ^ 



n + 1 ' 

a result which verifies the conclusion drawn in the illustrative 
example. We obtain the following general theorem about 
verniers : 

Let the principal scale be n + 1 units long^ and let the vernier 
scale of length n units be divided into n + 1 equal parts. If 
the index of the vernier falls betwee/i tivo divisions., a and a + 1, 
of the principal scale, and if the division k of the vernier is the 



Aim. n] ij-:x(;rii, area, and volume 61 

first which coincides ivith a dividon of the principal scale, then 
the index of the vernier points to the place 

h 

a + 



M + 1 

on the principal scale. 

Thus a veniitT may 1>p constructed to enable us to read any kind of 
subdivisions not indicated on tlie principal scale. Moreover, the two 
scales may be circular; the ]n-inciple remains uncihanged. Consequently 
verniers may also be employed in tlie measurement of angles, and, in fact, 
this is one of their most important applications. 

41. Length, area, and volume. The result of measuring a 
length is expressed by saying that the required distance d 
contains x units of length, or briefly 

(1) d = x- L, 

if L denotes the unit of length. In this equation x is an 
abstract number and the product xL represents a length only 
on account of the presence of the factor L. 

Areas and volumes are usually determined, not by direct 
measurement, but by calculation from certain lengths. As 
unit of area we usually select a square, represented by I?, 
whose side is the unit of length ; and the numerical measure 
of any area is an abstract number which tells us how many 
times the unit area is contained in the given one. Thus, 
any area may be regarded as a product of the form 

(2) A=x-U 

where x is an abstract number and where X^, the unit of 
area, is a square whose side is X, the unit of length. 

Similarly, any volume Fmay be regarded as a product, 

(3) V=x-L\ 

of an abstract number x and a unit of volume i^, a cube 
whose side is equal to the unit of length. 

Formulae (1), (2), (3) may be summed up by stating 
that the dimensions of a length, area, and volume are i, L\ 
L^ respectively. 



62 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Arts. 42-44 

These dimensional symbols make it very easy to change 
from one unit of measurement to another. 

Thus we may convert an area of 3 square feet into square inches as 
follows : g ^^^ ,^2 ^ g^^2 in.)2 = 3 x 144 (in.)^ = 432 (in.)^. 

42. Time. The fundamental and natural unit of time is 
the day. It is determined by the uniform rotation of the 
earth around its axis. The shorter units, hours, minutes, 
and seconds, are measured by the use of clocks, whose ap- 
proximately uniform motion is guaranteed by their mechani- 
cal construction. We shall use the symbol T to represent a 
unit of time. 

43. Mass. If two bodies exactly balance each other when 
placed on the two scales of a balance with equal arms, they 
are said to have equal masses. If any body be chosen as a 
standard, and if it takes m of these standard bodies to bal- 
ance another body, the latter is said to contain m mass-units, 
or else its mass is said to be equal to m. The unit of mass 
most frequently used in scientific measurements is called a 
gram. A gram is the mass of a cubic centimeter of water 
at a temperature of 4Â° Centigrade. 1000 grams or 1 kilo- 
gram is equivalent to 2.2046 English pounds. We shall use 
the symbol Mior tlie unit of mass. 

44. Density and Specific Gravity. The mass of a body de- 
pends upon the nature of its material and its volume. A 
body is said to be homoc/eneous if all of its parts are exactly 
alike. If a unit volume of such a homogeneous body con- 
tains p mass units, v unit volumes will contain pv mass 
units, so that we shall have 

(1) m = pv, 

if m denotes the total mass and v the complete volume of the 
body. 

The number p, which expresses the number of mass units in a 
unit volume, and ivhich is different for different bodies, is 
called the density of the body. 



Art. 45] VELOCITY 63 

Equation (1) expresses the fact that the mass of a homo- 
geneous body varies as its volume ; the factor of proportion- 
ality in this case is the density. Since we may write (1) as 
follows 

(2) P = -, 

and since the symbols for unit of mass and unit of volume 
are iHf and L^ respectively, we find the symbol M/L^ for the 
unit of density. 

Let us use the centimeter as unit of length and the gram as unit of 
mass. A cubic centimeter of water has (by definition of the gram) the 
mass of one gram. Therefore the application of equation (2) to a cubic 
centimeter of water teaches us that the density of water is 

(8) p-l_gÂ£am. 



(cent.)^ 

To find the density of water in terms of the units inch and pound, 
we use the relations 

1 gram = 0.0022 lb., 1 centimeter = 0.3937 in., so that (1) becomes 

o-ram 0.0022 lb. ^ao^i lb. 



P 



= 1 a'-^- ^ ^â€¢^"" "'â€¢ = 0.0361 

(cent.)s (0.3937)3 (in.)^ (in.)^ 



The ratio of the density of any substance to the density of 
water is called the specific gravity of that substance. Since 
this is, by definition, a ratio of two quantities of the same 
kind, the specific gravity of a substance is independent of 
the units of length and mass. It is a pure number and 
therefore has no dimension. 

45. Velocity. If a train makes a run of 120 miles in 4 
hours, we say its velocity is 120/4 or 30 miles per hour. 
More generally ; if a uniformly moving body describes a 
distance of s length units in t time units, it would, at that 
rate, describe s/t length units in a single time unit, and we 
call the number 
(1) ?=z>, 

the velocity or speed of the body. This formula gives v = \ 
when s = 1 and t = \. Therefore this definition of velocity 



64 LINP:AR functions and progressions [Art. 46 

includes also a definition of a unit of velocity. The unit of 
velocity is the velocity of a body which moves at the rate 
of one length unit per time unit. Therefore the unit of 
velocity will change if the unit of length or the unit of time 
or both are changed. Since, in (1), s is a length and t a 
time, the symbol for a unit of velocity is L/T. 

Thus we may write 

.,^ mi. .,^5280 feet ..,, 5-J8() feet ..p. n feet , , feet 
hour 60 min. 60 min. min. sec. 

From (1) we find 
(2) 8 = vt, 

that is, the distance described by a uniforndy moving body 
varies as the time. The factor of proportionality is v, the 
velocity of the body. 

46. Acceleration. Consider the motion of a train which 
has not yet reached its full velocit}'. At a certain moment 
let its velocity be 6 feet per second ; and five seconds later 
let its speed be 28 feet per second. Then the velocity of 
the train has increased 22 feet per second in 5 seconds, or at 
the rate of 4.4 feet per second every second. This is ex- 
pressed by saying that the average acceleration of the train 
in this interval of time is 4-4 f^-^^ P^^ second ])er second. 

In general, if the velocity of a body is measured by v 
velocity units at a certain time, and by v' velocity units 
after t time units have elapsed, the velocity has changed 
v' â€” V velocity units in t time units, that is, at the rate of 

0) ^" 

velocity units per time unit. This quotient is called the 
average acceleration of the body during this interval of time. 
If the change in velocity is the same for every second of this 
time interval, the average acceleration is the same as the 
actual acceleration, and is said to be constant. 

If a body moves in such a way that its velocity increases 
by a single velocity unit in a single time unit, it is said to 



Akt. 47] UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION 65 

have unit acceleration. In fact, the expression (1) reduces 
to unity if v' â€”v is equal to a unit of velocity and if t is 
equal to a unit of time. If the units of length and time 
are a foot and a second, the unit of acceleration is that of a 
body whose velocity increases by one foot per second every 
second. Thus the train in the abuve example has an accel- 
eration of 4.4 acceleration units. 

Since a unit of velocity has the dimension L/T (Art. 45), 
and, since according to what we have just seen, a unit of 
acceleration is obtained by dividing a unit of velocity by a 
unit of time, the symbol for a unit of acceleration is L/T^. 

If velocities in a certain direction are regarded as posi- 
tive, those in the opposite direction will be regarded as nega- 
tive. If, in (1), V and v' are both positive and if v' is 
greater than v, the acceleration computed by (1) will be 
positive. If v' is less than v, (1) will give a negative result. 
Thus, for a positive velocity a negative acceleration has the 
significance of a retardation. 

47. Uniformly accelerated motion. Let us consider the 
case of a uniformly accelerated body, that is, one whose 
velocity changes by the same amount in equal intervals of 
time. Let us count time in seconds from a certain instant 
on, say 6 a.m., and let the velocity of the body be Vq feet per 
second, tQ seconds after 6 A.M. At any other time, t seconds 
after 6 A.M., let the velocity be v feet per second. Then 

.^. V â€” Vn change in velocitv 

(1) a = -0 = f : r-^ 

t â€” t^ time elapsed 

will be the average acceleration, expressed in feet per second 
per second, during the interval t â€” ^q. If the acceleration 
is constant, we sliall obtain the same quotient a from (1) no 
matter what value we use for t, provided v represents the veloc- 
ity at that instant. Consequently we find that the equation 

(2) v-v, = a(t-t,\ 

obtained from (1) by clearing of fractions, will be true for 
all values of t as long as the acceleration a remains constant. 



66 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Arts. 48,49 

That is, the change in the velocity of a hody^ which moves with 
a uniformly accelerated motion^ varies as the time which has 
elapsed. The constant of variation in this case is a, the con- 
stant acceleration. 

48. Falling bodies. The simplest instance, in nature, of 
uniformly accelerated motion is that of a falling body. The 
constant acceleration of such a body is usually denoted by 
^, and simple experiments, with the Atwood Machine for 
instance, show that the value of g is approximately 

(1) ^=32.2 ^^^\ â€ž 

(second)'' 

if the foot and the second are used as units of measurement. 
Let us begin to count time from the moment the body 
begins its motion, and let v^ be its initial velocity. Then we 
may put ^^ = 0, a = g, in equation (2), Art. 47, giving the 
equation 

(2) v = v^+gt 

for the velocity of a falling body at the erid of t seconds if its 
initial velocity (velocity at the time t = 0} is v^ feet per 
second. In this equation v and Vq are positive for downward 
and negative for upward velocities. 

If the body falls from rest, Vq is equal to zero. If it is 
thrown downward, v^ is positive ; if it is thrown upward, Vq 
is negative. 

49. The importance of dimensional symbols. â€” The illus- 
trations just given will suffice to justify the following re- 
marks. Algebra strictly speaking deals only with abstract 
numbers. Algebra may be applied to the discussion of con- 
crete problems only by introducing for every concrete quan- 
tity a certain quantity of the same kind as unit. In dealing 
with concrete problems it is very important to specify what units 
have been employed. Since it is often convenient to change 

from one system of units to another, we must learn how to make 
such transformations, and this is done most conveniently by 
means of the dimensional symbols. 



Art. 49] IMPORTANCE OF DIMENSIONAL SYMBOLS 67 

An equation between two concrete quantities is really an 

equation between the numerical measures of these quantities. 

â€¢ Such an equation implies equality between the corresponding 

concrete quantities only if they are quantities of the same kind, 

and if they are measured in terms of the same unit. 

Thus it is obviously meaningless to say that 40 feet = 40 square feet. 
We have here two concrete quantities whose numerical measures are 
equal. But this does not imply equality of the two concrete quantities 
themselves, because the latter are different in kind, that is, have different 
dimensions. 

We may also express this as follows : An equation between 
concrete quantities has a concrete (^not merely a numerical^ 
significance, only if all of the terms of the equation have the 
same dimension. 

This fact often enables us to find the dimension of a quantity which 
may otherwise not be apparent, as in the following example. A familiar 
law of Mechanics (see Art. 48) states that a body, falling from rest, 
acquires after t seconds a velocity of v feet per second, where 

(1) (â–  = :32.-2/. 

The left member (a velocity) has the dimension L/T and the right 
member seems to have the dimension T. But we have just seen that 
both members ought to have the same dimension. The cause for this 
apparent contradiction lies in thinking of 32.2 as an abstract number. 
The equation itself tells us that 32.2 is equal to v/t, and therefore is 
not an abstract number. It has the dimension of a velocity divided by 
a time or L/T-. A more adequate \\a,y of w-riting (1) would be 

(2) V - yt, 

where g is the numerical measure of a quantity of the dimension L/T^, 
and where the numerical value of g becomes equal to 32.2 only if the 
units of length and time are the foot and the second respectively. In 
fact g is the acceleration of a falling body as explained in Art. 48. The 
dimension of g now being known, we may find the value of g in terms 
of the units centimeter and minute, or in terms of any other units 
whatever.

3. The area A of a, circle varies as the square of its radius r. Ex- 
press this as an equation. What is the value of the factor of propor- 
tionality? Is it an abstract number? If not, what is its dimension? 

4. A glass beaker has a graduated scale upon it enabling an ob- 
server to read oft' the volume of fluid which it contains. By immersing 
spheres of various sizes in the fluid, it is found experimentally that the 
volume F of a sphere varies as the cube of its radius, and that V = 4.19 
cu. in. when r = 1 in. Express F as a function of r. 

5. The distance d (in miles) traveled by a train varies as the time t 
(in hours) counted from the moment of its departure, and d = 150 when

stant of variation, and what is its physical significance? How will the 
equation be modified if the distance is expressed in feet and the time in 
minutes? 

6. The number of feet s which a body falls (from rest) in / seconds

12. The safe load of a horizontal beam supported at both ends varies 
jointly as the breadth and the square of the depth, and inversely as the 
length between the supports. Plan some experiments to prove this Taw 
and state it in the form of an equation. Determine the factor of pro- 
portionality for a certain kind of wood, if the maximum safe load for a 
beam 15 feet long, 3 inches wide, and 6 inches deep is 1800 pounds.

13. The planets describe approximately circular orbits around the 
Sun. The time required for a planet to make one revolution in its orbit 
is called its period. For the Earth this period is one year. By compar- 
ing the distances and periods of the various planets, Kepler * discovered 
the following law, usually called Kepler's third law : in the solar system 
the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of its distance 
from the Sun. Express this law in the form of an equation, and deter- 
mine the factor of proportionality if the Earth's distance from the Sun 
be taken as unit of distance, and one year as unit of time. What is the 
distance of Jupiter from tlie Sun if Jupiter's period is 11.86 years? 

14. At the earth's surface a body falls 193 inches in the first second. 
The number of inches which a body not at the earth's surface, would 
fall in the first second is inversely proportional to the square of the dis-

earth's center to the moon is sixty times the earth's radius, how far 
would a body fall in the first second if it were as far away as the moon?

* JoHANN Kepler (1571-1(530), a famous German astronomer. Kepler's 
greatest achievement was the discovery of the three fundamental laws of planet- 
ary motion, the la^^t of wliich is quoted above. Tlie first of tliese laws asserts tliat 
a i>lanet moves in an ellipse of wliirh the Sun occupies one locus, and the second 
law states that the planet's radius vector sweeps over equal areas in equal times. 
Kepler obtained these laws by discussing the observations of the great Danish 
astronomer, Tyiho BKAnt:. Newton showed later that all these laws are con- 
sequences of tlie law of gravitation. 

t This is one way of stating the law of gravitation. The calculation indicated 
in this example was first performed by Newton. The result of this calculation 
did not agree as well as it shoulil with the observed motion of the moon on ac- 
count of the inadequate notions curreiU at that time in regurd to the dimensions 
of the earth. Newton therefore gave up the theory that gravitation varies ac- 
cording to the law of inverse squares uiUil a few years later, wlicii a new survey 
showed him a complete agreement with this theory. (See Grant's Hhtory oj

X and y, which are so related may be thought of as belonging 
together and constituting a pair. We shall now show how 
such a pair of numbers may be represented geometrically. 

Let us draw two lines, unbounded in length and perpen- 
dicular to each other. We shall usually think of one of them 
as horizontal and call it the x-axis, and call the other, which 
is vertical, the y-axis. The point 0, in which the two axes 
intersect, is called the origin of coordinates. 

We adopt a unit of length, and denote the 
distances from any point P to these two axes 
by X and ?/ respectively. In Fig. 27, we have 

NP=OM=x, MP=ON=y, 

where the notation is chosen in such a way 
that X is measured on or parallel to the a;-axis, and y on or 
parallel to the ^-axis. 

We call X the abscissa and y the ^^ 

ordinate of the point P. Both 
numbers together are called the 
coordinates of P. -j^ 

If we take into account only 
the magnitudes and not the direc- 
tions of lines OM^ ON, etc., that 
is, if X and y are regarded as 
numbers without sign, there will 
be four points which have the same co5rdinates. 

For instance, the points P, P', P", P'", in Fig. 28, would all corre- 
spond to X = 3, y = 2. 

In order to avoid this inconvenience, we introduce the 
convention that the abscissas of all points to the right of the 
^-axis shall be positive, and of those to the left negative ; 
that the ordinates of all points above the a;-axis shall be 
positive, and of those below negative. 

The coordinates of the four points in Fig. 28 are now different from 
each other. 

The coordinates of P are x =+ 3, y = + 2, 
The coordinates of P' are x = â€” B, y = + 2, 
The coordinates of P" are x â€” â€” S, y â€” â€” 2, 
The coordinates of P'" are x â€” + 3, y â€” â€” 2.

Art. 5(1] GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION 71 

The positive directions of the x- and yaxis, which have now 
been deiined, tvill hereafter he indicated by a plus sign (as in 
Fig. 28). 

The introduction of a coordinate system enables us to estab- 
lish a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the plane 
(^objects of G-eometry^ and pairs of real numbers (objects of 
Arithmetic^. To every loair of real numbers there corresponds 
one and only one point of the plane, namely that one which has 
the given real numbers as coordinates ; and to every point of the 
plane there corresponds a single pair of real numbers, namely 
the coordinates of that point. 

This method of representing a pair of real numhers by a point is, of 
course, closely allied to our former method of representing a single com- 
plex Dumber by a point. See Art. 24.* In fact a single complex number, 
z = X -{â–  yi, determines a pair of real numbers {x, y). It is merely a 
qnestion of convenience whether we wish to think of the points of the 
plane as geometrical representatives of a sbigle complex number, or of a 
pair of real numbers. 

We can not, however, represent a joair of complex numbers, or even a pair 
of numbers one of which is complex, by means of the points of a single 
lihine. If, therefore, in the solution of a problem which involves the 
coordinates of a point in a plane, we find that either of these coordinates 
receives a comi>lex value, we conclude that the required point does not 
exist. This in no wise contradicts the fact that a point of the plane may 
be represented by a complex number x + yi, for, in this symbol also, a; and 
y are supposed to be real. 

EXERCISE X

1. (+3, +4). 3. (-:3, -4). 

2. (-3, +4). 4. (+3, -4). 

5. If we know nothing about a point except that x = 0, what can we 
say about its location ? 

6. Write down an equation, involving one or both of the coordinates 
of a point P, which will be satisfied provided that P is anywhere on the 
y-axis. Will this equation be satisfied by any point which is not on the 
y-axis? 

* We represented a complex number x + yi hy a, vector, whose components 
were z and y. If this vector is put into its standard position, its terminus will be 
a point whose coordinates are x and y.

8. Write down an equation which will be satisfied it' and only if P is 
on the X-axis. 

51. Graphical representation of variation. If y varies as x. 
that is, a y â– = mx^ there are intinitely many pairs of values, x 
and y, which satisfy this relation. If we plot a large number 
of these pairs, we find points which seem to be on a straight 
line through the origin of coordinates. 

^ I Example. Let y = 2 x. For x = + 1, this gives y = + 2 ; 

for X = + 2, y = + 4 ; etc. For x = â€” 1, ^ = â€” 2 ; for x = â€” 2, 
?/ = â€” 4 ; etc. These results are collected in the adjoining table. 
If we plot these pairs of numbers (â€”3, â€” 6), (â€”2. â€” 4), etc , 
we obtain the points P_3, P_.^, P_i, P^, P^, P^, P^ of Fig. 29, 
which seem to be on a straight line through the origin. The 
idea naturally suggests itself that not merely the few pairs of 
numbers which we have calculated, but that all number pairs 
which satisfy the equation ij = '2x will give rise to points on 
We shall actually />?-ot'e that this is so in Art. 54. 



It often happens, especially in concrete 
problems, that m is so large or so small as 
to render the resulting graph practically 
useless. This may be avoided by choos- 
+x ing different scale units on the two axes. 
These scale units should always be specified 
in concrete problems, so as to make evident 
the concrete significance of such a diagram.

52. Graphical representation of the function y = mx + b. 
The metliod explained in the preceding article applies just 
as well to any equation of the form 

y = mx + h. 

We observe, in this case, that the locus of the points whose 
coordinates satisfy such an equation, again appears to be a 
straight line ; but this line does not pass through the origin 
unless h is equal to zero.

4. // = 4x - 2. 8. j^ := - 4,r + 2. 

53. Slope of a straight line. Let Pj and F^ be two points 
on a straight line, and let the coordinates of these points be 
called (a:j, y-^ and (x^^ y^ respectively. 
F'igure 30 shows that a point P, in mov- 
ing from Pg to Pj, will move x^ â€” x^ units 
toward the right and yi â€” y^, units upward. 
The ratio 

(1) m =^1 ~ ^2 F^Â«-^ 

is called the slope of the line. 

Thus, if a railroad track rises 3 feet in a horizontal distance of 
200 feet, its slope is = 3/200 = 1.5/100. It rises 1.5 feet in 100 feet; it 
lias a slope or grade of 1.5%- 

If the line P^P^ makes an angle 6 with the x-axis, Fig. 30 shows that 




(2) 



yÂ±ZJb = tan 6. 



Consequently, any one who has studied Trigonometry, may say that the 
slope ofn line in the tangent of the angle which the line makes tvith the x-axis. 

It is important to note that the definition of the slope, as 
given by (1), is independent of the choice of the particular 



74 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Art. 54 

points, Pj and P^, provided both of them are on the line. 
If we take any two other points of the line, Pg and P^, the 
value of m given by 

will be exactly the same as that given by (1). That this is 
so follows from familiar properties of "similar triangles. 
Moreover, we might write, instead of (1), 

(3) m = UiLZLli^ 

interchanging the order of the two points Pj and Pg. Since 

Vi- y\ = - iy\ - ^2)' 2^2 - ^1 = - (^1 - ^2) 

the values of m given by (1) and (3) are the same. 

Formula (1) may give a positive, zero, or negative value 
for the slope w of a line. The slope will be positive if the line 
rises from left to right as in Fig. 30. The slope is negative if 
the line falls from left to right. Tlie slope is zero if the line is 
parallel to the x-axis. In that case we have y,^ = y^, and we 
shall have 

(^) y = yi 

for every point of the line. 

A line parallel to the y-axis cannot he said to have any slope. 
For such a line we should have x^ = x^^ so that formula (1) 
which defines the slope becomes useless, since division by 
zero is excluded from Algebra. (See Art. 21.) It is clear 
however that /or every poiiit of such a line., the equation 

(5) x = x^ 

will he satisfied. 

54, Equation of a straight line. Let Pj 

(Fig. 31) be a given point and let us con- 
struct the line AP which passes through 
Pj, and which has the given number m as 
-+a; its slope. If (a^j, y^ are the codrdinates 
â– P^G' ^^ of Pj, we may then regard 2;^, ?/j, and m, as 




Art. 54] EQUATION OF A STRAIGHT LINE 75 

given numbers. If we denote by (.c, ^) the coiJrdiuates of 
any other point on AP^ we must have 

(1) . y^lJh = m, 

X â€” T-^ 

since the slope of AP miiy be computed, by formula (1) of 
Art. 53, in terms of the coordinates of any two of its points. 
Thus, if we regard x^^ y^, m as given numbers, equation (1) 
will be satisfied by the coordinates (x^ Â«/) of every point, 
different from P^, of the line AP. 

There are no other points, except those on AP^ whose 
coordinates satisfy (1). For, let P' (Fig. 31) be any point 
not on AP. If we substitute iU coordinates for x and y in 
the left member of (1) we shall obtain, not w, the slope of 
AP., but some other number equal to the slope of P^P' . 

Consequently, the equation obtained from (1) by clearing 
of fractions, namely 

(2) y-y\ = ^(^ - a^i) 

t's satisfied hy the coordinates of every point on the line AP * ; 
and conversely^ every point whose coordinates satisfy this equa- 
tion is on AP. We express this more briefly by saying that 

(2) is the equation of the line AP. Thus, the equation of a 

line which passes through the point (a:^, y^ and ivho><e slope is 

m, is 

y-yi = m{x-x^). 

Example. The equation of the line of slope 2 which passes through 

the point (3, 4), is 

jl â€” 4 = J(x â€” .5). 

If the given point P^ is on the ^/-axis, coinciding with B 
(Fig. 31), we shall have x-^ = 0, and we shall usually denote 
the ordinate of B by h. The number b, whicli may be posi- 
tive, zero, or negative is called the y-intercept of the line. 
Since we have x^ = 0, ^j = 6, equation (2) becomes, in this 
case, 

(3) y = mx + h. 

* Since (2) is equiv.alent to (1) for all points except Pi, and siuce the coordi- 
nates of Pi evidently also satisfy (2). 



*y 



76 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Art. 54 

Therefore, (3) is the equation of the straiglit line whose 
slope is 771, and whose y-intercept is h. In otlier words, 
tlie graph of (o) will be the straight line of slope 7n and 
//-intereept b. 

Tlie equation of a straight line parallel to the ?/-axis can- 
not be written in either of the forms (2) or (3), since the 
slope of such a line is not defined. (See Art. 53.) It is 
very easy, however, to find the equation of such a line. In 
fact we have shown already (Art. 53, equation (5)), that the 
coordinates of every point of such a line satisfy the equation 
X = x^, where x^ is the abscissa of some one point of the line. 
It is evident, conversely, that every point of 
the plane, for which x = x^., is on the line. 

Since x^ may, in particular, be regarded as 
the abscissa of the point A (Fig. 32) in which 
the line cuts the a:-axis, we mav say that the 
-^ equation of any line parallel to the y-axis may 

Fig. 32 he written in the form 

(4) X = a-j, 

where x^ is the x-intercept of the line. 

We have now actually proved what the examples of Exer- 
cises XI and XII seemed to indicate. The graph of any 
equation of form (3) or (4) is a straight line. We may 
express this in a little more general form as follows. Tite 
graph of any equation of the form 

(5) Ax + By+C=0, 

where A, B, C are any constants whatever, and tvhere x and y 
occur only to the first degree, is a straight line. 

To prove this, observe that equation (5) defines y as a 
function of x, namely 

provided that B is different from zero ; and this function is 
of the form (3), so that the graph of (6) is a straight line. 
If, however, B is equal to zero while A does not vanish. 



Art. 55] THE ZERO OF A LINEAR FUNCTION 77 

(5) reduces to Ax +(7=0, 

C 

which ffives x = -â€¢ 

^ A 

which is of form (4), and therefore has as its graph a line 
parallel to the ^-axis. We need not discuss the case A = B 
= 0, since we should then also have (7 = 0, so that all the 
coefficients of (5) would vanish. Such an equation would 
obviously be satisfied by idl values of r and y. 

Smce the locus of an equation of tlie form (5) is a straight 
line, it is unnecessary, for the purpose of drawing the locus, to 
calculate the coordinates of more than tivo of its poirits. 

On account of the fact that the graph of the equation 

y = mx + l> 

is a straight line, ever g function of the form mx + h is called a 
linear function. 

55. The zero of a linear function. The graph of the linear 

function , 7 

y = mx + 

is a straight line of slope m. This line 
will meet the a^-axis in a point A unless 
m happens to be equal to zero. (See Fig. 
33.) The ordinate of A is equal to zero; 
we wish to find its abscissa. Since A is 
on the line AB, the coordinates of A must satisfy the equation 

(1) y = mx + b, 

which is satisfied by the cocirdinates of every point on AB ; 
and, since the ordinate of A is zero, the abscissa x oi A must 
satisfy the equation 

(2) = mx + b, 

obtained from (1') by substituting in it y = 0. But (2) 
gives

provided that m^O.* If m = 0, equation (1) reduces to 
1/ = b, the corresponding line is parallel to the 2;-axis, and 
there is no point of intersection. 

The particular value of x, namely/ x = â€” h/m, which causes 
the function mx + b to assume the value zero, is called the zero 
of the function. 

The zero of the function mx + ^ is the same number as the 
solution or root of the equation 

mx + 6 = 0. 

Moreover, the zero of the function mx + b is equal to the 
abscissa of the point in which the graph of the function crosses 
the X-axis.

particular, distinguish between the three cases v' > v, v' = i% v' < v. 

19. The distance between two cities, A and B, is 180 miles. An auto-

21. An observer is stationed on a rowboat which is at rest. He 
notices that n wave-crests pass the boat in one second, and that each 
â– wave is propagated with a velocity of Ffeet per second. He then starts 
to row in the direction of the waves with a velocity of v feet per second.

How many wave-crests will pass the boat per second while it is in 
motion ? Answer the same question for the case when the boat is mov- 
ing with a velocity of v feet per second against the direction of the waves. 

22. Sound is produced by waves or vibrations of the air, and the pitch 
of a tone depends upon the number of vibrations which strike the ear in 
one second. Making use of Ex. 21, explain the following phenomenon. 
When a train passes a source of sound (a bell or a whistling engine), 
the pitch of the sound changes. (Doppler's principle for sound.) 

23. A train with a velocity of 47 feet per second is passing a whistling 
engine at rest. The velocity of sound is about 1131 feet per second. 
Find the ratio of the number of sound vibrations which strike the ear of 
an observer on the moving train before it reaches the engine to the cor- 
responding number of vibrations after it has passed. (Read Examples 
21 and 22 to assist you in solving this example.) 

24. Light is produced by the vibrations of the so-called "ether." The 
number of vibrations which strike the eye per second will be modified by 
motion in the line of sight either of the observer or of the source of light. 
The number of vibrations which strike the eye per second may be meas- 
ured (l)y means of a spectroscope). Explain how these facts make it 
possible to measure the velocity with which a star is approaching or 
receding from the earth. (Doppler's principle for light.) 

25. The centigrade thermometer scale is obtained by marking the 
freezing point of water 0Â°, the boiling point of water 100Â°, and dividing 
the interval into 100 equal parts. On the Fahrenheit scale the freezing- 
point and the boiling point are marked 32Â° and 212Â° respectively. Ob- 
tain a formula for reducing temperatures expressed in Fahrenheit degrees 
to centigrade degrees, and make a graph of this formula. 

56. Arithmetic progressions. If we compute the values 
of a linear function 7nx + b, not for all values of x, but only 
for a; = and for positive integral values of x, we find a set 
of numbers 

(1) b, m ->f b, 2 w + b, 3 m + b, 4 m + b, etc. 

each of which differs from the preceding one by the same 
amount. These numbers form an ordered set or a sequence, 
since we are thinking of them as being arranged in a detinite 
order. 

A finite set of numbers is called an ordered set or a sequence^ 
if the numbers of the set are thought of as being arranged in a 
definite order. 



Art. jG] ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 81 

If we wish to discuss an ordered set of niiinbers, it does not suffice to 
know the value of every number of the set. ^Ve must also know which 
is to be regarded as first, which is the second, etc. 

The numbers of an ordered set are said to form an arithmetic 
progression, if the difference hetiveen any number of the set, 
after the first, and the one which precedes it is the same for all 
numbers of the set. 

The numbers of the set are called the terms of the pro- 
gression, and the difference between any term and the pre- 
ceding one is called the common difference. 

The numbers (1) form an arithmetic progression whose 
first term b is any number ; and whose constant difference 
m is any other number. Consequently, any arithmetic pro- 
gression may be represented by the formula (1). We find 
the following result: 

Tlie values which a linear function mx + b assumes, when x 
assumes in order the values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., form an arithmetic 
progression; and converseli/, with any arithmetic p7'Of/ressioji 
there may be associated a linear function mx + b whose values 
coincide ivith the terms of the progression when x is equated in 
order to 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. 

The notation used in (1) is not the one Avhich is usually 
employed in the theory of arithmetic progressions. Let 
us call the first term a instead of b, the common difference 
d instead of m, and let i denote the number of any term, so 
that i replaces x. We then have the customary expressions 

(2) a, a + d, a -f- 2 (?, a -f 3 rZ, â€¢â€¢â€¢ 

for the terms of an arithmetic progression. The ith term 
will be 

(3) a+(i- l)d. 

If there are n terms altogether, and if we denote the last 
(wth) term by I, we shall have 

(4) l=a + {n- l)f?. 



82 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Art. 56 

The principal problem in the theory of arithmetic pro- 
gressions is that of finding a formula for S, the sum of all 
of its n terms. Of course we have 

(5) >S=a+ (a + d) + (a + -2d) + ... +1. 

But, in order to compute the value of jS by this formula, we 
should have to compute each of the terms separately and 
that would be very laborious when the number of terms is 
large. In order to find a more convenient formula for S, 
let us first rewrite S by beginning with the last term, that 
is, by inverting the order of the terms of the progression. 
We shall then have also 

(6) S=l+(l-d-) + (l-2d)+ ... +a. 

If we add the corresponding members of (5) and (6) we 
2S={a + l) + {a + l) + {a + l)+ ... + (a + 0, 

and the right member will contain the binomial a+^ as 
many times as there are terms in the progression, namely n 
times. Consequently 

and 

(7) S=n'^- 

This formula is very easy to remember, if we agree to call 
|-(a. -f Z), which is half of the sum of the first and last terms, 
the average term of the progression. For, we may then ex- 
press the content of (7) as follows : 

The sum of an arithmetic progression of n terms is equal 
to n times its average term. 

If we substitute (4) in (7), Ave find 

(8) S = '^^[2a+in-l)dl 

for the value of S in terms of the first term, the common 
difference, and the number of terms. 



Art. 56] ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 83 

If three of the five quantities a, d^ n, I, S are given, the 
other two may be found from (4) and (7), or from (4) and

a positive integer, while a, d^ I, and S may be positive or 
negative, integral or fractional, rational or irrational, real 
or complex.

57. Insertion of arithmetic means. To insert n arith- 
metic means between two given numbers, a and J, means to 
find n numbers, a^, a,^, a^^ â€¢-â€¢, aâ€ž, such that the w + 2 numbers 

(1) a, Â«i, ^2, â€¢â€¢â€¢, Â«â€ž, h 

shall form an arithmetic progression. There are n + 2 
terms in this progression, a is the first term and b the last. 
Hence we have from (4) of Art. 56, 

h = a + (7i + 2 â€” l}d = a + (n + l)c?, 

where d denotes the common difference. Consequently we 
find 7 

d=^-'' 



n+ 1 
and therefore 

/-ON , b â€” a , ,-.b â€” a , b â€” a

are the n arithmetic means required. 
In particular, if n = 1, we find 

a.^^ = a-\ â€” =a-\-l-bâ€” la=la+^b = |-(a + i). 

Therefore, to insert a sinr/le arithmetic mean between a and 6, 
ive need merely compute half the sum of a and b. This fact 
accounts for the name arithmetic mean which is usually 
given to half the sum of two numbers.

58. Harmonic progressions. A sequence of numbers a^, a^, 

rtg, etc. is said to form a harmonic progression, if the recip- 
rocals of these numbers form an arithmetic progression. 



Art. 59] HARMONIC PROGRESSIONS 85 

Consequently the general ex[)ression for the terms of a 
harmonic progression of n terms is given by

in (1) we put a = d=\ ; this gives the harmonic progression

If we wish to insert n harmonic means between two given 
numbers, a and 6, we may first insert ii arithmetic means be- 
tween 1/a and 1/h. The reciprocals of these arithmetic 
means will be the harmonic means between a and h.

4. Prove that if all of the terms of an arithmetic or harmonic 
progression are multiplied by the same number, the result is again a

59. Geometric progressions. The ancients were familiar 
with the essential properties of arithmetic and harmonic 
progressions. They also considered progressions of the form 

(1) a, ar, ar^ ar^^ ar^^ â€¢â€¢â€¢, 

in which, the exponents of r, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., are in 
arithmetic progression, and spoke of such sequences as 
geometric progressions. If we divide any term of the 
sequence (1), excepting the first, by the term which im- 
mediately precedes it, we always obtain the same quotient, 
namely r. We may therefore define a geometric progres- 
sion as follows: 



86 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Art. 60 

Let us divide each term of a sequence (^excepting the first) 
by the term which immediately precedes it. If all of the quo- 
tients obtained in this ivay have the same value r, the sequence is 
called a geometric progression, and r is called the common ratio 

of the proyression. 

Let a be the first term of the geometric progression and 
let r be the common ratio. Then the various terms of the 
progression will be represented by the expressions (1). 
The first term is a, the second is ar, the third is ar^, and so 
on. The ^th term is ar^~^. If we use the notation a. (not 
to be confused with the symbol a^ for the ith power of a), to 
stand for the ^th term of the progression, we have 

ftj = a, ^2 = ar, a^ = ar\ â€¢â€¢â€¢, 

and in general, for any value of the integer i, 

(2) ai = ar'-\ 

If the progression contains w terms altogether, the last or 
nth term will be 

(3) Â«â€ž = ar"-\ 

Sometimes the last term is denoted by I, so that we have 
also 

(4) I = ar'^-\ 

60. Sum of a geometric progression of n terms. Let us 

denote by S^ the sum of a geometric progression of n terms, 
so that 

(1) Sn= a + ar+ ar^ + ar^ + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + ar"*'^. 

If we multiply both members of (1) by r, we find 

(2) rSn = ar -{â–  ar'^ â– \- ar- -\- â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + ar"" ^ + ar"^. 

If we subtract the members of (2) from the corresponding 
members of (1), we find 

(3) ^; - r/S; = a - ar''. 



Art. 61] GEOMETRIC PROGRESSIONS 87 

since all of the other terms in the right members of (1) and 

(2) are eliniinated by this subtraction. We may write (3) 

as follows : 

(l-r)>S'â€ž = a(l-r"), 

so that we obtain finally 

(4) ^, = <1^^ 

1 â€” r 

provided that r is not equal to unity. 

Formula (4) enables us to compute the sum S^ of n terms of 
a geometric progression ivhose first term is a and whose com- 
mon ratio r is different from unity. 

If r = 1, the final step in the process used for deducing (4) is not per- 
mitted, since we must never divide by zero, and since 1 â€” r would be 
equal to zero in that case. It is very easy, however, to find the formula 
for Sâ€ž in the case when r = 1. We then liave 

(5) S^ = a + a + â– â€¢â€¢ + a â€” na. 

The following alternative expressions for 8^ follow im- 
mediately from (4) 

(6) 8^ = ^ zr-^ = 1- = ^, 

râ€” 1 râ€” 1 râ€” 1 

where I = ar""^ is the last or nth term of the progression. 
We may also write 

^rrx a a â€” ar^ a ar^ 

(J) *^n = -^ 



- r 1 â€” r 1 â€” r 

61. Geometric means. If three numbers a, 5, c form a geo- 
metric progression, b is said to be a geometric mean of a 
and c. Since we shall then have 

b^c 
a b 

we find b^ = ac, 

and therefore 

(1) b = Â± -JTc. 



88 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Art. 61 

Thus, two positive numbers a mid c have two geometric means 
ivhich are equal to + Vac and â€” 'Vac respectively. Usually 
the positive square root of ac is called the geometric mean of a 
and c. 

To insert n geometric means between a and c we must 
find n numbers a^, a^, â– â– â–  Â«â€ž, such that the n + 2 numbers 

shall form a geometric progression. 

Let r denote the common ratio of such a progression. 
Then a will be the first term, and c will be the (w + 2)th 
term. Therefore we must have (Art. 59, equation (3) 
where n is to be replaced by n -\- 2), 

c = ar""^^,

90 LINEAR FUNCTIONS AND PROGRESSIONS [Art. 62 

If we allow w, the number of terms, to increase indefinitely, 
the number 2"~i will grow large very rapidly, and the recip- 
rocal of this number, l/2"~^ will become very small for 
large values of n. It can be shown that l/2'*~i can be made 
as small as may be desired by merely choosing the integer n 
large enough. We express this by saying that the fractioji 
l/2"~^ approaches zero for its limit, when n grows beyond all 
hound, or in symbols 

lim _L = 0. 

^^00 2"-i 

Consequentl}^ >S'â€ž, as given by (2), will approach 2 as its 
limit when n grows beyond all bound, or in symbols, 

lim ^â€ž = 2. 

We may explain this situation by the following geometric 
representation. In Fig. 34, let the line segment OA be two 
units long, and let 

OPi = l, 0^2=1 + 1, OP^ = l + l+\, 0^4 = 1 + 1-^1 + ^, etc. 

It is clear that each of these line-segments is obtained from 
the preceding one by adding to it just half of what would be 

required to make it exactly two units lonsf. 
' ""^ Consequently the line-segment obtained by a 

large number of such operations will never 
be exactly equal to two units ; but the difference between 2 
and the length of such a segment may be made as small as 
we please by repeating the operation often enough. In 
other w^ords, the length of the wth line-segment of this 
sequence, 0Pâ€ž, Avill approach the limit 2. 

We may argue in this way whenever the common ratio r 
is a positive or negative proper fraction. For we shall prove 
later (See Art. 275) that the nth. power of any proper 
fraction approaches the limit zero when n grows beyond 
all bound, that is, 

lim r" = 0, whenever i r I < 1. 



Art. 0:5] PERIODIC DECIMALS 91 

Consequently, formula (7) of Art. 60, that is, 



r 

shows us that S^ will approach the limit 

1 â€” r 

when n grows beyond all bound, since the second term of (3) 
Avill have zero for its limit if r is a proper fraction. 

We obtain the following theorem : If the common ratio r 
of a geometric progression is a positive or negative proper frac- 
tion, the sum of the first n terms of the progression will approach 
a finite limit, namely 

(4) S=-^, 

1 â€” r . 

if the numher of terms n is allowed to increase beyond all 
bound. 

The limit S, obtained in this way, is usually called the 
sum of the progression with infinitely many terms. There is 
no harm in using this terminology. But it is necessary to 
remember that this involves an extension of the notion of a 
sum, since the original definition of a sum was applicable 
only to the case of a finite number of terms. Strictly speak- 
ing, iS is not a sum at all, but it is the limit which a certain 
sum approaches when the number of terms is increased 
beyond all bound. 

63. Periodic decimals. A periodic decimal is a geometric 
progression whose common ratio is the reciprocal of a power 
of ten. Thus q q ^ 

In this case a = 3/10 and r = 1/10. Therefore formula (4) 
of Art. 62 gives 3 ^

furnishing a proof of the fact that the decimal fraction 
.333 â€¢ â€¢â€¢ approaches the value 1/3 as its limit as the number 
of places grows beyond all bound. 

The value of any repeating decimal may be found in this 
way, even if the repeating part of the decimal is preceded by 
several figures which are not repeated. 

Thus 1.7414141 â€¢â€¢â€¢ = 1.7 + .041 + â€” + -^^^ + ... 

100 (lOO)-^ 

^ 17 .041 ^17 .041 ^17 41 
1 - ik 10 .99 10 990' 

These examples illustrate the following general theorem: 

Every periodic decimal is equal to a rational number^ whose 
value may he obtained by finding the sum of a geometric pro- 
gression with infinitely many terms. 

Of course every terminating decimal is also equal to a 
rational number, that is, to a quotient of two integers. In 
the case of a terminating decimal, the denominator is a 
power of ten. 

Thus 1.376 is a rational number, since it is equal to 1376 -=- 1000. 

Thus, every terminating and every periodic decimal repre- 
sents a rational number. 

The converse of this theorem is also true. 

That is, if any rational number is expressed as a decimal., 
this decimal must either terminate., or else it must be periodic. 

In this statement, given without proof, it is understood, of course, 
that there may be any number of digits in a period, and that the periodic 
portion of the decimal may be preceded by a finite number of digits 
which do not repeat. Thus we shall speak of 327.56431431431 .-.as a 
periodic decimal although the first period (consisting of three digits) is 
preceded by five digits wliich are not repeated. 

Therefore, if an irrational number is expressed as a decimal., 
this decimal cannot be periodic, nor can it terminate. 

This theorem offers an excellent illustration of the great power of a 
mathematical argument, and its immense superiority over mere numerical 



Art. 63] PERIODIC DECIMALS 93 

calculation. Thus we have seen in Art. 14 that a/'J is an irrational 
number, and we have learned in elementary algebra how to express v'2 
as a decimal. Xo amount of calculation, even if carried to thousands of 
places, could ever show us whether this decimal expression for V2 is 
periodic or not. But our theorems enable us to assert positively, with- 
out any calculation whatever, that the decimal expression for y/2 is not 
periodic.

CHAPTER III 

QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS AND EQUATIONS 

64. Standard form of a quadratic function. Any expression 
of the form 

(1) ax^ 4- Sa; + c, 

where Â«, ft, e are constants, and where re is a variable, is 
called a quadratic function of x. Since such a function 
would reduce to a linear function if a were equal to zero, we 
shall henceforth assume a^O. Aside from this restriction 
upon a, the coefficients a, 6, c may be any real or complex 
numbers, but we shall usually confine our discussion to the 
case where a, ft, c are real. In particular, ft or <?, or both ft 
and c, may be equal to zero. 

It happens frequently that a quadratic function appears in 
a more complicated form than (1), owing to the fact that 
various terms, which might be united into a single one, are 
'written separately. When such an expression is rewritten 
in the form (1), we say that it has been reduced to its 
standard form. 

EXERCISE XIX 

Reduce the following quadratic functious of x to the standard form, 
and indicate the values of a, h, and c in each case. 

1. 5 X + 4 - .3 x2. 2. 2 a:^ + a; - .5 X- - 4 X + 7. 

3. mx + ix2 + 3 r/x - 4 + d. 4. (mx + ky^ + x- - r^. 

65. Graph of a quadratic function. The method used in 
Art. 52 for making the graph of a linear function may also 
be applied to a quadratic function. But the graph will not 
be a straight line. The curved graph obtained by plotting 
a quadratic function is called a parabola. The following 
examples will serve to make the student familiar with the 
form of this curve.

EXERCISE XX 

1. Construct the graph of the func- 
tion X-. 

Solution. We put y = x-, and assign 
to X arbitrary values, such as â€” 4, â€” 3, 
- 2, - 1, 0, + 1, + 2, +3, +4, etc. 

We compute the corre- 
sponding values of y and 

obtain in this way the pairs 

of numbers indicated in the 

table. Each of these pairs 

of numbers we regard as 

the coordinates of a point, 

indicated in Fig. 35 by a 

little cross. Finally we 

join these points by a 

smooth curve. Observe 

that the curve has a lowest 
point or minimum at (0, 0), and that the 
curve i^ symmetric with respect to the 

//-axis. The point O is called the vertex of the parabola, and the axis of 
symmetry (the ^/-axis in this case) is called its axis. 

2. Draw the graphs oi y = 2 x"^, y â€” o ofi, y â€” \ ^^i y = \ ^' ^"^^ com- 
pare with the graph oiy â€” x^ as obtained in Ex. 1. For the purposes of 
this comparison it is desirable to draw these five curves on the same 
sheet, referred to the same coordinate axes. 

3. Draw the graphs of y = â€” x-, y â€” â€” 2 x% y = â€” 'i x'-, y = â€” I x-, 
y = ~ I x^, and compare with the graphs of Ex. 2. 

4. Show that the graph of y = ax- may be obtained from that of 
y = x'^ by multiplying all of the ordiuates of the latter by a. Discuss 
the effect of this multiplication upon the form and position of the graph 
according as a is positive or negative, greater than unity, or less than 
unity. 

5. Draw the graphs of 

y=(x- 1)2, y = (X - 2)^ y=(x-h 1)-, // = (x + 2)2, 
and compare with the graph of // = x-. 

Hint. Compute the values of (x - 1)'- etc., without expanding these 
expressions. 

6. Show that the graph of y -(x â€” h)'- may be obtained from that 
of y = J- by moving the latter through a distance of h units, toward the 
right or left according as h is positive or negative. 



96 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 66 

7. Draw the graphs of 

?/ â€” 1 = x% y â€” 2 = x"^, // + 1 = x^, 1/ + 2 = x^ 
and compare with the graph of ?/ = x-. 

8. Show that the graph of // â€” k = .r^ may be obtained from that of 
1/ = X- by moving the latter through a distance of k units, upward or 
downward according as k is positive or negative. 

9. Show that the graph of y â€” k = a(x â€” hy may be obtained from 
that oi y = x^ by combining the three operations indicated in Exs. 4, 6, 
and 8. What are the coordinates of its vertex, and what is the equation 
of its axis, these terms being explained in ICx. 1? 

10. Draw the graph of ?/ = 3 x^ + 6 x + .5. 

Hint. Write y â€” b = 3(x'^ + 2x), and complete the square in the 
parenthesis on the right, giving y â€” 2 = 3(x + 1)"^. Then apply Ex. 9. 

11. Draw the graph of y = 2 x^ + i x ^ 1. Find the coordinates of 
its vertex and the equation of its axis. 

12. Draw the graph of y = â€” 2 x"^ + Sx j- 2. Find the coordinates 
of its vertex, and the equation of its axis. 

Hint. Use the method of Ex. 10 and then apply Ex. 9. 

66. The maximum or minimum of a quadratic function. 
The parabola, obtained in Ex. 1, Exercise XX, as the graph 
oi y = 2;2, has a minimum for x = 0, that is, the ordinate 
which corresponds to a: = is smaller than that of any 
neighboring point of the curve. Similarly the graph of 
y = â€” x\ obtained in Ex. 3, has a maximum for a; = 0. 

By Ex. 9 of Exercise XX, the graph of 

(1) y -k = a(x - hy 

may be obtained from that oi y = x^ by the following opera- 
tions. Firsts all of the ordinates of the graph oi y = x^ are 
multiplied by a; secondly, the resulting curve is moved (with- 
out rotation) through a distance of h units parallel to the 
2;-axis (to the right or left according as h is positive or neg- 
ative) and through a distance of k units parallel to the y-axis 
(up or down according as k is positive or negative). We 
conclude that the graph of (1) will have either a minimum 
or a maximum at the point (A, k) ; the former if a is positive, 
the latter if a is negative. In either case the point (A, k^ is 



Art. 66] THE MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM 97 

called the vertex of the parabola. The axis of the parabola 
passes through the vertex and is parallel to the y-axis. Its 
equation will he x = h. 

In order to prove that such a maximum or minimum exists 
upon the graph of awy quadratic function 
(2) 1/ = ax^ + bx -\- e, a ^t 0, 

it will suffice to generalize the process indicated in Ex. 10 
of Exercise XX. This process really consists in rewriting 
(2) in the form (1), that is, in "completing the square" 
in the trinomial which occurs in (2). Thus we rewrite (2) 
as follows : 



y â€” a\ x^ -\ â€” X + -]= a 



a 4 aV 4 a^ a 



or 

(3) y = a\[x + -y-^^ 

which may finally be written in the form 
J \2 52 _ 4 ^^ 



(4) y = <- + 2^J 



4a 



Let us assume, in the first place, that a is positive. Since 
the square of a real number is always positive or zero, (4) 
shows that (if a is positive), 

t/ = 1- something positive, 

for all real values of x except for x = â€” h/2 a, in which case 
we have exactly 

(â€¢^) 2: = - --, 1/ = + = 

2a 4a 4a 

Since 1/ is greater than the value indicated in (5) for all 
other values of x, we have the following result : 

The function y = ax'^ + hx + e possesses a minimum whenever 
a is positive. The value of x for u'hich the function assumes 
its minimum value is â€” h/'2 a, and the minimum value of the 
function is â€” (l)^ â€” 4 ac) jA. a. 



98 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 66 

Similarly it follows that the funotion possesses a maximum 
whenever a is negative. The values of x and i/ which corre- 
spond to the maximum are again given by (5). The point 

.r,^ h 5^ â€” 4 ac 
(6) - = -2^' 2' = 4^' 

is called the vertex of the parabola in either case, and the 
line for all of whose points 

(^) â€”ta 

is the axis of the parabola. 

In plotting an equation of the form (2), it is advisable to 
determine first the vertex, by means of (6), and second the 
axis, which passes through the vertex and is parallel to the 
y-axis. The parabola will be turned up or down according 
as a is positive or negative. Since the parabola is sym- 
metric with respect to its axis, and since we are now 
acquainted with the general appearance of the curve, we 
may make a fairly accurate sketch of the graph if we com- 
pute one further point upon it. This additional point 
enables us to give the parabola the proper spread. 

EXERCISE XXI 

Draw the graphs of the following quadratic functions. Determine 
the vertex and axis of each graph, and state whether the vertex cor- 
responds to a maximuni or minimum. 

1. 11 = X- + a: + 1. 3. y = - x^ + X + 1. 

2. 1/ - 3 x- - 5 X + 2. 4. // = - 2 x^ - 5 x + 7. 

5. Tlie number 82 is to be divided into two parts such that the 
product of these parts shall be as great as possible (a maximum). Find 
the parts. 

6. Generalize this problem (Ex. .5) to the case where the given num- 
ber is any number n instead of 82. 

7. Prove that the square has a greater area than any rectangle with 
the same perimeter. 

8. Two straight railroad tracks are perpendicular to each other at a 
point 0. An engine starts at a station A, ten miles from O on the first 
track, and moves toward O with a speed of 30 miles per hour. A second 



Akt. 67] GRAPHIC DETERMINATION OF THE ZEROS 99 

engine starts at the same instant from B, fifteen miles away from on 
the second track, and moves toward O with a speed of 25 miles per hour. 
When will the distance between the two engines be a minimum ? 

9. Generalize problem 8 for the case where the distances are OA = a, 
OB = h, and where the velocities of the two engines are v and v' 
respectively. 

67. Graphic determination of the zeros of a quadratic func- 
tion. It appears clearly from our examples, and also from 
the discussion of Art. 66, that the graph of a 
quadratic function 

(1) 1/ = ax^ -\- bx + c 



+y 



may, or may not, cross the a:-axis. If it does 

cross the a;-axis, in two points A and B (See ^ig 3G 

Fig. 36), the abscissas of these points are said 

to be zeros of the function ; because, if either of these values 

be substituted for x, the corresponding value of the function 

(1) will be equal to zero. More specifically, the abscissas of 

A and B are called the real zeros of the function, because they 

are real numbers. Clearly, then, the real zeros of (1) may 

be obtained approximately by an inspection of the graph. 

Obviously the quadratic function miai? -\-hx-\- c), obtained 
from (1) by multiplication with any non-vanishing constant 
wi, has the same zeros as (1). Now the zeros of the quad- 
ratic function ax"^ -^-hx -\- c are also called the roots or solu- 
tions of the quadratic equation ay?' + 5a; + c = 0, which is 
obtained by equating the function to zero. Thus, while 
\kiQ functioyi m{ax?' -\- hx -\- c) is by no means the same func- 
tion as ay? + hx + c, both functions have the same zeros, so 
that the tivo quadratic equations 

m(a^ -f- hx -|- c) = and ay? -\- hx -\- c =â–  ^ 

are to he regarded as equivalent, inasmuch as the same values 
of X will satisfy them both. 

For instance, 4(x'^ â€” 1) is a different function from x^ â€” 1. Except 
for .r = Â± I their values are different, the values of the former function 
being just four times as great as the corresponding values of the hitter. 



100 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 68 

But the two functions are equal to zero for the same values of x, namely 
for x= Â±\. Therefore the equations 4(x2â€” 1) = and x^â€” 1=0 are 
equivalent. 

Since division by a non-vanishing number m is equivalent 
to multiplication by the reciprocal 1/m, our remark justifies 
the following statement : In solving a quadratic equation^ we 
tnay inultiply or divide both members of the equation by the same 
non-vanishing constant. 

EXERCISE XXII 

Find the real zeros of each of the following quadratic functions by in- 
spection from their graphs, or else show that the function has no real 
zeros : 

1. x2 - 3 X + 2. 4. Zx"^ -X- 4. 

2. x2 + 6 X + 5. 5. x^ + X + 1. 

3. 2 x2 - 4 X + 2. 6. 2 x2 - 4. 

68. Calculation of the real zeros of a quadratic function. 

The graphic method of determining the real zeros of a 
quadratic function usually gives us only approximate values 
of these zeros. To determine their exact values we return 
to formulas (2) and (3) of Art. QQ., according to which 



(1) y = ax^ -\- bx + c = a 



b\2 b^-4ac 



If a, b, e are real numbers, 4 a^ is positive, but b^ â€” 4: ac may be 
positive, zero, or negative. Let us consider only those cases 
at present where 6^ â€” 4a(? is positive or zero, but not negative. 
Then, the square root of P â€” 4 ac is a, real number, and we 
may regard the bracket in (1) as the difference between the 
squares of two real numbers, namely. 



y=a 



h Y ^V52_4acV 



But a difference between two squares may be factored in 
familiar fashion, so that we obtain 



\ 'la la )\ la 2a J 



Art. 68] CALCULATION OF THE REAL ZEROS 101 

This expression shows that y will become equal to zero if 
and only if one of the factors of the right member is equal to 
zero, that is, if and only if x is equal to 



either r or r . 

la z a 

Tlierefore, the quadratic function ax^ -[-bx + c has tivo real 
zeros, namely 

^o N â€” ^ Â± V62 â€” 4 ac 
^â€¢'^ " = 2-a â€¢ 

provided that b^ â€” -i ac > 0. These two zeros coincide (^become 
identical) if 6^ â€” 4 a<? = 0. 

It is easy to see that there are no real zeros if b^ â€” 4: ac is 
negative. For if b'^ â€” 4 ac < 0, we have 

_b^ â€”4: ac f. 
4 a^ 

so that the second term in the bracket of (1) is positive. 
The first term is never negative for real values of x. There- 
fore the bracket will be positive for all real values of x. 
Consequently y will be positive for all real values of x if 
b^â€” 4 ac < and a > 0. Similarly y will be negative for all 
real values of a; if 5^ â€” 4 ac < and a < 0. In neither case 
will there exist a real value of x which makes y equal to zero. 
The values of x which satisfy the equation 

(4) ar^ + bx + c=0 

are called its roots. From this definition it follows that 
the zeros of the quadratic function ax^ + bx -\- c are also the 
roots of the quadratic equation (4), this equation being 
obtained from the function by equating the function to zero. 

Thus the roots of (4) are given by (3). Let us denote 
these roots by x^ and x^, that is, let us put 

.r. _ - ^ + V&2 _ 4 ag _ - ^ _ V^2 _ 4 a g 

^'^^ ""1" 2a ' "^2- l~a 



102 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 69 

Then we may write (2) as follows: 

(6) y = ax^ -\- hx -\- c = a(x â€” x-^(x â€” x^. 
Consequently we find the followmg relation : 

If the quadratic function ax^ â– \- hx + c has the factors x â€” x^ 
and X â€” x^, then the quadratic equation ax^ + hx + c = Q has 
the roots x^ and x^ ; and conversely. 

Clearly, then, the problem of factoring the quadratic 
function ax^ + hx + c and the problem of solving the quad- 
ratic equation a:x? -\-hx â– \- c =â–  ^ are so closely allied as to be 
regarded as equivalent. The solution of either problem 
implies that of the other. 

If we add the two roots x^ and x^ as given by (5), we find 

(7) a^i + 0^2 = - -, 
and if we multiply these roots we find 

(8) ^^^^ = _Ljj2_^52_4^,)j=^. 

That is : the sum of the two roots of a quadratic equation 

ax^ + hx -{- c = ^ 

is equal to â€” b/a, and the product of the roots is equal to c/a. 

Thus, the product and sum of the roots of a quadratic 
equation may be obtained by mere inspection although the 
determination of the roots themselves requires the extraction 
of a square root. 

69. Another method of deriving the formulas for the roots 
of a quadratic equation. The formulas (3) or (5), of Art. 
68 may also be obtained as follows. If the equation 

(1) ax^ + bx+ c= 

is given, we divide both members by a and transpose the 
constant term. This gives 

2 , ^ <? 

x^ + -z= 

a a 



Art. 69] COMPLETING THE SQUARE 103 

We now add 6^4 o? to both members so as to " complete the 
square. We find 

(2) TT â– { â€” X -\ = 1 = . 

Finally we extract the square root of both members and find 

a: + -â€” = Â± -â€” V5^ â€” 4 ac, 
2 a z a 

whence finally 

^ON â€” h Â± Vh^ â€” 4 ac 

(3) x = â€” 



z a 



as before. 



This method is convenient to apply to particular equations in practice. 
Theoretically it is inferior to the proof of equation (3) which is given 
in Art. 68. The proof given just now only assures us that if equation 
(1) has a root, it will be given by one of the values (3). To prove 
that (1) actually has a root we should take the further step of substitut- 
ing each of the values (3) for x in the left member of (1), and verifying 
that the result is actually equal to zero. This verification, which 
is carried out in Art. 70 for another purpose, is unnecessary if we prove 
equation (3) by the method of Art. 68.

X = 4 as its zeros. 

Sdutian. The function (x -3)(x - 4) is a quadratic function and 
has the given zeros. If a is any non-vanishing constant, a (x â€” 3)(x â€” 4) 
will stiU have the given zeros : and this product wiQ still be a quadratic 
function because a is a constant, that Ls. does not involve x. If a were 
not a constant, the product a(x - 3)(x â€” 4) would, in most cases, still 
have the required zeros, but it would fail to be a quadratic function of x. 
Thus a (x â€” 3) (x - 4) is the required function.

shoald now be discns-sed nnless the student's high school course covered imagi- 
nary numbers suflSciently well. If desired Art. 70 and all subsequent discussions 
involving complex numbers may be omitted. 



Art. 70] COMPLEX ROOTS 105 

In harmony with this fact, the values of arj and x^i as given 
by formulas (5) of Art. 68, are not real. They are com- 
plex numbers, since they involve the square root of the neg- 
ative number 6^ â€” 4 ac. But, although these numbers are 
complex, they satisfy equation (1). In fact, the argument 
by which they were obtained holds just as well in the case 
b^ â€” 4 ac <. as in the case P â€” 4ae ^ 0, since the laws ac- 
cording to which complex numbers combine are just the 
same as those for real numbers, excepting only the mono- 
tonic laws, and the latter were not used in deriving these 
formulae. (See Art. 35.) 

We shall give a direct verification of the fact that the 
expressions (5) of Art. 68 are roots of equation (1) whether 
6^ â€” 4 ae is positive, zero, or negative. In fact, this verifica- 
tion is valuable as a check even for the case b^ â€” 4 ac ^ 0. 

Let us, then, compute the value of the quadratic function 
ax^ + bx+ c, if we put in it 

_ - ^ -I- V^2 _ 4 ag 
X â€” x^ â€”

We find

so that x^ is actually a solution of (1). The verification for 
x^ is similar. 

Tlius, while a quadratic equation may have no real roots, it 
always has roots, either real or complex. Moreover, we may 
say that it always has tivo roots, at least if J^ â€” 4 ac is not 
equal to zero. If J^ _ 4 ac is equal to zero, we see from (1) 
Art. 68, that , . 2

and may therefore be regarded as a perfect square. Thus, 

the factors of ax^ -\- hx + c, which are in general distinct, are 

equal to each other if 

^>2 _ 4 ac = 0, 



that is, ax^ -\- hx -\- c = 



Va( x-\- ~â€”

H^^i:)] 



Hence, the quadratic function has two linear factors in 
this case also, even if they are both the same. Since the fac- 
tors of the function are so closely related to the roots of the 
equation, we shall say that the corresponding equation has 
two roots, but that these roots are equal to each other or 
coincide. 

With this terminology now perfected, we have actually 
proved the following important theorem : 

The quadratic equation with real coefficients 
(1) ax? + hx + c=0 

always has two roots, namely 



,-,. -J + V62-4a6' _5_V^>2_4a6' 

(2) x^=- , x^=

These roots are real and distinct if b^ â€” 4: ac > 0, they are real 
and coincident if h^ â€” 4: ac = 0, and they are conjugate complex 
numbers if b^ â€” 4 ac <i 0. (See Art. 34 for definition of con- 
jugate complex numbers.) 

The quantity b^ â€” 4 ac, whose value enables us to discrim- 
inate between these cases, is called the discriminant of the 
quadratic. 

We may even say that a quadratic equation (1), whose coefficients a, 
h, c are any complex numbers, always has twb roots which are also com- 
plex quantities given by equations (2). The algebraic verification given 
in this article applies to all such cases without change. 

71. Various methods of solving a quadratic equation or of fac- 
toring a quadratic function. We now know how to solve any 
(quadratic equation. We may do this by making use of 



Art. 71] VARIOUS METHODS OF SOLUTION 107 

formulas (3) of Art. 69 ; or else we may carry out the pro- 
cess which was used in deriving these formulas (completing 
the square and extracting a square root); or we may be able 
to factor the corresponding quadratic function by inspection. 
Of course, all of these methods are, at bottom, identical. 
The student is advised, however, to make use of the second 
method in preference to the first, at least until he has mas-

In examples 23 to 29, find what value or values k must have in order 
that the quadratic equation may have its two roots equal. 

23. x2 + 3 ^â€¢x + ^- + 7 = 0. 

Solution. In order that the roots may be equal, the discriminant must 
vanish, that is, we must have 

62 - 4 ac = 9 F - 4(A: + 7) = 0. 

Solving this quadratic equation for k gives k = 2 or â€” ^^-. 

Verification. For k = 2, the equation becomes 
x2 + 6x+9=0, 
which actually has two equal roots, each being â€” 3. 

For k â€” â€” 4/9, the equation becomes 

x2 - -V ^ + Â¥ = 0, 

which has two equal roots, each being â€” 7/3.

Verify that 1 + i is a root of the equation x2 â€” 2x+ 2 = 0, by

Solution. The complex quantity x = 1 + i is represented in Fig. 37 by 
the vector OP whose length is equal to V2 and which makes an angle of 
45Â° witli the x-axis. The square of this vector may 
be constructed by the method of Art. 31. It is rep- 
resented by the vector OQ of length 2 and am- 
plitude 90Â°. Clearly OP' represents 2x, and OP" 
represents â€” 2x. The parallelogram construction 
(see Art. 26) gives OP'" as representative of 
x2 â€” 2 X, and OR represents the number + 2. 
But the sum of the vectors OP"' and OR is 
clearly equal to zero.

means of the graphic representation.

x\ and Xg between the three equations obtained in this way. 

72. Special forms of quadratic equations. The special cases 
which arise if one or more of the coefficients a, b, c of the 
quadratic equation 

ax^ + bx + c = 

are equal to zero, should be mentioned explicitly. 

1 . /f a =it 0, 6 ^fc 0, c = 0, the resulting quadratic, namely 

ax^ + 6a; = 0, 

has one of its roots equal to zero. 

2. If a=^0, b = 0, c^O, ice obtain a so-called pure quadratic 

ax^ + c= 0, 

whose two roots are numerically equal but opposite in sign. 

The case a = cannot properly present itself here, since 
the equation would then cease to be a quadratic. We shall, 
however, later, consider a case closely connected with this, 
namely the case where a is regarded as a variable whose value 
approaches zero as a limit. 

3. // a ^ 0, 6 = c = 0, the quadratic reduces to 

ax^ = 0, 

both of whose roots are equal to zero. 

It is easy to show that the converse of each of the three 
statements 1, 2, 3, is also true. The proof is left for the 
student.

equations.* While it is not always easy to recognize equa- 
tions of this kind, the following examples will furnish some 
illustrations.

Hint. Observe that x = 2 is one root of this equation so that x â€” 2 is

74. Rational and irrational roots of a quadratic equation. 

We have discussed carefully the character of the roots of a 
quadratic ec^uation from the point of view as to whether 
they are real or complex. But there is another, more 
subtle, distinction which is also important, namely the dis- 
tinction between rational and irrational roots. 
Let 

(1) ax'^-\-bx + c = 

be a quadratic equation whose coefficients a, b, c are ra- 
tional numbers. (Cf. Art. 8.) Each of these coefficients 
may then be expressed as a quotient of two integers, that 
is, as a fraction. If these three fractions be reduced to a 
common denominator p^ we may write 

I 7 m n 

a = -, A = â€” , c = -, 

F P P 

so that the equation (1) becomes 

-x^ â– ] â€” x+ -= 0. 
p p p 

But this equation has the same roots as the equation 

(2) Ix^ + mx 4- w = 0, 

whose coefficients are integers. (See Art. 67.) 
The roots of (2) are 



^o\ â€” m + Vw^ â€” 4ln â€” 711 â€” Vwz^ â€” 4 In 

(6) 2*1 = â–  , 3*0 = , 

11 21 

and they are clearly rational numbers if m^ â€” 4 /w is a perfect 
square, so that Vw^ â€” 4 ^Ai is an integer. If ni^ â€” 4 ?n is pos- 



112 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 75 

itive and not a perfect square, its square root will be irra- 
tional. We may prove that this statement is true by 
the method which was used in Art. 15 to show that V2 is 
irrational. From the first equation of (8) we find, by clear- 
ing of fractions and transposing, 



2 Ix-^ -\- m = Vw'^ â€” 4 In. 

If x^ were rational, the left member would be a rational 
number, while the right member is irrational. This is a 
contradiction, so that a-j must be irrational. Similarly it 
follows that X2 must be irrational. We have proved the 
following theorem : 

The solution of a quadratic equation with rational coefficients 
may he reduced to the solution of an equivalent equation., 

Ix^ + mx -\- n = 

with integral coefficients. Tlie roots of this equation ivill he 
rational., if and only if the discriminant mn? â€” \ In is a perfect 
square. 

EXERCISE XXVII 

Apply this criterion to Examples 1 to 8 of Exercise XXIV. 

75. Quadratic surds. The roots of the quadratic equation 
(2) of Art. 74 are irrational if 

m^ â€” 4 Zw = c^ 

is positive and not a perfect square. This depends essen- 
tially upon the fact that the expressions (3) of Art. 74 for 
these roots contain the square root of d. An irrational num- 
ber, such as V5, the square root of an integer which is posi- 
tive and not a perfect square, is called a quadratic surd. The 
same name is sometimes also applied to irrational numbers of 
the form Vc^ where d., instead of being an integer, is a ra- 
tional fraction which is not a perfect square. We shall use 
the term in this more general sense. 

The following theorem is fundamental in dealing with 
such surds : 



Art. 75] QUADRATIC SURDS 113 

//' a, b, a\ h\ and d are rational numbers^ and if d is posi- 
tive and not a perfect square, so that y/d is irrational, then an 
equatio7i of the form 

(1) a + h^d = a' + h'-^d 
can subsist only if 

(2) a = a' and b = b'. 
In fact, from (1) follows 

(3) a-a' = ib' - b)^d. 

If b' were not equal to b, b' â€” b would be different from zero 

and it would be permissible to divide both members of (3) 

by b' - b, giving 

a â€” a / 7 

_ = V tÂ«. 

b' -b 

But this equation involves a contradiction, since one of its 
members is a rational number, while the other is irrational. 
Therefore b' â€”b cannot be different from zero ; that is, we 
must have b' = b. But this condition, together with (1), 
shows that we must also have a' = a. Consequently the 
theorem is established. 

We know that irrational numbers obey the same funda- 
mental laws of addition and multiplication (Laws I to IX 
of Art. 2) which were originally observed to be true for 
positive integers. Let us then examine the sura, difference, 
product, and quotient of two numbers of the form a + bVd 
and a' + b'Vd, where a, b, a', 6', d are rational numbers and 
where Vo? is irrational. We have immediately 

(a + b^d) + (a' + bWd) = a + a' + (b + //) V^, 
^ ^ (a + bVd) - (a' + bWd) = a-a' + (b- b')Vd, 

if we make use of the commutative and associative laws of 
addition and multiplication, and also of the distributive law 
of multiplication. 

Again we find in similar fashion 

(5) (a + bVd)(a' + bWd) = aa' + bb'd + i^ab' + a'b)Vd, 



114 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 75 

and also, if a! and h' are not both equal to zero, 

^a\ a + bVd a + h^d a' â€” b'^d 
(6) â–  = = = X r

~ a'2 _ 5/2;^ - - a'2 _ 5^2^ + a'^-b'H ' 

where the denominator a'^ â€” b''^d cannot be equal to zero. 
For, if it were, we should have 



d='' 



contrary to our assumption that d is not a perfect square. 

Each of the right members in (4), (5), and (6) may be 
rewritten in the form A + B^d, where A and B are 
rational numbers. We see, therefore, that the sum, differ- 
ence, product, and quotient of two numbers of the form a + hVd, 
a' + b' Vd is again a tiwnber of the same kind, the usual excep- 
tion, which excludes division by zero, being made in the case of 
the quotient. 

This property of the numbers a + b^d is often expressed 
by saying that they form a field. 

The process indicated in (6) is usually called rationalizing 
the denominator, and is of great importance in dealing with 
surds. The auxiliary quantity- a' â€” b'^d, used in this pro- 
cess, is often called the conjugate of a' +b'Vd. 

If an expression involves more than one quadratic surd, it 
may be simplified by treating separately the several surds 
which occur in it by the method here indicated.

Art. 76] SQUARE ROOT OF a + bVd 115 

76.* The square root of an expression of the form a + by/d. 

Let us again consider a niuuber of the form a + hVd where a, b, and d 
are rational, but where d is a positive rational number which is not a 
perfect square. The square root of a + bVd will not, in general, be 
expressible as a sum of two quadratic surds. There are some cases, how- 
ever, in which this may be done, and we propose to answer the question 
as to what cases these are. 

Let us suppose that there exist two positive rational numbers, z and 
y, such that 

(1) Va + hVd = \/xÂ± Vy. 

To avoid ambiguity we shall assume here, as elsewhere in this book, 
that the symbol y/k stands for the positive square root of k whenever k 
itself is a positive number. We shall assume, moreover, that a + bVd is 
a positive number, so that it has a positive square root. This assump- 
tion does not prevent one of the rational numbers, a or b, ivom being 
negative ; but they may not both be negative. One of the two terms in 
the right member of (1) maybe negative, but not both. Since the right 
member as a whole must be positive, equation (1) implies that, if there 
is a minus sign at all in the right member, the notation has been so 
chosen that, of the two positive numbers z and y, the greater has been 
called X. 

If (1) hold.s, we must have 

(2) a + bVd =(y/x Â±\/]/y^ = X + y Â±2Vxy. 

Since a, b, x, and y are rational, while y/d is not, the quantity Vxy cannot 
be rational. For if it were, a + bVd would, according to (2), be rational. 
According to Art. 75 we therefore conclude, from (2), 

(3) X + y = a, Â±2 Vxy = bVd, 
whence 

(4) x + y = a, xy = I b^d. 

We can easily form a quadratic equation of which x and y shall be the 
roots, namely (see Art. 68 and Exercise XXIII, Ex. 19), 

(z-x)(z-y)=0, 
^'^ z' - (x 4- y)z + xy = 0, 

which becomes, on account of (4), 
(.5) z^ - az + \ b-d = 0. 

If this quadratic has irrational roots, equation (1) will be impossible, 
since we assumed x and y, which are the roots of (5), to be rational. 
Now the discriminant of (5) is a- - b'-d and the coefficients of (5) are 

â™¦Article 76 and Exercise XXIX may be omitted without destroying the conti- 

uuity. 



116 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 76 

rational. Therefore (see Art. 74) the roots of (5) are irrational unless 
fl2 â€” Ifid is the square of a rational number. 

Thus, if ifi â€” }P-d is not a perfect square, (1) is impossible. If cfi â€” IM 
is a perfect square both of the roots of (5), namely 



0+ Va2-62rf a-^/a^ - hM 
x = ^ , y = 2 , 

will be rational. Moreover, if a is positive, both x and y will be positive. 
This is evident as far as x is concerned; y will be positive in this case 
because Va- â€” h'^d is less than Va^ = a. If a is negative, y will be nega- 
tive, so that this case (o < 0) is excluded, since we have assumed that 
both X and y shall be positive. 

If we have a > and a- â€” V^d a perfect square, x and y will be positive 
rational numbers which satisfy equations (4). Both Vx and ^y will 
then be real positive numbers, and we may choose the sign + or â€” in 
(8) according as h is positive or negative. After this choice of sign has 
been made, equations (3) will be satisfied, and we shall actually have 
the positive square root of a + h^/d expressed in the form (1), with the 
+ or â€” sign according as h is positive or negative. 

Our complete result may be summarized as follows: 

Let a, b, d, x, and y be positive rational numbers, such that y/d is irrational. 
It is possible to write 



y^ 



(6) Vn + bVd = Vx + \^y, Va - by/d = y/x -\/, 

if and only if a? â€” bM is a perfect square. The values of x and y will then 
be given by the expressions 

a + y/cfi - bM a - Va^ - Â¥d 

(0 ^ = 7i Â» y^ o 



EXERCISE XXIX 

1. Examine the possibility of expressing v 3 + 2V2 in the form 
y/x -\- yfif. 

Solution. In this case a = 3, b = 2, d â€” 2, so that o- â€” b-d = 1, a 

perfect square. Moreover, a, b, and d are positive. Therefore we find 

from (7) 

3 + 1 o '^ - 1 1 

X = â€” -â€” = 2, // = -â€” â€” ^ 1, 



so that V3 + 2 V2 = V2 + Vl := 1 + V2. 

Of course the solution may also be obtained without using the 
formulic (7), by applying to this particular case the process by means of 
which these formulas were derived. The student should do this to help 
him understand the general process. 



Art. 77] APPLICATION OF THE MONOTONIC LAWS 117 



2. Examine the possibility of expressing V 4 + 2\/2 in the form 
Vj; + Vy. 

Solution. In this case a^ â€” b^d = 16 â€” 8 = 8, which is not a perfect 

square. Therefore such an expression is impossible for V 4 + 2V2.

square roots in the form y/x Â± Vy whenever possible.

77.* Application of the monotonic laws of Algebra in nu- 
merical calculations involving quadratic surds. The student has 
learned in his first course in Algebra how to calculate the value of a 
quadratic surd, that is, of a square root, to as many decimal places as 
may be desired. Let x be the exact value of the surd ( V2 for instance), 
and let xâ€ž be the approximate value found for it by carrying out the 
process of extracting the square root to n decimal places. Then xâ€ž will 
be a decimal fraction with n digits to the right of the decimal point, and 
we shall have xâ€ž<x. If we raise tlie last digit of xâ€ž by a single unit and 
call the resulting decimal fraction x,/, then xâ€ž' will be greater than x, so 
that 

(1) xâ€ž<x<xâ€ž'. 

Since the difference between a:â€ž' and arâ€ž is equal to just one unit of the 
?ith decimal place, that is, to 1/10", and since n may be taken arbitrarily 
great, we may make the differences x â€” x^ and xâ€ž' â€” x as small as we 
please by choosing n large enough. 

In the same way, a second surd y may be inclosed between two 
decimal fractions, y^ and yâ€ž', differing from each other by 1/10", so that 

(2) //â€ž < .V < !/n- 

From the monotonic law of addition we can now conclude that 

(3) Xn + //â€ž <:x + y< x,/ f y,/- 

Since xâ€ž' differs from xâ€ž by 1/10", and y,,' differs from yâ€ž by 1/10", xâ€ž' + yâ€ž' 
differs from xâ€ž + //â€ž by 2/10", and x + //, according to (3), can differ from 
either xâ€ž + yâ€ž or x,/ + //â€ž' at most by something less than 2/10". But this 
can be made as small as we please by choosing Â« large enough. Thus we 
conclude that the approximate value of a sum nf two surds may be found 
with any desired degree of precision, by using approximate values for the 
surds themselves which are sufficiently close approximations. 

* Article 77 may be omitted without destroying the continuity. 



118 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 78 

Corresponding theorems can be established for the difference, product, 
or quotient of two surds, and it is in this way that the methods, ordi- 
narily used for calculating with surds, are justified theoretically. 

Exactly similar theorems hold, not only for qiiadratic surds, but also 
for irrational numbers of any kind. To prove this it is only necessary 
to show that for any irrational number x, decimal fractions a;â€ž and xâ€ž' 
exist, with n digits to the riglit of the decimal point, such that 

(4) x,/ - xâ€ž = â€” , xâ€ž < X < xâ€ž'. 

This may be shown as follows. The irrational number may be repre- 
sented by a certain line-segment on the x-axis. (See Art. 15.) Apply 
to it a segment of unit length. Suppose that this unit segment is con- 
tained in X, i times, and let r be the remainder. Then i is the integral 
part of X, and r is the^ fractional part. Apply to r a line-segment 1/10 of 
a unit long ; let it be contained a times in r, and let r' be the remainder. 
Then . 

X â€” I -\ â–  + ?â€¢', r'<â€” . 

10 ^10 

Apply to r' a line-segment xo^ of a unit long. Suppose it is contained h 
times in r' and let r" be the remainder. Then 

10 100 102 

Proceeding in this way we may find a decimal number a:â€ž, smaller than 
X, but differing from x by less than 1/10" where n may be made as great 
as we please. The remainder will never be zero if x is irrational, since 
evei-y terminating decimal is a rational number. If we raise the last 
digit of xâ€ž by one unit, the resulting number x,/ will be greater than x, 
and we shall have found the two numbers xâ€ž and x,/ mentioned in (4). 

78. Interpretation of negative, fractional, and complex roots 
in concrete problems. Many concrete problems lead to quad- 
ratic functions and quadratic equations. In every concrete 
problem we know beforehand what kind of things we are 
talking about, so that we can state beforehand whether the 
unknown quantity x whose value we are seeking ought, in 
the nature of things, to come out as an integer, or whether 
fractional, negative, or even imaginary values may also be 
admissible. Thus, if x represents a sum of money, expressed 
in dollars, x may be positive or negative according as the 
transaction considered involves credit or debit, profit or loss. 
If a; represents the number of yards in a piece of cloth, nega-

tive values of x would be excluded. But if a: is a symbol 
which stands for a vector (see Art. 23), complex values of x 
are just as admissible as real values. 

A quadratic equation always has two roots. If the equa- 
tion has been obtained as a result of the mathematical formu- 
lation of a concrete problem, the question always arises : Do 
both of the roots of this equation, which may be positive, 
zero, or negative, real or complex, actually represent solu- 
tions of our concrete problem, or does only one of them 
represent such a solution, or finally does neither of them 
give a solution of the concrete problem ? This question can 
only be decided by a discussion of the nature of the concrete 
problem which is under consideration. Our common sense 
will tell us whether a negative, or a fractional, or a complex 
value of X has any significance in such a concrete problem ; 
whether more than one value is admissible ; and if not, 
which of the two roots is the correct solution of the problem. 
Finally, if neither of the two roots should turn out to be 
admissible, the problem has no solution.

79. Uniform motion along a straight line. One of the 

most important applications of linear and quadratic func- 
tions is concerned with motion. We have already solved 
some problems involving motion in Exercise XIII, but we 
shall now discuss the questions involved more fully. 

Let us think of the point P in Fig. 38 as being in motion 
along the line AC and let its velocity v be constant. The 
point is then said to be in uniform motion 
*^ ^y^ along a straight line. We count time in 

seconds from some convenient moment on, 
(say 6 A.M.). At the time ^q (that is t^ 



N 



AO 




Ml â€” M '^'^ seconds after 6 A.M.) let the moving point 

be at Pm and let t denote the time when 



Fig. 38 



0' 



the point has reached the position P. 
Then, the time which has elapsed between these two instants 
is i â€” ^Q, and we shall have 

(1) P,P=v(t-t,) (Art. 45) 

Let us denote the coordinates of Pq and P, referred to any 
convenient system of rectangular axes, by (a:^, t/q) and (x, y) 
respectively, so that 

OM, = X,, M,P, = y,. 0M= X, MP = y, 

'^ / M^M= X - x^. N^N = y-y,. 

Since P moves with a constant velocity v along the line 
A (7, the projections, itf and iV, of P upon the x-axis and ?/-axis 
will also move with constant velocities. Let us adopt the 
suggestive notations v^ and Vy for these constant velocities. 
They are called the a;-component and ^/-component of the 
velocity of P and, according to Art. 26, we have the relation 

(3) ^;2 = ^^2+^^2 

between the three velocities v, v^., and Vy. 



Akt. 80] MOTIOX OX A STRAIGHT LINE 121 

The same argument which led us to equation (1) now 
shows us that 

whence we obtain, by substituting for MqM and iV^JV their 
values from (2), 

(4) x = xq + v^(t - to), :y = Â«/o + Vyit - 1^}. 

If we begin to count time from the instant when P is at 
Pq (any convenient place in the path of P), we shall have 
t^ = 0, and equations (4) may be written more simply as 
follows 

(5) x = XQ-\-v,t ij = y^ + vj,. 

Equations (4) or (5) enable us to calculate the coordinates 
(r, ?/) of a point P, which is moving with a constant velocity 
alon;/ a straight line. 

These equations are of great importance in mechanics. 
According to one of Newton's laws of motion, they repre- 
sent the motion of a body upon which no forces are acting. 
Such a body will not move at all if it was at rest to begin 
with, in which case v^ and Vy are both equal to zero. But if 
in some way, before our study of the motion began, the body 
had received an impulse giving it a certain velocity, New- 
ton's law asserts that it will continue to move with this same 
velocity along a straight line, just as long as there is no force 
tending to increase or diminish its velocity or to pull the 
body out of its rectilinear path. 

Ordinary experience at first sight seems to contradict this law. This 
is due to the fact that we never actually see a body upon which no forces 
are acting. If such omnipresent forces as gravity, friction, resistance of 
the air, etc., are at least partially removed or balanced in skillfully ar- 
ranged experiments, the contradiction with experience is found to dis- 
appear. 

80.* Force. Tf a stone is thrown into the air, it does not 
describe a rectilinear i)ath with constant velocity. Accord- 
ing to Newton's law just quoted there must therefore be a 

* Article 80 may be omitted without interrupting the continuity. 



122 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 80 

force acting upon it. This force is known as gravity and is 
always directed downward. If a stone be attached to a 
coiled spring, gravity will cause the stone to stretch the 
spring. Now we may also stretch the spring by our own 
muscular efforts, that is, by means of our muscular force, 
and this is the reason that we speak of gravity as being a 
force. It produces the same kind of effect upon the stone as 
though we were pulling it down with a certain muscular force. 
We may use such a coiled spring to compare and measure 
forces. After we have chosen a certain coiled spring as stand- 
ard, we may agree that the unit of force is that which 
stretches the spring by one millimeter. We may then say 
that the numerical measure of a certain force is F^ if that 
force stretches the spring F millimeters.* By measuring 
the stretching effect of various masses upon the spring, the 
following experimental law is found. The force which grav- 
ity exerts upon a body is proportional to the mass of the body. 
But the force which gravity exerts upon a body is called its 
iveight. Therefore, the iveight of a body is proportional to its 
mass. 

Thus, if one body has twice the mass of another, it will also have 
twice the weight. But the weight of a body is not the same thing as its 
mass. The mass is a number which tells us how many bodies of unit 
mass it takes to counterbalance a given body on a scale with equal arms. 
(See Art. 43.) The weight is the numerical measure of the force which 
gravity exerts upon the body, and may be measured by the stretching 
effect of the body upon a coiled spring. The mass of a body remains the 
same when the body is carried from one place to any other in the uni- 
verse. Its weight, that is, its stretching effect, would change if it were 
carried far away from the earth, since the attractive force of the earth 
(which is the cause of gravity) becomes less as the distance from the 
earth's center increases. 

Let us now attach a unit of mass (a gram perhaps) to our 
standard coiled spring. Let the number of millimeters by 
which this unit of mass stretches the spring be called /. 

* The unit of force introduced in this way is altogether arbitrary. It is used 
here temporarily, merely for the purposes of exi)lanation, aiid will be replaced 
by the customary units of force presently. 



Art. 80] FORCE 123 

Then/ represents the weight of a unit of mass measured in 
terms of the temporary unit of force chosen above. (Our 
temporary unit of force is the force which stretches the 
standard spring by one millimeter.) Since the weight of a 
body is proportional to its mass, the weight of a body of 
mass m will then be mf. In other words : mf will he the 
measure of the gravitational force which pulls a body of mass m 
doivnward, if f is the measure of the corresponding force for a 
body whose mass is equal to unity. 

A second one of Newton's laws of motion says that the 
effect of a force upon a moving body is an acceleration ; that 
is, a change either in tlie magnitude or direction of its veloc- 
ity, or both. More specifically this law may be stated as 
follows : 

1. Tlie acceleration produced by a force is always in the 
direction of the force. 

2. The mag)iitude of the acceleration is directly proportional 
to the magnitude of the force. 

3. The magnitude of the acceleration is inversely propor- 
tional to the mass of the body upon which it is acting. 

Thus, the acceleration due to gravity is always directed vertically 
downward, so that the horizontal component of the motion is not altered 
at all by the effect of gravity. If one of two forces is twice as great as 
the other, it will produce twice as great an acceleration, if the body upon 
which the forces are acting remains the same. Finally, the same force, 
acting upon two different masses, one twice as great as the other, -will 
produce an acceleration ujjon the greater mass just half as great as that 
which it produces upon the smaller mass. 

If we use the language of variation, we may state this 
law as follows. The direction of the acceleration produced 
by a force upon a body is the same as that of the force. If 
^represents the magnitude of the force, m that of the mass 
upon which it is acting, and a that of the acceleration which 
it produces, then a varies directly as F and inversely as m. 
Thus we have 

(1) a = k-, 

m 



124 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS [Art. 80 

where k is the constant of variation. Since a reduces to k 
when F and m are each equated to unity, it follows that k is 
the acceleration produced by a unit force acting upon a unit 
mass. Consequently the numerical value of k depends upon 
our choice of the units of force and mass, and may be altered 
by changing to different units. We now propose to do this 
in such a way as to make k equal to unity, so that (1) 
becomes 

F 

(2) a = â€”OYF=ma. 

m 

To insure the validity of these equations (2), ive must define as 
unit of force that force tvhich, acting upon a unit of mass, pro- 
duces a unit of acceleration. For equations (2) give F=l 
when m = l and a = 1. 

Since w is a mass and a an acceleration whose dimension 
is L/T^ (Art. 46), equation (2) shows that the dimension of 
a force is given by the symbol ML/ T^. 

We proceed to apply equation (2) to the action of gravity. 
The downward force exerted by gravity upon a body of 
mass m was found to be mf if / denoted the force exerted 
by gravity upon a body of mass unity. To be sure, we 
based our justification of this fact upon measurements in 
which we used our first unit of force (the force which 
stretches the standard spring by one millimeter). But this 
relation will still remain true whatever unit of force we may 
be using, the only effect of a change in the unit of force 
being to multiply/ and mfhj the same factor. According 
to (2) the acceleration produced by gravity upon a body of 
mass m will therefore be 

fm 



m 



=/. 



But the acceleration produced by gravity is usually denoted 
by g (Art. 48) and may be measured by simple experiments, 
as has already been pointed out in Art. 48. If we use the 
foot and second as units of length and time we have very 
nearly ^^ = 32.2. If we use the unit of force implied by 



Akt 8U] force 125 

equations (2), /'will therefore also be equal to 32.2. Thus 
we have the following result: 

If the foot and second are taken as units of length and time, 
and if the unit of force is that force which produces a unit 
acceleration when acting upon a unit of mass, then the force 
with which gravity/ pulls a unit of mass downward will be equal 
to 82.2 of these force units. 

If we denote the number o2.2, as is customary, by g, 
equation (2) shows that the tveight tv of a mass m is equal 
to mg, or 

(3) w = mg, 

since the weight is the force which gravity exerts upon the 
mass. Moreover this equation will hold only if the weight 
is expressed in terms of a unit of force which is related to the 
unit of mass in the manner just indicated. 

So far we have not specified any particular unit of mass, 
and therefore no unit of force has as yet been defined 
specifically. Let us take the pound as unit of mass. Then 
the unit of force will be that force which, acting upon a mass 
of one pound, will produce an acceleration of one foot per 
second per second. This unit of force is called a poundal. 
Clearly the pound as a unit of mass, and the poundal as a 
unit of force are very different things. Finally, the weight 
of a pound is different from either of these. The weight of 
a pound according to (3) is equal to 32.2 of those force units 
which we have agreed to call poundals. Since tliis weight 
is a force, it may also be used as a unit of force. This unit 
of force, the weight of a pound, is called a pound of force. 
Thus 

(4) one pound of force = 32.2 poundals 

where one poundal is the force which, acting upon a mass of one 
pound, produces an acceleration of one foot per second per 
second. 

By means of (4) it is easy to convert forces expressed in 
pounds into poundals and vice versa.

81. Motion of a projectile under the influence of gravity. 

In Fig. 39 let the positive ^-axis be directed vertically 
upward, and let the a;-axis be a horizontal line in the plane 

of the curved path 
described by a pro- 
jectile which starts 
from the point Pq 
whose coordinates 
are (% ?/y). Let 
V^ and Vy be the 
components of the 
initial velocity V 
and let us count time (in seconds) from the moment in which 
the projectile begins its flight. If gravity were not acting, 
the projectile would after t seconds reach a point whose co- 
ordinates are (compare equations (5) Art. 79) 

The action of gravity has no effect upon the first of 
these two equations, which represents the horizontal com- 
ponent of the motion ; but it will cause the projectile to 
be in a lower position at every instant than it would oc- 
cupy if gravity were not acting. This eifect of gravity 
is taken care of by addition of the term â€” \ gt"^ to the 
right member of the second equation.* Thus we obtain the 
equations

x = Xq+ Vj, y = yQ+Vyt- i yt\ 



which enable us to compute the coordinates of the projectile, t 
seconds after the beginning of its flight, provided that it has not 
struck an obstacle in the meantime. 

In using tliese equations, V^ and Vy are positive or negative according 
as these velocity components have the directions of the positive or nega- 
tive X- and 7/-axes. 

* We are not attempting to prove this statement. The term â€” ^ gt^ represents 
the distance through which the projectile would have fallen in the time t if it had 
been dropped i'roiu Fq without any initial velocity.

gravity as being the same at every point of the path of the 
projectile.

CHAPTER IV 

INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF THE nth ORDER. 
NUMERICAL CALCULATION OF THEIR REAL ZEROS 

82. Calculation of the numerical values of an integral rational 
function. A function is said to he an integral rational function 
of the nth order, if it can he expressed in the form 

(1) y = Ax^ + ^.r"-i + (7x"-2 + ... + Lx + M 

where n is a positive integer and where the coefficients A, B, (7, 
â€¢ â€¢â€¢ i, M are constants. 

Thus, an integral rational function of x is composed of a 
finite number of terms, each of these terms being a product of 
a constant by a power of x with a finite positive integer as 
exponent. The order or degree of such a function is de- 
termined by the exponent of the highest power of x which 
actually occurs in it. The linear and quadratic functions, 
discussed in the preceding chapters, are integral rational 
functions of the first and second order respectively. 

The method used in Chapters II and III, for representing 
a linear or quadratic function geometrically by a graph, may 
be applied to an integral rational function of the wth order 
as well. It is evident that the abscissas of those points 
where the graph crosses the 2;-axis will be the real roots of 
the equation of the nth order obtained by equating to zero 
the function (1). Consequently the construction of the 
gi'aph of such a function will give, by inspection, either the 
exact or the approximate values of the real roots of an 
equation of the wth order. 

Tlie construction of the graph of such a function is really 
no more difficult than for a linear or quadratic function, but 

129 



130 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 82 

the calculations required are a little longer. We shall there- 
fore explain first a simple method for calculating the value 
of a function of the form (1) for a given value of x. 

It will suffice to explain this method for the case of a 
function of the third order (a cubic function), 

(2) y = A3^-\- Bx^ -\- Cx+D. 

To compute the value of (2) for x= a^ we first multiply A 
by a and add B to the product. Let the result be called E, 
so that 

(3) Aa+ B = E. 

We then multiply E by a and add C. Let the result be 
called F, so that 

(4) Ea + C = {Aa + By + 0=Aa^- + Ba+ C = F. 

We repeat this operation once more, obtaining 

(5) Fa + D=iAa^ + Ba+C~)a+D = Aa^ + Ba^+Ca + D=a. 

But this is precisely the quantity whose value we wished to 
calculate, that is, Gr is the value of the function (2) for 
X = a. 

The calculation may therefore be arranged as follows : 

(6) A B O D [a 

Aa Ea Fa 

^ ^ a' 

Thus, if we wish to calculate the value of 3 a;^ â€” 4 x^ + 7 x â€” 2 for 
x = -2,wewrit^ 3 - 4 + 7 - 2 [-2 
_ 6 +20 - 54

Giving â€” 56 as the result, which may be verified directly. 

It should be remembered, in applying this method, that if 
any one of the terms of Ax^ + Bx^ -\- Cx â– \- D i^ absent, the 
corresponding column in the calculation (6) must not be

omitted. The missing term should be written with zero as 
its coefficient. 

This proce^', which is applicable to integral rational 
functions of any degree, is very important and should be 
used in connection with the following examples.

Make graphs for the following functions, and find either exact or 
approximate values of their zeros by inspecting the graph. (Approxi- 
mations to the nearest half unit are sufficient.)

83. The functional notation. It is often convenient to 
have a short notation for a given function of x. Thus we 
may write ^ _ â€ž . â€ž 

and we can then express the result of the calculation at the 
end of Art. 82 very briefly by saying that 

/(-2)=-56. 

The symbol /(a;) is read the f -function of x. In any specific 
example /(a;) stands for a definitely given function of x. In 
different examples /(a:) may stand for different functions. 
If several different functions occur in the same example, we 
may denote them by /(a;), g(x)., A (a:), etc., or by /i(a;), 
/2(x-), fz(x)-, etc. The symbol f(x) does not mean / multi- 
plied by X.

ratic function ; and that a quadratic function of a linear function of x 
is a quadratic function of x. 

8. Show that a quadratic function of a quadratic function of x is a 
function of the fourth degree. 

84. The factor theorem. We have already noticed that a 
quadratic function which has a: â€” a as a factor vanishes for 
2J = a, and conversely, that if a quadratic function vanishes 
for x= a^ then it has x â€” a as a factor. (See Art. 68.) 
We shall now show that a corresponding theorem, known 
as the factor theorem, holds for integral rational functions 
of any order. 

If X â€” a is a factor of an integral rational function f (x^, the 
function will assume the valUe zero when x is equated to a. Con- 
versely^ if such a function f (^x) becomes equal to zero for x =â–  a^ 
thenf(x) has x â€” a as a factor. 

The proof of the first part of this theorem is immediate. 
If /(a;) has a; â€” a as a factor, we may write 

f(x) = {x-a>^g(x), 

where ^(2;), the other factor of /(a;), is an integral rational 
function of x whose degree will be less by a unit than that 
oif(x). If in this equation, we put a: = a, the factor x â€” a 
becomes equal to zero, and the other factor becomes equal 
to^(Â«), which will be some finite number. Consequently 
the product will vanish, so that /(a) = 0, as we wished to 
prove. 

To prove the converse, let 

n ) fix) = Ax^ + 5a:"-i + 6V-2 + ... ^Lx^^Mx^N. 



Art. 84] THE FACTOR THEOREM 133 

According to the hypothesis, the value of this function for 
x= a^ that is,/(rt), is equal to zero. Therefore we have 

(2) /(a)=^a" + ^a"-i+ Ca"-2 + ... +La^ + Ma + N=Q. 
We may therefore write 

(3) /(2-)=/(2^)-/(a)=^(2;Â»-aÂ») + 5(xÂ»-i-a'Â»-i)4- â€¢â€¢. 

+ Lix^ - 0^)+ M(x- a). 

Each of the last two binomial terms of (3) obviously has 
a: â€” a as a factor: We shall show immediately that the same 
thing is true of each of the other binomial terms of (3). 
Consequently, f(x^ has a: â€” a as a factor, as was to be proved. 

In order to complete the proof of this theorem it only re- 
mains to show that, for every value of the positive integer n, 
z" â€” a" has x â€” a as a factor. 

We know that this is true for n = 1 and for n = 2, since 

a: â€” a = (a; â€” a) â€¢ 1 , x^ â€” a^ = (x â€” a)(x + a^. 

It may be verified easily that it is also true for 7i = 3, since 

x^ â€” a^ = (^x â€” a) {x^ + ax + a^), 

as may be seen by performing the multiplication on the right 
member and simplifying. To prove that this theorem is true 
for all values of w, we first prove the following lemma, or 
auxiliary theorem. 

If x^ â€” a^ ha^ x â€” a as a factor^ so does x^""^ â€” a'^'^^. 
Proof. \Vc may write

Since the last term, rt*(a- â€” a), has x â€” a as a factor, the whole 
right member, which is equal to x^ ^ â€” a''"'\ will have xâ€”a 
as a factor if x'^ â€” a''' has such a factor, lint this remark 
proves tlie lemma. 

Now 2;2 â€” a^ has a- â€” a as a factor. A first application of 
the lemma (for ^ = 2) sliows that ;r^+^ â€” a-'*"^ or .x^ â€” a^ also 



134 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 85 

has Xâ€” a as a factor. A second application of the lemma 
(to the case A; = 3) shows that a;* â€” a* has a; â€” a as a factor. 
We may proceed in this way until we reach re" â€” a", thus 
proving that x^ â€” a" has a; â€” a as a factor. 

The method of proof just employed is called the method 
of mathematical induction, and is very important in all parts 
of mathematics. We shall have occasion to apply this 
method frequently during this course. 

85. The remainder theorem. The following theorem, 
known as the remainder theorem, includes tXvd factor theorem 
as a special case. 

If an integral rational function f(^x) be divided hy x â€” a 
until a remainder independent of x is obtained^ this remainder 
is equal tof(^a^, the value of the function f(^x^ for x = a. 

Proof. Carry out the process of dividing /(a^) hjx â€” a 
until we reach a remainder M independent of x, and let the 
quotient obtained by this division be called Qi^x). Accord- 
ing to the definition of the terms division, quotient, and 
remainder (see Art. 4), this means that we shall have 

(1) flx)=Q(:xX^-a)+B, 

where i^ is a constant whose value does not depend upon x, and 
where Q^x} will be of degree w â€” 1 if /(a^) is of degree n.* 

Let us now put ;r = a in (1). Since Q{x^ is an integral 
rational function of ;r, (?(Â«) is a finite number, and we find 
from (1) 

(2) /(a)= Q(a) .0 + B=E. 

But (2) is nothing more or less than the remainder theorem 
which we wished to prove. 

In the particular case when M=0, we obtain from (1) 
and (2) the factor theorem ; saying that if /(a) = 0, then 
/(a;) has X â€” a as a factor, and conversely. Thus we have 
found incidentally a new proof of the factor theorem. 

* This process shows that /(x) may be written in the form (1) and does 
not involve any actual division until we write 



Art. SG] synthetic DIVISION 135 

86. Synthetic division. Tlie remainder theorem shows us 
lliut if we divide f(^x) by a; â€” a, the remainder is equal to 
/(a). But in Art. 82 we found a convenient method for 
calculating the value of /(a). We may therefore use this 
same method for calculating the remainder in the division 
oif(x) by Xâ€” a. But this calculation will at the same time 
give us the value of the quotient. To see this, let us apply 
the ordinary process of long division to the problem of divid- 
ing Ax^ + Bx^ + Cx + D by j- â€” a, and then let us compare 
with Art. 82. We find 

Ai^ + Bx'^ + Ox + D x-a 
Ax^ - A ax^ I Ai^ + Ex + F 

Ux^'+ Ox 
Bx^- - Eax 

Fx + D 
Fx - Fa 

Fa + B=a = R 

The term Fx^ is first Â« obtained in- the form Aax^ -{- Bx^ 
= {Aa + B}x'^, but according to the notation used in (8) 
Art. 82, this is the same as Fx^. Similarly the term Fx 
arises from (Fa + 0)x which, according to (4) Art. 82, is 
equal to Fx. 

If now we write down once more the scheme for the 
calculation explained in Art. 82, namely 

A B a B [a 

Aa Fa Fa 

A F F B~=f(a), 

we notice that the first three numbers of the last line, A, E, 
and F, are the coefficients of x\ x, and 1, in the quotient, 
whereas M is the remainder. 

As applied to the example f(x) = 3 x^ â€” i x'^ + 7 x â€” 2, which was 
used at the end of Art. 82 as an illustration, we see from the numbers 
obtained there that the quotient obtained, when 3 x^ â€” 4 x^ + 7 x â€” 2 is 
divided by x â€” (- 2) = x + 2, will be S x^ - 10 x + 27, and the remainder 
will be â€” 56. This calculation has been written out in just this form in 
Art. 82. 



136 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 87 

This method of dividing an integral rational function by 
a; â€” a is far more convenient than the ordinary method. It 
is known as the method of synthetic division. Synthetic 
division may be performed according to the following rule. 

1. To divide f(x) by x â€” a, arrmige f(x') in descending 
powers of X. 

2. Write the coefficients of /(x) on a horizontal line, in the 
order ivhich corresponds to the arrangement specified in No. 1 
of this rule. If any power of x is missing inf(x)., supply that 
power with a zero coefficient. 

3. Multiply the first coefficie7it A by a, write the product 
beloiv the second coefficient B, and add. Multiply this sum E 
by a, ivrite the product below the third coefficient (7, and add. 

4. Proceed in this umy until all of the places in the third 
row except the first are filled up, and ivrite down the first coef- 
ficie7it A of f(x') in the first place of the third roiv. The last 
number of the third row will be the retnainder., and the other 
numbers in the third row will be the coefficients of the quotient 
obtained when f(x) is divided by x â€” a. 

EXERCISE XXXIV 

Find the quotient and remainder in the following divisions. Use the 
method of synthetic division. 

1. Divide 2 x^ + 5 a;^ - 7 x + 1 by a; - 3. 

2. Divide .3 a.-^ - 7 a;^ + 4 a: - 5 by x + 3. 

3. Divide 2 a;^ + x + 1 by a' - 2. 

4. Divide x^ â€” 1 by x + 2. 

87. The slope of the tangent. When we have drawn the 
graph of an integral rational function y = f{x) by the method 
of computing the coordinates of a large number of its points, 
we can draw the tangent to the curve at any one of its points 
with some degree of approximation. We wish, however, to be 
in a position to draw the tangent with greater accuracy, and 
this desire leads us to adopt a precise detinition for a tangent 
and, in this way, to seek a precise method for its determination. 



Art. 87] 



THE SLOPE OF THE TANGENT 



137 



We define a tangent to a curve as follows : 

Let Pj be any point on a given curve {see Fig. 40), and let 
P^ be a second point (^distinct from Pj) of the same curve. As 
Pg approaches P^ as a limit, the line PiP^ (sometimes called 
a secant of the curve} will turn around Pj as a center. If the 
secant approaches a limiting position P^T as P^ approaches 
Pj, this limiting position of the secant is called the tangent of 
the curve at P^, and J\ is called its point of contact. 

This detiuitiou ie(iiiires a few words of explanation. In the fir.st 
place it presiii)poses the notion of limits which the student has discussed 
to some extent in his earlier 
courses in elementary algebra 
and geometry. A more detailed 
discussion of this important 
subject will be given later in 
this book. (See Chapter XV.)* 
In the second place it is essen- 
tial to remember that the line 
PiP., is regarded as unbounded. 
We are not talking about the 
line-segnient Px^r ^^^li^'l' <jÂ£ 
course approaches zero when 
Pi approaches Pj, but of the 
whole line upon which this seg- 
ment is located. Finally, when 
we say that Pg shall approach Pj, it should be understood that, during 
this approach, P, must always remain on the given curve and that it 
must reTuain distinct from Pi but that it may approach Pj from the 
right, or from the left, through positions which are partly to the right 
and partly to the left of Pp either continuously or by jumps. 

Let us now denote the coordinates of Pj and P^ by (.r, ,y) 
and (x + h, y + k) respectively, and let the given curve be 
the graph of y =f{x). Then, the ordinate of every point of 
the curve (the y of that point) will be equal to the /-func- 
tion of the abscissa (the x of that point). Thus we shall 

have 

y =/(x), y+k =f(x + A), 




Fig. 40 



* If the instructor prefers, part or all of this chapter on limits may be inserted 
here before proceeding farther. 



138 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 87 

since y + k \^ the ordinate and x -{â–  h the abscissa of P^. The 
slope of the secant PiP<y, will be, according to Art. 53, 

(1) ^^ = y + ^- y ^ f(^-^ ^0 - ./'C-O .

y = M^Pâ€ž y + k = M^P.-,, k = QP.. 

,, , QPo 

so that m = v,â€” ?â€¢ 

PiQ 

If now we let P^ approach Pj as a limit, h will approach 
the limit zero, and the slope of the secant will in general 
approach as its limit the slope of tlie tangent to the curve at 
Py Thus we obtain the following result : 

Theorem I. Consider the curve which is obtained as the 
graph of the function y =f(x'), and let P^ he any particular 
point on that curve which has a uniquely determined tanqeMt, 
not parallel to the y-axis. Then the slope of the tangent of this 
curve at the point P^ is equal to the limit ivhich the quotient 

fCx+h^-f(x) 
h 
approaches^ ivhen h approaches zero, if x denotes the abscissa of 
the point P^ 

The condition that the curve shall have a Tiniquely determined tangent 
at Pj has been mentioned so as to exclude such points as A in Fig. 41. 
The condition that the tangent shall not be parallel to 
the y-axis has been put in, because a line parallel to the 
^\^ y-axis cannot be said to have a slope. (See Art. 53.) 

-â– 1 In neither of these cases has the quotient 



"* /(x+A)-/(x) 

Fig. 41 ^ 

a unique finite limit. However, we shall see later that these exceptional 
cases never occur iif(x) is an integral rational function of x. 

Unless the graph of y=:f(x) is a straight line, that is, 
unless /(a;) happens to be a linear function, the slope of the 
tangent will be different for different points of the curve. 



Art. ST] DERIVATIVE OF A FUNCTION 139 

Consequently tlie limit mentioned in Theorem I will, in 
general, be a variable function of x. This new function of x 
derived from the function /(a;) by a definite limit process, is 
called the derivative of /(x), and is usually denoted by /'(a;). 
We may therefore write the following statement which may 
be regarded as a definition of the derivative of a given function. 

TJie function fX-^) ivhich is obtained from a given function 
f (i-) hy first forminy the quotient 

fix + /Q -f(x-) 
h 

and then ohtaininy the limit tvhich this quotient approaches 
when h approaches zero^ is called the derivative off(x'). 
In symbols this definition may be formulated as follows : 

(2) f'(x)=lim-L(^Â±JO-f('^\ 

where the right member of this equation is to be read : limit of 
the fraction, f{j- + h)â€”f(x) divided by h, as h approaches 
zero. 

If we use this terminology, Theorem I may now be re- 
formulated as follows : 

Theorem II. Let us consider the graph of the function 
y =f{x) and letf'(x) be the derivative of f{x). If we give a 
definite numerical value to x and compute the value of the 
derivative f {x) for this value of x, the result ivill he equal to the 
slope of that tangent of the curve whose point of contact has this 
given value of x as its abscissa, provided that the point of eon- 
tact is one where the curve actually possesses a unique tangent 
which is not parallel to the y-axis. 

The notion of a derivative was introduced into mathematics, nearly 
simultaneously and probably independently, by the great English mathe- 
matician and physicist Siu Isaac Newton (1643-1727) and by the 
famous German philosopher and mathematician G. VV. Leibniz (1646- 
171G). This notion is the fundamental concept of the Differential Cal- 
culus.

INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS 



[Art. 87 



The following illustration will make this process clearer. Let 
f{x) â€” x^, so that the graph considered will be tiie parabola obtained 
by making the graph of 

y = A 

and let us compute the slope of that tangent of 
the parabola whose point of contact has the ab- 
scissa X = 3/2 and whose ordinate will therefore 
hey= (3/2)^ = 9/4. 
AVe have, in this case, 




/(f) = I, 



+ 2 (I) A + /<2, 



so that according to (1) 



= ^ + h 



is the slope of tliat secant determined by those two points on the parabola 
whose abscissas are equal to | and | + h respectively. As h approaches 
zero, m will approach the limit 3. Therefore the slope of the tangent of 
the parabola at the point (3/2, 9/4) is equal to 3. 

More generally, we may, according to Theorem II, by finding the 
derivative of /'(x) = a;-, compute the slope of the tangent at cnui point of 
the parabola. This slope will be equal to 

f'(j-) = lim*^â€” ^^ J- â€” ^ = lim -^^ ^ , 



hm â€” Z J: = ]i,n -T â€” = ii,â€ž (^x + h), 



f'(x) 

or finally y(x)=2x. 

Thus, if we consider any point on the paral)nla whose abscissa has a 
given value x, and construct the tangent at that point, the slope of this 
tangent will be equal to 2 x. 

In the particular case when x = 3/2 we find the slope to be twice 3/2 
or 3 as before.

ing integral rational functions, that is, functions of the form 

y =fix) = Ax" + Bx'"' + ...â– +Lx+ M, 

and the graphs of such functions. If we wish to be in a 
position to draw the tangent to snch a graph at any one of 
its points we must, according to Art. 87, calculate the 
derivative of /(a;). In order to do this, we must first com- 
pute the value of 

f(x + h) = A(x + hy + B(x + hY-^ + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + L(x + h) + M, 

then form the difference /(a; + h^ â€”/(a:), divide this differ- 
ence by A, and finally evaluate tlie limit which this quotient 
approaches when h approaches zero. But before we can 
carry out this program, we must first learn how to calculate 
the terms {x + A)", (x -f hy~\ etc., which occur in the above 
expression for /(a; -f A). 

The general formula for (^x -f A)" which wc shall now 
derive is commonly known as the binomial theorem and is 
due to Sir Isaac Newton. We shall prove it by making 
use of tlie method of mathematical induction which we have 
already used in Art. 84.

142 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 88 

Careful inspection of tliese special cases suggests that the following 
laws are probably true. 

1. The expansion of (.r + //)" contains n + 1 terms. 

2. The first term will be x". 

3. The second term will be ?u;"~Vt. 

4. The tliird term will be "-^^^â€”^ â€” ^x"~-h-. The numerical coefficient 

of this term may be obtained from the second term by multiplying its 
coefficient /( l)y the exponent of x in that term, namely n â€” 1, and divid- 
ing the product by 2, which is the number of the term. 

5. The fourth term will be 

"(^-l)("--)x"-3R

The numerical coefficient of the fourth term may be obtained from the 
third term by multiplying its coefficient, "^" ~^ ^ , by the exponent of 

.X- in that teriii, namely 7i - 2, and dividing by 3, the number of the 
term. 

6. If we multiply the coefficient of any term by the exponent of the 
power of X which occurs in tliat term, and divide the product by the 
number of the term, we obtain the numerical coefficient of the next 
term.

The numerical coefficient of this term has the form of a fraction whose 
denominator is a product of /â€¢ â€” 1 factors, namely, the product of the 
first r â€” 1 integers. The numerator is also a product of r â€” 1 factors, 
namely the r â€” 1 integers n, n â€” \, â€¢â€¢â€¢ n â€” (/â€¢ â€” 2) which are obtained by 
subtracting in order 0, 1, 2 â€¢â€¢â€¢?â€¢ â€” 2 from n. 

8. The last or (n + l)"" term is equal to h". But it will also be in- 
cluded under formula (2) if there we put ?â€¢ = n -f- 1, provided that we 
make the agreement that the symbol ./" shall be regarded as equivalent 
to unity, that is, x" = 1.

and the truth of tliis formula, which is called the binomial

So far, we only know that the formula is correct for 
w=l, 2, 3, 4, 5. We wish to show that it is correct for all 
values of the positive integer n. In order to do this we 
prove the following lemma. 

If the binomial theorem (3) is correct for n = k, it ivill also 
he correct for n = k + \. 

Proof. The hypothesis of the lemma is that formula (3)

Thus we have actually proved that if the rth term of the 
expansion of (a: + hy is c^iven by fornri'ula (2) for n = k, then 
the rth term in (x -{â–  A)'-+^ will be given by this same formula 
for n = k-lt-^- Since the rth term represents ani/ term of 
the expansion, we liave actuall}'' proved our lemin:i : if the 
binomial formula is correct for n = k, it will also he correct for 
n = k-\-'^. 

But we know that the binomial formula is correct for 
n= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Oar lemma allows us to conclude, without 
actual test, that it will also be true for n = G. A second 
application of the lemma shows the formula to be true for 
w = 7, and so on, for all positive integral values of 7i. 

Formula (2) gives the rth term of the expansion of

+ terms each of which has A as a factor. 

The derivative of f(x) is the limit which (3) approaches 
when h approaches zero (Art. 87). That part of (3) 
which has been written out will remain unchanged as h 
approaches zero, because it contains no h. All of the other 
terms of (3) will have the limit zero since each has A as a 
factor. Therefore, the derivative of the function /(a:), de- 
fined by (1), is

Observe that the law according to which f (x) is obtained 
from f(jjc) is very simple. Each term of /(^) produces a 
corresponding term of f'(x) by applying the following rule: 
Multiply any term of f(x) by the exponent of the power of x 
which occurs in it, and afterward reduce this exponent by unity. 

This rule may even be regarded as applying to the last 
terra M of /(a:), which at first sight seems to be an excep- 
tion, inasmuch as it produces no corresponding terra in f {x). 
For we may think of M as the coefficient of aP = 1. (See 
Art. 88 No. 8 of the fine print.) If we do, the above rule 
will give as the term oi f (x^ which corresponds to the 
term M\nf(x).

1. Solve a second time the examples of Exercise XXXV, making use 
of formula (4), Art. 89, for the purpose of computing the derivatives. 

2. Prove directly that the derivative of a constant is equal to zero. 

90. Derivatives of higher order. We now know how to 
find the derivative f'(x) of any integral rational function 
f(x). \i f(x') is of degree n,f'{x^ is an integral rational 
function of degree n~l. The derivative of /'(a;), denoted 



148 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 91 

by/" (a:), will therefore be an integral rational function of 
degree wâ€” 2, and is called the second derivative of /(a;). 
We may continue in this way. Clearly the kth derivative 
of /(a;) will be an integral rational function of degree 
71 â€” k. In particular the nth derivative of /^a;) will be a 
constant, that is, it will contain no x. The {n + l)th deriva- 
tive and all derivatives of order higher than this will be equal 
to zero. (See Ex. 2, Exercise XXXVII.) 

EXERCISE XXXVIll 

Compute the derivatives of higher order for all of the functions men- 
tioned in Exercise XXXV. 

91. Taylor's expansion. By making use of the higher 
derivatives we can now write the expansion of f{x+ K) in a 
very simple form. We shall give the details of the proof 
only for the case where /(a;) is of the third order, so that 

(1) / (x) = Ax^ + Bx^ + Gx + i), 

but the same method would apply to an integral rational 
function of ;iny degree. 

Let/' {x),f" (x),f"' (a;), etc., represent the first, second, 
third derivatives, etc., of/ (x). Then we find from (1), 

fix) = 3Ar2 + -lBx+ 0, 
fix) ^6 Ax + 2 B, 
^"^^ . /'"(a:) = 6A 

/4^(a:)=/'5>(a:)= â€¢â€¢. =0. 

Again, we find from (1) 

fix + h) = A<ix + hf+ B{x + hy + C(x + A) + B 

or, if we expand each of these terms by the binomial 
theorem, and arrange according to powers of h, 

QV) f(x+h) = Ax^-\-Bx^+ Cx+B + h{?j Ax^ + 2Bx+ (7) 
+ h\d Ax + B)+ h^A. 

The sum of the first four terms of the right member is 
/(a;) ; the coefficient of h, according to (2), is equal to /'(a;); 
the coefficient of h^ is equal to one half of /"(a:) ; the coeffi-

cient of A^ is equal to one sixth of /'"(a:). We may there- 
fore rewrite (3) as follows: 

(4) /(:r + /0=/(a:) + ^/'(.r)+ ^/''(.r)-f ^-|-^/'''(a:). 

By applying the same method to a function of higher 
degree we obtain the following result : 

Iff(x) is an integral rational function of the nth degree, we 
may express fix + A), as a sum of terms arranged according to 
ascending powers of h, in the form

92. Diminishing the roots of an equation. We have seen 
in Art. 82 how approximate values may be obtained for the 
real roots of an equation 

(1) f{x) = Ax'' + Bx"^^ + -.- + Lx+ M= 0, 

by inspecting the graph of the function y = f(^x'). 

Let us suppose that a is an approximation to a root of (1) 
obtained in this way, and let the exact value of the root be 
X = a -{- h, so that h is the unknown correction (positive or 
negative) wliich must be added to a to insure that a + h 
maybe exactly a root of the eciuation (IV We shall then 
liave 

(2) f(a + h)=0. 



150 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 92 

Thus, the correction h must satisfy the equation (2). But 
this equation is obtained from (1) by writing 

(3) X = a -\- h, ov h = X â€” a. 

Consequently every root h of (2) will be less by a than 
a corresponding root x of (1). We have the following 
result. 

If a is an approximation to a real root of the equation 
f^x^ = 0, the correction h (^positive or negative'^, tvhich makes 
a -\- h exactly a root of the equation, ivill itself satisfy the equa- 
tion f (a + A)= 0, all of whose roots are less hy exactly a than 
the corresponding roots off(x')= 0. 

It is important therefore to be able to determine the equa- 
tion in ^, ^^ , 7\ A 

whose roots differ from those of /(.Â») = by a. The prob- 
lem of obtaining this equation is known as diminishing the 
roots of the given equation hy a. 

But we can solve this problem at once. We need merely 
to put re = a in formula (5) of Art. 91. This gives 

(4) /(a + 70 =/(a) 4- \f\a~) + ^/"(a) + 

1 . 2... n 

as the equation, with h as its unknown, all of lohose roots are less 
hy exactly a than those of the equation /(a') = 0. Both equa- 
tions are of the same order. 

The problem of increasing the roots of an equation by 
a is included in the above, if we admit negative values 
of a. 

Since /(x) is a known function of x,f'(x^,f"(x'), etc., may 
be found by Arts. 89 and 90. Since a is a given number 
f(cL),f'(^a'), etc., may be calculated, and thus the coefficients 
of equation (4) may be determined. It only remains to find 
rules enabling us to perform this calculation conveniently. 



Art. 9:1] ARRANGEMENT OF THE CALCULATION 151 

93. Arrangement of the calculation. In order to accom- 
plish this, we return to tlie calculation explained in Art. 
82. We there found the following method for calculating 
/(a) when 

(1) f(x) = Ai^ + 33^+ Cx + D. 

We put 

(2) E=Aa + B. F = Ea+ C=Aa^ + Ba+ C, 



and arranged the work as follows : 




ABC 


B 


(S) Aa Ea 


Fa 



E F /(a) 

Let us now add Aa to E and call the sum (r, so that 

(3) Aa + E=Aa + {Aa + B') = 2Aa + B=a. 

If we multipl}^ (r by a and add the product to F^ we find, 
making use of (2) and (3), 

(4) Ga + F=2Aa'^ + Ba-^{Aa'^+Ba+ C^ 

= ^Aa^ + 2Ba-\-C. 

But this is equal to /'(a) on account of (2), Art. 91. 
This calculation is actually carried out by adding two new 
lines to the scheme (*S'), which will then read as follows:

9. Work out the details of Art. 93 for the case of a quartic equation,

94. Multiplication of the roots of an equation by m. Let 

X be a root of the equation 

(1) Ax'' + Bx""-^ -\ \- Lx + M= 0, 

and let us attempt to find a second e<iuation, with the un- 
known x\ whose roots are just m times as great as those 
of (1). We shall then have 

(2) x' = mx, x = â€” â€¢

If we substitute this value of x in (1), we find the equation 

a(^\ + ^f^Y"' + ... + //i:! + it/=

for x' . But this may be simplified by multiplying both 
members by tw", giving 

(3) Ax'"" + mBx'""'^ + m^Cx'"''^ + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + m'^-'^Lx' + w"il^= 0. 

We obtain the following rule. To find an equation whose

ivhich does not occur in the equation. Multiply the coefficients 
in order by 1, m, ?n^, wi^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ m". Tlie resulting products are 
the coefficients of the desired equation. 

While this rule is convenient and easy to remember, it is 
still simpler in any given case to actually make the substitu- 
tion (2) which led to the rule. 

95. Changing the sign of the roots. An important special 
case of the transformation just explained arises when m = â€” 1. 
In that case we have x' = â€” x and the roots of the two 
equations 

(1) Ax'^ + Bx""-^ + Gx""-^ + i>:r"-3 + . . . = 

and 

(2) Ax'^ - Bx'--^ + CV"-2 - Dx'""'^ + . . . = 

are so related that, to every root of (1) there corresponds a 
root of (2) of the same magnitude but of opposite sign. 

This transformation is very useful when tve are attempting 
to calculate a negative root of (1), since it enables us to calculate 
instead the corresponding positive root of (^2).

10. It may happen that the transformation of Art. 95 does not change 
the equation at all ; that is, the coeHicients of (1) and (2), Art. 95, may 
be identical. Under what circumstances will this happen, and what can 
you conclude concerning the roots of such an equation? 

96. Continuity of integral rational functions. In calculat- 
ing a real root of an e(jiuitioii of the form 

(1) f(x) = Ax" 4- i^x"-! + -'. + Lx + 31= 0, 

we may proceed as follows. We first make a graph of the 
function 

(2) ^=/(^)- 

The real roots of (1) will be the abscissas of the points in 
which the graph crosses the a;-axis. Suppose that, in mak- 
ing the calculations required for drawing this graph, we 
happen to strike a value of x which 
makes f{x) exactly equal to zero. Then, 
of course, this value of a; is a root of the 
equation. Ordinarily, however, this will 
not occur ; usually none of the values of 
X, say a, b, c, d, etc., which are used in 
these calculations will be roots of the 
equation ; so that the values of /(Â«), f(J>'), 
/(c), etc., will, all of them, be different from zero. Suppose 
/(a) < 0, and f{h) > 0, a case illustrated in Fig. 43, where 

MF =f(a-) < 0, NQ =f{b) > 0. 

The figure leads us to conclude that there will be at least 
one point, between M and iV, where the curve crosses the 
a;-axis. If a^j is the abscissa of such a point, a-^, which lies be- 
tween a and b, will be a root of the equation (1). 

Although this argument sounds very plausible we have, 
so far, no guarantee for its correctness. If the graph of the 
function /(x) is indeed an unbroken (continuous) curve as 
indicated in Fig. 43, the conclusion will be correct. But if 




156 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Akt. 96 

the graph were broken ((liscontiiuious) as in Fig. 44; the 
conclusion might be erroneous. We shall see later that such 
graphs as that of Fig. 44 are not at all 
uncommon, but they never present them- 
\ selves wlien f {x) is an integral function. 

M 1^ ^ It can be shown that the graph of an 

I * integral rational function is always con- 

^ tinuous. 

Fig. 44 

In order that we may express these con- 
ditions somewhat more precisely, we formulate the following 
definition : 

A function f (x) is said to be continuous in the neighborhood of 
a particular value of x^ say x = p^ if the difference 

f(p+h)-f(p) 

approaches zero for its limit, whenever h approaches zero in any 
manner, through positive or negative values, continuously, or by 
jumps. 

If the function is continuous in the neighborhood of all 
values of x which lie between a and b, the function is said to 
be continuous in the interval from a to b. 

The graph of a continuous function will be an unbroken 
(continuous) curve, such as is illustrated in Fig. 43. This 
figure suggests the following theorem. 

I. If the function f (x) is continuous in the interval from a to 
b, and if the values off(^a^ andf(^l)} are opposite in sign, there 
will exist at least one value of x, between a and b, for which the 
function f (^x^ will become equal to zero. 

The argument which we attempted to make, at the be- 
ginning of this article, will therefore be justified if the 
following statement is correct. 

II. An integral rational function of x is continuous in any 
finite interval. 

Theorems I and II are both correct. We shall not however 
attempt to prove them now, since the proofs are somewhat 



Art. 97] NEWTON'S METHOD OF APPROXIMATION 157 

abstract. The discussion just given, and the experience 
which we are gradually gaining in the drawing of graphs, 
will serve to make both theorems seem plausible. 

97. Newton's method of approximation. Let a; be a root of 
the equation f{x)=0 ; let a l)e an approximate value of this 
root, obtained perhaps by inspection of the graph, and let us 
put re = a + A, so that h is the correction whicli must be 
added to a to obtain the true value of the root. According to 
Art. 92, tliis unknown correction h will be a root of the 
equation 

(1) /(a) +/'(Â«)/.+ l/"(a)A2+ ... =0. 

Now, if a is a fairly good approximation to x, h will be a 
comparatively small fraction of a so that the ratios h^/a\ 
h^/a^, etc., will be small as compared with h/a. In most cases, 
therefore, we may expect to get a good approximation to the 
correction h by neglecting the terms which involve A^, Jfi, 
etc., in (1). If we do this, (1) reduces to an equation of the 
first degree for h, namely 

/(a) + /'Ca)A=0, 
which gives 

(2) A = _ZO!l. 

If A is computed by this formula, a + A = a^ will usually be 
closer to the true value of x than was a ; but, in general, a^ 
will still not be the exact value of a:, but only an approxima- 
tion. If now we repeat this process, using a^ instead of a, 
we may compute the quantities 

''' = -/(S' ''2 = ''. + ^.- 

and usually a^ will be a still better approximation to the 
root. In most cases this process of approximation, if repeated 
often enough, will enable us to obtain the value of x with any 
desired degree of accuracy. The process is known as Newton's 
method. 




158 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Arts. 98, 99 

98. Geometric significance of Newton's method. Let A 
(Fig. 45) be the point of the graph of y=if(x) which cor- 
responds to the value of x, 

x = a = OM. 
Ihen 

MA^fCa), 

and the slope of the tangent ^7^ is equal 
to /'(a). (See Art. 87.) Let H be the 
point in which the tangent crosses the 
a:-axis, and let a + 7i be the abscissa of IT. Then the coordi- 
nates of if will be (a -I- A, 0), while those of A are (a, /(Â«))â€¢ 
Therefore (see Art. 53), the slope of J. 2^ will be equal to 

/(Â«)-Q ^ /(Â«), 

a â€” (a + A) /* 

Since the same slope is also equal to /'(a), as we have seen 
above, we must have 

wlience h = â€” â–  



/'(Â«) 



But this is precisely the value of h given by equation (2) of 
Art. 97. Therefore Newton's method of approximation consists 
in replacing the curve ABO by the straight line AT^ which is 
tangent to the curve at the point A whose abscissa is equal to a. 

The approximate value of x obtained by a single applica- 
tion of Newton's method is the abscissa a^ of the point H 
(Fig. 45). A second application of the method would con- 
sist in replacing that part of the curve between A^ and B by 
the tangent at Ay The figure shows how very nearly the 
intersection of this tangent with the aj-axis would coincide 
with B. 

99. The method of false position (Regula falsi). A second 
method of approximation, also suggested by geometry, is as 
follows. If /(a) and/ (6) are opposite in sign, we know that 



Art. 99] THE METHOD OF FALSE POSITION

Fig. 46 



there is at least one root of the equation /(.c) = between 
a and b. In Fig. 46 we have 

a = 031 /(a) = 3IA < 0, 
b=ON, f(h) = NB>0, 

and the root of /(a')=0, which lies be- 
tween a and b, is the abscissa of the point 
R. li A and B are close together, we may 
regard the straight line AB as a reasonably close approxi- 
mation to the curve ABB, and the point S, in which AB 
intersects the 2:-axis, as a fairly good approximation to the 
point R. The abscissa of jS will therefore be an approxima- 
tion to that root of the equation /(a;) = which corresponds 
to tlie point B. We shall now show how to calculate this 
approximate value of the root. 
The slope of the line AB is

INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 100 



The value of x^ given hy (3) is the abscissa of the point S^ 
and will in general furnish a close approximation to the 
desired root if a and b are close enough together. 

By repeating this process, using x^ and 6, or a and a:^, instead 
of a and 6, we may obtain a second approximation, and so on. 

This method may be regarded as the geometrical equiva- 
lent of the following arithmetical argument. If a and b are 
close together, and if x is between a and 5, the change in 
the function /(a;) will be approximately proportional to the 
change in the variable x. Now as x changes from a to a:^, 
f(x) will change from /(a) to f{x^); as x changes from a to 
6, f(x) will change from /(a) to f(h^. Therefore we shall 
have approximately : 



(4) 



f(h)-fia) b-a 



If x^ is approximately a root of the equation f{x) = 0, we 

shall have very nearly /(a-j) = 0. If we substitute /(a;j)= 

in (4), we find 

-fjo-^ ^ x^ â€” a 

which again gives the value (3) when solved for x^ 

One may usually obtain a very 
close approximation by combining 
Newton's method with the method 
of false position. For the true 
value of the root usually lies be- 
r tween the two approximate values 
obtained by these different meth- 
ods. Thus, in Fig. 47, the point 
M lies between the points H and aS'. 

100. An example of Newton's method. We wish to find a 
real root of the equation 

(1) f(x') = x^ + J^-Sx^- x-4 = 0. 

We find /(I) =- 6, /(2) =+ 6. 




Art. 100] AN EXAMPLE OF NEWTON'S METHOD

Consequently (Art. 96, Theorems I and II), there is a real 
root between x = 1 and x = 2. Therefore we put 

a: = 1 4- 2/, or 7/ = 3- â€” 1, 

where ?/ is a positive proper fraction ; ?/ is the correction 
which must be added to 1 so as to make 1 + y a root of (1); 
it is the quantity which was denoted by h in Art. 97. 
According to Art. 92, t/ will be a root of the equation ob- 
tained from (1) by diminishing its roots by 1. We perform 
the calculation by synthetic division :

Thus, the correction y will be a root (between and 1) of

It frequently happens that Newton's method fails to furnish 
a good approximation at the first stage of the calculation 
even if it works satisfactorily at the later stages. It fails 
entirely at the first stage of tliis example because the co- 
efficient of J/ in (3) is equal to zero. But the method of 
false position (Art. 99) may be used to advantage. If we 
use formula (3) of Art. 99, putting a = 1, 6 = 2, we find 

' 6 -(-6) -2 

thus suggesting 1.5 as an approximate value for x, or 0.5 as 
an approximate value for ^.

To locate the root a little more precisely we calculate 
^(0.5) by synthetic division. This gives

We have thus found ^(0.5) = â€” 3.8125. Since we have 

i/CO) =/(l) = - <3, ^(1) =/(2) = + (3, 

the true value of the correction i/ must lie between 0.5 
and 1.0. 

Let us try y = 0.8 next. Sjaithetic division gives

+ 0.8096 



so that ^(0.8) =+ 0.8096. Since ^(0.5) = -3.8125, the 
root of (3) for which we are looking lies between 0.5 and 
0.8. Since the value of ^(0.8) is small, it is apparent that 
the approximation 0.8 for i/ is fairly close and we shall there- 
fore continue our calculation based upon the approximations 
1.8 for a: or 0.8 for y, by putting 

(6) ^ = 0.8 + 2. 

To determine the equation which the correction z must 
satisfy, we must therefore diminish the roots of (3) by 0.8. 
We have already performed a part of this calculation in (5). 
We now complete this transformation.

Thus z is a root of the equation 
(8) h(z) = s4-f 8.2 z3 + 21.84 s2 + 21.248 z+ 0.8096 = 0. 

Newton's method, which consists essentially in neglecting 
z^, z3, s* in the above equation, leads us to regard 

CQ\ 0.8006 

^ ^ 21.248 

as an approximate value of z. It is not safe to assume that 
this value will be correct to more than its first significant 
figure. We therefore use as our approximate value of z, 
suggested by (9), z = â€” 0.04, giving j/ = 0.8 â€” 0.04 = 0.76 
and a; = 1.76 as the approximate value of a root of (1) 
probably correct to the second decimal place. 

We now continue this process so as to get a still closer 
approximation. Since (8) has a root approximately equal 
to â€” 0.04, we put 
(10) z = -0.04 + ^ 

that is, we diminish the roots of (8) by â€” 0.04 (or increase 
them by + 0.04). This gives rise to the following calcu- 
lation:

where only the last figure is uncertain. For it can be shown 
that, if the quotient fia)/f'{a} begins ivitli k zeros when ex- 



164 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 101 

pressed as a decimal fraction, then the best approximation is 
obtained by carrying out the divisioyi to '2 k decimal places. 

Thus we have found 

a; =1.76 + ^ = 1.760302, 

the last figure only being in doubt. 

When the student has become familiar with the process, 
the discussion given in the text of this article may be 
omitted, and the actual calculation to be exhibited will con- 
sist only of the numbers in the schemes (2), (7), (10). 

Since the problem of finding the nth. root of a given num- 
ber a is equivalent to the solution of the equation 

a:" â€” a = 0, 

Newton's method is also applicable to this problem. In fact, 
even in the case of a square root and cube root, the calcu- 
lation by Newton's method is far more convenient than the 
method taught in elementary algebra. 

101. Horner's method.* Horner's method is very similar 
to Newton's method. The principal difference consists in 
the fact that, in Horner's method, negative corrections are 
avoided. In our example in Art. 100 we found 1.8 as an 
approximation to the root and then proceeded to improve our 
knowledge of this root by starting out in our calculations 
with this approximate value. If we had been using Horner's 
method, we should not have used 1.8 as an approximation ; 
for 1.8 is greater than the required root, as is brought out 
by our calculation, since the correction turns out to be 
negative. Consequently by Horner's method, at this stage, 
we should proceed as follows. As soon as we have dis- 
covered that the root is less than 1.8, we try the value 1.7 
for X. We should then find that 1.7 is the correct approxi- 
mation to use for x in tlie application of Horner's method ; 
since the root actually lies between 1.7 and 1.8, the first two 
significant figures of the root are 1.7 and the correction 
to this will be positive. We then proceed as in Newton's 

* W. G. Horner, London Philosophical Transactions, 1819. 



Arts. 102, 103] NEGATIVE ROOTS 165 

method, using 1.7 as our approximate value of x instead of 
the value 1.8 whicli we actually used. 

In this example 1.8 was actually a closer approximation 
to the root than 1.7. Consequently in this case Horner's 
method would not be quite as advantageous as Newton's. 
In general, we may expect to obtain a result, correct to a 
given number of significant figures, more rapidly by New- 
ton's than by Horner's method. F'or Newton's method 
allows us the privilege of using that one of two numbers 
between which the required root is known to lie, whicli is 
the closer approximation. The only advantage of Horner's 
method is that all of the corrections are positive. 

102. Abbreviated calculation. It often happens, especiall}"- 
in problems of applied mathematics, that only a certain num- 
ber of significant places are required. In fact, in most such 
problems, the coefficients of the equation are themselves not 
known with absolute accuracy. Their values depend upon 
certain measurements, and owing to the uncertainties of 
such measurements, their values are only known with an 
accuracy of a certain number of decimal places. The exact 
application of Newton's or Horner's method, however, usu- 
ally introduces decimal places far beyond these. But these 
additional decimal places add nothing to the accuracy of 
the desired result from the practical point of view. Much 
labor may therefore be avoided by not calculating these 
higher decimal places at all. The following is a good prac- 
tical rule. If in a practical problem a root of an equation is 
to be found correct to k decimal places, abbreviate all the num- 
bers ivhich occur in the calculation to k -\- 1 decimal places, and 
abbreviate the final result to k decimal places. 

103. Negative roots. Negative roots may be obtained by 
the same process as positive roots. It is usually preferable, 
however, to first make the transformation of Art. 95, thus 
reducing the problem of computing a negative root of the 
given equation to that of computing a positive root of the 
transformed equation. 



166 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Arts. 104, 105 

104. Computation of more than one real root. After one 
root a of an equation has been determined, the problem of 
computing a second real root (if th^e is a second) may, of 
course, be treated in the same way. It is simpler, however, 
to first divide the left member of the equation hy x â€” a^ and 
to continue the calculation with the equation of lower degree 
obtained in this way. This equation is called the depressed 
equation. Moreover, if Newton's or Horner's method was 
used for calculating the first root, the coefficients of the 
depressed equation have already been determined in the last 
synthetic division, so that everything is prepared for the 
determination of the next real root. 

EXERCISE XLII 

1. Find to two decimal places the root of x^ + ?> x â€” 20 = which

positive root. Prove this statement. 

Hint. Discuss separately the cases : I, when the equation has no 
zero roots; II, when it has zero roots. In case I, observe that/(.r) will 
assume values opposite in sign for x = and for x sufficiently large and 
positive. Then apply Art. 96. 

105. Upper limit for the positive roots of an equation. Let 
us turn our attention once more to the example of Art. 100, 
and more specifically to the last line of the synthetic division 
(5) of that article. The numbers which occur in this line 



Art. 10.-.] IPPEU LTMTT FOR THE POSITIVE ROOTS 1G7 

are all positive, and the last one, + 0.8096, is the value of 
^(7/) for 2/ = 0.8, or of f(x) for x = 1.8. From the method 
of calculation it is evident that any value of x greater than 
1.8 would only serve to* increase the value of f(x^. Conse- 
quently no root of the equation can be as great as 1.8, and 
we may say that 1.8 is an upper limit for positive roots of 
this equation. 

But what was the significance of the numbers in the last 
line of the synthetic division (5) of Art. 100 ? According 
to Art. 86 this synthetic division teaches us that the quotient 
obtained in dividing .r* + a:^ â€” 3 a;^ â€” 2. â€” 4 by a; â€” 1.8 is 
a;3+ 5. 8a'^ + 10.64a; + 8.512, and that the remainder is 
+ 0.8096. 

Putting these two things together, our example suggests 
the following theorem. Let f(x^ be an integral rational 
function, in which the coefficient of the highest poiver of x is 
positive. Let a he a positive number, let Q(jc) be the quotient, 
and let R be the remainder obtained when we divide 
/(a:) by X â€” a. If R is positive and if none of the coefficients 
of Q(^x) are negative, then a is an upper limit for the positive 
roots of the equation f (x) = 0. Tliat is, no positive root of this 
equation can be as great as a. 

The proof is very simple. We have 

f(x~) = Q(x} (x - a) + R. (Art. 85) 

Since R is positive and Q{x} has no negative coefificients 
the right member will be positive for all values of x as 
great as, or greater than, a. That is, no number as great as, 
or greater than, a can be a root of the equation /(.r)= 0. 

Of course the value of R and the coefficients of Q{x^ are 
best obtained by synthetic division. We may therefore re- 
state our theorem in the following form which is especially 
well adapted for practical application. 

If' in the synthetic division of f(x^ by x â€” a, a being positive, 
none of the results in the third line are negative, tJien a is an 
upper limit for the positive roots of the equation f {x^=- 0. 



168 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 106 

In applying this critei'ion it is again presupposed that the highest 
power of X in/(x-) has a positive coefficient. If this coefficient should 
happen to be negative, change the sign of all of the coefficients before 
proceeding farther. 

The knowledge which results in a specific case from this 
statement will save us from wasting time in searching for 
roots of the equation. For we need not test an}'^ values of x 
as large as the upper limit. Thus in our example, if we 
wish to find a second real root of the equation we know that 
it cannot be as large as 1.8. 

For other methods of obtaining upper limits see Dickson's 
Elementary Theory of Equations, page 57. 

Since all questions concerning negative roots may be con- 
verted into questions concerning positive roots of another 
equation, by means of the transformation of Art. 95, we need 
not expressly formulate the corresponding criterion for the 
lower limit of the negative roots of an equation. 

106. Descartes's rule of signs. It is evident that an 
equation 

(1) / (a:) = Ax^ + 5:rÂ«-i + .-. +Lx + M=^ 

can have no positive roots if all of the coefficients have the 
same sign, that is, if there are no variations of sign among 
the coefBcients. For the value of f(x) will obviously be 
positive for all positive values of x if all of its coefficients 
are positive ; it will be negative for all positive values of x 
if all of the coefficients are negative. In neither case can it 
become equal to zero for a positive value of x. 

The question arises whether there may not be a more 
general connection between the number of variations of sign 
among the coefficients, and the number of positive roots. 
That such a relation exists was discovered by Descaktes. 

Let us, as usual, arrange the terms of the equation accord- 
ing to descending powers of the unknown quantity, and let 

(2) A, B, C, i), ... i, M 

be the coefficients of a;", x"~^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ x, 1 in this order. If A 
were negative, we might consider the equivalent equation 



Art. 106] DESCARTES'S RULE OF SIGNS 169 

â€” j(^x)= 0, whose A would then be positive. We may 
therefore assume that A is positive. We now inspect the 
coefficients (*2), beginning with A^ in the order written. If 
they are all positive, we say there is no variation. If, on 
the other hand, we observe k changes of sign among the 
coefficients (2), as we read them in the order written, we 
say that there are k variations. Zero coefficients may be 
omitted in counting variations. 

Descartes's rule says that an equation with k variations has 
at most k positive roots. 

To prove this rule we proceed as follows. Let a:^, x^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ x^ 
be all of the positive roots of the equation /(a:)= U. Then, 
according to the factor theorem (Art. 84), x â€” x^, x â€” x^^ â€¢â€¢â€¢, 
x â€” x^ are factors Q)if{x^. Consequently the division of/(x) 
by {x â€” x^{x â€” Xc,^ â€¢â€¢â€¢ {xâ€”x^) will be exact, and the (quo- 
tient g{x) will be an integral rational function of degree 
n â€”r such that the equation g{x) = has no positive roots. 
The polynomial g{pc) may have some variations or else it 
may have none ; that is a matter about which we profess 
ignorance. We put this ignorance into evidence by letting 
Fo represent the number of variations in ^(:c), it being under- 
stood that Vf;^ may be equal to zero or some positive integer. 

Let us now write down the signs of the coefficients of 
^(a:), as follows : 

(8) g{x) = +â€¢â€¢â€¢ + + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + + â€¢â€¢â€¢ +, 

where the dots indicate any number of terms, whose coeffi- 
cients have the same sign as those between which the}^ are 
placed. As has been stated already, V^ denotes the number 
of variations in g{x). 

We now attempt to determine the number of variations in 
the product (^x â€” x^ )g(^^ where x-^ is a positive number. If we 
perform the multiplication in the usual manner, however, writ- 
ing down only the signs of the various partial products, we find 

(a: - x^)g(x) = 

+ + â€¢â€¢â€¢ 4-- - + +- -+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ + 

- -+ +- -+ +- - 

+ Â± â€¢â€¢â€¢ Â±-Â± â€¢â€¢â€¢ Â± + Â± â€¢â€¢â€¢ Â±-Â± â€¢â€¢â€¢ Â± + Â± â€¢â€¢â€¢ Â±-, 



170 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 106 

where the ambiguous sign Â± indicates those terms of the 
product concerning the sign of whose coefficients we can say- 
nothing definite. Since in any particular case some of these 
ambiguous signs may be replaced by + and others by â€” , it 
is evident that in some cases the product {x â€” x^)g(x} may 
have man?/ more variations than ^(2;). But in all cases this 
product will contain at least one more variation than ^(x). 
For we shall certainly not be overestimating the number of 
variations in the product if we replace all of the ambiguous 
signs of a group by the sign of the term which just precedes the 
group. If we do this the signs of the product are as follows : 

+ +â€¢â€¢â€¢+-- + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + +â€¢â€¢â€¢+-. 

But this arrangement of signs is the same as in g(^x} except- 
ing the last, which gives rise to an extra variation. 

Thus, if Fj denotes the number of variations in the prod- 
uct (x â€” x{)g(^x^, Fj is at least greater by one unit than V^. 
That is Ti^Fo + l- 

Let us now multiply (x â€” x{)g{x') by a: â€” x^, where x^ 
is a second positive root of the original equation /(a;) = 0. 
Let V^ denote the number of variations in the product 
{x â€” x^{xâ€” Xc^^g(x). By the same argument we find 

and therefore V^ ^ Vq + 2. 

Let us proceed in this way until we have multiplied gix) by 
the product of x â€” Xy, x â€” x^^ â€¢" x â€” x^. The complete prod- 
uct is equal to/(a;). If Vr denotes the number of variations 
in /(a;), we have therefore 

or r ^ Vr - To- 

Since Vq may be equal to zero or a positive integer, we 
shall certainly have 
(4) r < Vr. 



Art. 106] DESCARTES'S RULE OF SIGNS 171 

Now the equation f {x) â€” has precisely r positive roots 
and Vr variations. Therefore the inequality (4) states in 
symbols precisely what Descartes's rule states in words, 
namely : 

The number of positive roots of an equation f (a:) = cannot 
exceed the number of variations among the coefficients of the 
equation. 

It slioiild be noted that Descartes's rule does not state that an equation 
has as many positive roots as it has variations. It merely says that the 
equation can have no more positive roots than variations. It may have 
that nuiny positive roots or it may have fewer. Thus, in the simplest 
case when there are no variations, we may say at once tliat there are no 
positive roots. But an equation may have variations and still have no 
positive roots. Thus the quadratic equation 

a;2 _ X + 1 = 

has two variations but no positive root, both of its roots being imaginary 
as may be verified by solving the equation. 

We may state Descartes's rule in a more definite form on 
the basis of the following remarks. The equation g(x) = 
was assumed to have no positive roots. We made Use of this 
assumption tacitly when we wrote down the signs of g(x) in 
(3), by using a group of -|- signs for the last group in (3). 
For, if the last group of signs in (3) had consisted of â€” signs, 
the equation g(x^= would have to possess at least one pos- 
itive root. (See Ex. 8, Exercise XLII.) Since the first and 
last group of signs in gCx) both consist of + signs, g(x) can 
contain only an even number of variations, if it has any vari- 
ations at all. Thus Vq is either equal to zero or an even 
integer. 

Again, when we were estimating the smallest number of 
variations which the product (x â€” x{)g(x) could possibly 
have, we replaced the first group of signs in the product, 
-\- Â±Â± â€¢â€¢â€¢ Â±, which was followed by a â€” sign, by the group 
-I- + -I- ... -(- followed by a â€” sign. Any one of the terms 
of this group except the first might, however, have a negative 
coefficient. But if we change any one or several of the -f- 
signs in the group -h + + â€¢â€¢â€¢ +Â» except the first, which is 



172 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 107 

not doubtful, to â€” , the number of variations in the group 
will change by an even number or not at all, never by 
an odd number. Similarly for each of tlie other groups. 
Consequentl}" the true number of variations of tlie product 
(x â€” x^g(x) can differ from Vq-{- 1 only by an even number. 
If we combine these remarks with our former argument, 
we obtain the following more precise statement of Descartes's 
rule : 

The equation f (2) = has either as maiiy positive roots as 
there are variations among the coefficients off(x)^ or else fewer 
hy an even number. 

Descartes's rule may also be used in discussing negative 
roots. The transformation of Art. 95 enables us at once to 
make the following statement : 

An equation f(x') = has either as many negative roots as 
there are variations among the coefficients of f(^â€” x), or else 
fewer by an even number. 

EXERCISE XLIII 

In the following examples find the niaxiniuni number of positive and 
negative roots by applying Descartes's rule. 

1. a;3 + 5 X - 7 = 0. 

2. x3 + 2 X- + 8 = 0. 

3. x3 + 1 = 0. 

4. x" + 1 = 0. 

5. x" - 1 = 0. 

11. Instead of counting the variations among the coefficients as in Art. 
106 (2) we may count the number of permanences, that is, the number of 
times that the coefficients of /(x) written in the order (2) of Art. 106, 
fail to change sign. A complete equation is an equation of the form 
f(x) = in which no term of /(x) has a zero coefficient. Prove that 
a complete equation has no more negative roots than the number of 
permanences among its coefficients. 

107. Maxima and minima of an integral rational function. 

We have learned how to compute tlie slope of the straight 
line which is tangent to the graph of y =/(2;) at the point

Art. 107] MAXIMA AND MINIMA 173 

(x, y). Tilt' slope of this tangent is equal to the derivative, 
f'(x), of f{x). (See Art. 87.) We have also seen (in 
Art. 53) that a line slopes upward from left to right or 
downward from left to right according as its slope is positive 
or negative. Consequently the course of a curve y =/(a;) 
will he upward from left to right in the neighhorhoo'1 of a point 
whose abscissa makes f {x} positive, and downward from left 
to right near a point for tohichf^pc) is negative. 

Jn other words, the function /(a;) increases with increasing 
X when its derivative /'(.c) is positive; it decreases with in- 
creasing X \\\\enf'(x) is negative. 

A maximum is a point on a curve which has a greater 
ordinate than any other point in its immediate neighbor- 
hood. It is, therefore, a point at which 
the curve changes from an upward to 
a downward course if we think of the 
curve as being described from left to 
right. (See the point marked A in Fig. 
48.) 

Similarly at a minimum (such as ^, 
Fig. 48) the curve changes from a downward to an upward 
course. 

Consequently, if jo is a particular value of x which corre- 
sponds either to a maximum or minimum of the graph of 
y = f(x}, the derivative /'(a;) must change its sign as the 
variable x passes through the value jo. If/ (2;) is an integral 
rational function, /'(a;) is also an integral rational function 
and therefore a continuous function. (See Art. 96.) Con- 
sequently /'(a;) can change sign only by passing through zero. 
We draw the following conclusion : 

The abscissas of the maxima or minima of an integral rational 
function f{x) are included among those values of xivhich make 
the derivative f (x^ equal to zero. 

But not all roots of the ecjuation f'{x) = need to corre- 
spond to maxima or minima of /(a;). In fact the equation 
/'(a;) = really only means that the slope of the tangent is 




174 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 107 

equal to zero, that is, that the tangent at such a point is 
parallel to the a^-axis. And this may take place at a point, 
such as (7, Fig. 48, which is neither a maximum nor a 
minimum. 

In order to distinguish between these cases, we may pro- 
ceed as follows. Suppose that x = p is a root of the equation 
f '(x) = 0, which is obtained by equating to zero the derivative 
oi f(x). Let h be a very small positive number, so that â€”h 
is negative. We examine the signs of f'(pâ€”1i) and 
f\p + ^)Â» ^^^ obtain the following criteria : 

If f'ip-Ji)>^, /'(f) = ^' /'(io + ^)<0, x = p gives a 

maximum of/(:r). 
If/'(^-A)<0, /'(jt>) = 0, /'(^ + /0>0, x=:p gives a 

minimum of /"(a;). 
If /'(^-A)>0, /'(jt>)=0, /'(jt> + 70>0, x = p gives 

neither a maximum nor minimum. 
If/'(^-A)<0, /'(p)=0, /'(;,+ A)<0, x = p gives 

neither a maximum nor minimum. 

The determination of the maxima and minima of a function 
/(a;) is often a matter of great practical importance. Most 
of the proljlems of Engineering are questions of tliis kind, 
since the engineer should attempt to make his constructions 
serve their purpose with a maximum of efficiency for a given 
outlay in money and time. From our present point of view, 
it is evident that a knowledge of the maxima and minima 
of a function is bound to be of great assistance in studying 
its graph.

11. A box open at the top is to be made from a square piece of tin, the 
length of one side of the square being a inches. It is proposed to do this 
by cutting equal squares out of the four corners and then bending up the 
tin so as to form tlie sides of the box. AVhat should be the size of the 
squares cut out of the corners so that the box may have the largest pos- 
sible volume ? 

12. The strength of a beam is approximately proportional to its breadth 
and the square of its depth. What are the dimensions of the strongest 
beam that can be cut out of a circular log whose diameter is d inches? 

108. Rolle's theorem. Let J.ifil/2^3^ (^'igs. 49 and 
50) be the graph of an integral rational function 1/ = fipf)^ 
which crosses the 
rr-axis at the points 
A and B whose ab- 
scissas are equal to a 
and h respectively. 
Then we have 

/(a)=/(i) = 0. 

The figures show that there will be at least one maximum, 
or at least one minimum, between a and h. Since the deriva- 
tive f {x) will be equal to zero at such a maximum or mini- 
mum, these figures suggest the following theorem, which is 
known as Rolle's theorem. 

If an integral ratiowtl funetion f(^x) has the zeros x= a and 
X = by so that f{a~) =/(/>) = 0, then there exists at least one 
value of X, between a and b, for which the derivative f'(x) 
becoynes equal to zero. 

109. Multiple roots. We shall not attempt to give a 
formal proof of Rolle's theorem, but proceed immediately to 
make an important application of it. Let us think of the 






176 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 109 

a:-axis in Fig. 51 as fixed, but let us think of the curve AMB 
as being gradually lowered from its original position, first 
to A'M'B', and then into the third posi- 
tion shown where the curve is tangent to 
the ic-axis at M". During this process 
the three points A, M^ B approach each 
other, and finally all three of these points 
coincide with each other at M" . We see therefore that a 
point of contact, such as M"^ may be regarded as arising 
from the union of two real points of intersection. 

If m" is the abscissa of M'\ the function /(a;), of which the 
lower curve of Fig. 51 is the graph, will of course have 
X â€” m" as a factor, since /(a:) becomes equal to zero for 
X = m". But f(x^ will actually contain {x â€” m")^ as a fac- 
tor, since each of the two factors x â€” a and x â€” b {a and b 
being the abscissas of A and B^ will tend toward x â€” m" as 
the curve AMB is lowered into its final position. We 
express this fact by saying that m" is a double root of the 
equation /(a-) = 0. 

According to Rolle's theorem there is a root of the equa- 
tion f'(x^ = between any two roots of /(.r) = 0. In our 
case tliis root of f (x) = clearly coincides with m" . This 
is also apparent from the fact that the x-axis is tangent to 
the graph at M" . 

The same conclusion follows if m" is a triple, quadruple, 
or multiple root of any degree of multiplicity. Consequently 
we obtain the following theorem: 

Every multiple root of f(x) = i% also a root off'{x) = 0*. 

By the factor theorem then, every multiple factor of ./"(a:) 
will also be a factor of /'(a;). We may therefore decide 
whether a given equation has multiple roots or itot as 
follows: 

We determine the highest common factor of f(^x) and f {x). 
If this highest common factor does not contain x, the equation 

*The converse of this theorem is not true. That is, not every root of /'(.'â€¢) =0 
is a multiple root off{x) = 0, nor indeed necessarily a root oi/{x) = at all. 



Art. no] RATIONAL KOOTS OF AN EQUATION 177 

f(^z) = han no multiple root. If the highest common factor 
does contain a,", the multiple roots of /(a-) = will be those roots 
of the equation ivhich are obtained by equatim/ to zero the highest 
common factor of\f\u) andf'{x^. 

The process of finding the highest common factor of two 
polynomials, such as f(x) and /'(a;), is pi-obably familiar to 
the student from his first course in algebra. It is essentially 
the same as the process for finding the greatest common 
divisor of two integers (see Art. 5) and is justified by the 
same kind of reasoning. 

EXERCISE XLV 

Examine the following eiiuations for multiple roots. Determine the 
multiple roots if there are any ; and use these roots for the purpose of 
finding an equation of lower degree which the remaining simple roots 
will have to satisfy. Solve the etpiations completely.

2. X* - 6 x2 - 8 2 - ;} = 0. 4. x" - x3 + 10 x^ - 8 = 0. 

5. x^ - 15 x8 + 10 x2 + 60 X - 72 = 0. 

6. x5 -3x*- o x3 + 13 x^ + 24 X + 10 = 0. 

7. Show that x^ + 9 x'^ + 2 x â€” 48 = has no multiple root. 

8. Show that x^ + :> ^x + r = has a multiple root if and only if 
4 78 + r- = 0. 

110. Rational roots of an equation with rational coefficients. 
If all of the coefficients of an equation of the form 

(1) Ax"" + Bx"-'^+ â€¢â– ' + Lx + M=0 

are rational numbers, we may at once reduce the equation to 
another one of the same form with integers as coefficients. 
To do this, it suffices to multiply both members of the equa- 
tion by the lowest common denominator of its various frac- 
tional coefficients. Let us assume therefore that all of the 
coefficients of (1) are integers. 

If we divide both members of (1) l>y A we obtain the 
equation 

(2) a:"-f ^rÂ«-M- â€¢â€¢â€¢ +^^ + '^=0, 
^ ^ A A A 



178 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 110 

iu which the coefficient of a;" is equal to unity, but in which 
the remaining coefficients will not, in general, be integers. 
But if we put 

(3) x = ^, 1/ = kx, 

y must satisfy the equation, 

y^ Btr^ ,,.LyM^^ 
k- Ak''~^ Ak A 

or 

(4) y- + !%Â«-! + ... + |f-V+ ^^" = 0, 

and the integer k may always be chosen in such a way that 
this equation for y shall have integral coefficients. (Com- 
pare with Art. 94.) In fact if we put k = A, the coefficients 
of (4) will certainly be integers, but often a value of k 
smaller than A will accomplish the same purpose. 

We have seeii that, by putting 

a; = |, y = kx, 

tvhere k is an integer, we can always transform the given equa- 
tion ivith rational coefficients into another one of the form 

(5) ?/" + 6t/"-i + cÂ«/"-2 H \-ly + m â€” ^ 

which has the folloiving ttvo properties : 

(a") its coefficients are integers ; 

(5) the coefficient of the highest power of the unknown quantity 
is equal to unity. 

If the original equation has a rational root, (5) must also 
have a rational root, since every root of (5) is equal to k 
times a root of (1), and k is an integer. Conversely, to 
every rational root of (5) corresponds a rational root of (1) 
by means of (-3). 

Thus, the problem of finding the rational roots of (1) will be 
solved if we can find the rational roots of (5). 



Art. 110] RATIONAL ROOTS OF AN EQUATION 179 

But the latter may be found with comparative ease, on 
account of the following theorem. 

Jf an equation has the properties (a) and (5), mentioned 
above, any rational roots which it may have must be integers. 

To prove this, let (5) be the given equation, having the 
properties (a) and (/>). If this equation has a rational root, 
let us denote this root by 

(6) y=^P 

9 

where p and q are integers without a common divisor, so 
that the fraction p/q is in its lowest terms. If (6) is a root 
of (5), we must have 

9" \ ^"~ 9" q J 

or E. â€” â€” (bp''-'^ + cp^-^i + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + Ipq""'^ + mq"''^}. 

The right member of this equation is an integer. The left 
member is not an integer unless 5-= Â± 1, in which case the 
root (6) is itself an integer, thus proving our theorem. 

Thus, it only remains to settle the question whether (5) 
has any integral roots. This can be done quite easily on 
account of the following theorem: 

Any integral root of an equation, of the form (5), tvith inte- 
gral coefficients, must be a divisor of the constant term m of the 
equation. 

In fact if an integer y satisfies equation (5), we have 

m = â€” y â€” by'*-^ â€” ly = â€” y{y''~^ -I- ^i/"~^ H f- 

showing that w is a product of two integers one of which is 
equal to y. 

Thus, if we wish to examine the given equation (1) for 
rational roots, we proceed as follows : 

1. If the given equation in x does not have the properties 
(a) and (5), ive transform it into another equation in y which has 



180 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Akt. 110 

these properties hy putting x = y/k^ using the smallest value 
of the integer k which ivill accomplish the purpose. 

2. The resulting equation in y must have integral roots if 
it has any rational roots at all. These integral roots must he 
divisors of its constant term. Therefore, we test each of the 
divisors of the constant term of the equation, to see ivhether it 
is or is not a root of the equatiori in y. 

3. From every integral root of the equation in y which is 
obtained in this way, we find a rational root of the original 
equation in x hy dividing it hy k. 

It may not be necessary to test all of the divisors of m as indicated 
in No. 2. If some of them lie beyond the upper limit for positive roots, 
or below the lower limit for negative roots (see Art. 105), they cannot be 
roots of the equation and need not be tested. Descartes's rule (Art. 106) 
may also frequently be used to reduce the number of trials. Moreover, 
if one rational root has been found, it will usually be advisable to make 
use of it to depress the given equation before proceeding farther. 

EXERCISE XLVI 

Examine the following equations for rational roots. 
1. 108x3 - ,54x2 + 45 a; - 13 = 0. 

Solution. We first write this equation in the form 

(1) x^-\x^+j\x-^^\ = Q. 
If we put X = y/k, // will satisfy the equation 

The smallest value of k which will make the coefficients of this equation 
integers is A; = 6. Therefore we put x = y/6 and obtain the equation 

(2) / - 3 f + 15 y - 26 = 

for y. This equation has properties (a) and (b) ; any i"ational root 
which it may possess must therefore be an integer, and moreover a 
divisor of â€” 26. The only integral values of y that w^e need test there- 
fore are Â±1, Â±2, Â±13, Â± 26, since these are the only integral divisors 
of - 26. 



Art. Ill] SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS REQUIRED 181 

But according to Descartes's rule, (2) has no negative roots. It suffices 
therefore to test + 1, + 2, + lo, + 26. We begin with + 1. Synthetic 
division gives 

1 _ 3 +1.5 - 26 |_1 

1 - 2 4- 13 
- 2 +13 - 13 

Therefore + 1 is not a rout of (2). We test + 2 next. 

1 _ ;j +15 - 2() I +2 

2 - 2 +26 



1-1+13 



Therefore + 2 is a root of (2). The depressed equation 

Z/-- 2/ + 13 = 

is a quadratic whose discriminant is equal to 1 â€” 4 â€¢ 13 = â€” 51, which is 
not a perfect square. Consequently this quadratic has no rational root, 
and therefore 3/ = + 2 is the only rational root of (2). Since x â€” y/Q, 
the only rational root of (1) is x â€” 1/3. 

2. J-3 - 3 x'^ - 2 X + 6 = 0. 6. x< - 6 x8 + 6 x2 + 5 X + 12 = 0. 

3. x3 - 8 x2 + 17 X - 10 = 0. 7. 2 x-Â» - x3 - 5 x2 + 7 X - 6 = 0. 

4. x3 - 9 x2 + 23 X - 15 = 0. 8. x^ + -i/- -i'- - '/ ^ + V = 0. 

5. 3x3 + 8x2 + X - 2 = 0. 9. 12x3 - 13x2 + fx - ^ = 0. 

111. Summary of the operations required in solving an 
equation with given numerical coefficients. The application 
of iSewton's or Horner's method is likely to cause trouble 
when the root to be determined is a multiple root. It is 
advisable, therefore, to apply the method of Art. 109 in order 
to detect and determine any possible multiple roots before 
proceeding farther. It will then be easy to depress the 
equation (Art. 104). dividing by (^x â€” ay if a is a Ar-tuple 
root, by (x â€” by if b is an Staple root, and so on. The 
resulting equation will have only simple roots. If its coeffi- 
cients are rational numbers, it should be tested for rational 
roots (Art. 110). 

Descartes's rule (Art. 106) may then be used to find an 
upper bound for the number of positive and negative roots 



182 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 112 

of this equation. li the left member of the equation be 
called /(a;), we may compute the value of f(x), by sjm- 
thetic division (iVrt. 93), for various values of a;, obtain- 
ing incidentally an upper limit for positive roots (Art. 105), 
a lower limit for negative roots (Art. 105), and some indica- 
tion as to the location of the roots. If we wish, these calcu- 
lations may be used for plotting the graph of y =f{x). As 
soon as we have discovered in this way the approximate 
location of a root, we may determine its position as accu- 
rately as we please by means of Newton's or Horner's method 
(Arts. 100 and 101), or by the method of false position (Art. 
99). 

While we have learned in Art. 109 how to avoid the 
trouble caused by multiple roots, there remains another case 
which requires a word of explanation. If two roots a and h 
are very close together without coinciding absolutely, essen- 
tially the same difficulties appear in applying Newton's or 
Horner's method as in the case of a double root, but we can- 
not use the same method for overcoming these difficulties. 
The methods best adapted for separating the roots in such 
cases are connected with a theorem of Sturm's and cannot 
be discussed here. See Dickson's Elementary Theory of 
Equations^ pag6 96. 

We have said nothing about any methods for calculating 
imaginary roots. Since a complex quantity contains two 
real numbers (its real and imaginary components), the prob- 
lem of calculating a complex root may be regarded as one 
involving two unknowns, and such problems are reserved for 
a later chapter. 

112. Application of cubic equations to floating spheres. All 

calculations about floating bodies are based upon a funda- 
mental law usually called the principle of Archimedes after 
its discoverer. Archimedes (287-212 b.c), who is gen- 
erally regarded as the greatest mathematician of antiquity, 
lived in Syracuse, which was then a prosperous city of Sicily 
inhabited by colonists who had come from Greece. Accord- 
ing to a familiar story, Hiero, king of Syracuse, had given 



Art. n-2] APPLICATION OF CUBIC EQUATIONS 183 

orders to a goldsmith to make a crown for him, and had 
given him the necessary amount of gold carefully weighed. 
When the crown was delivered, its weight was found to be 
correct, but the suspicion arose that the goldsmith had de- 
frauded the king by replacing some of the gold by an equal 
weight of silver. But how was this suspicion to be verified? 
Knowing the great reputation of Archimedes, the king laid 
the case before him, and Archimedes promised to make an 
attempt to solve the problem. A short time afterward, while 
in the public baths of Syracuse, he observed that the water 
seemed to exert an upward pressure upon his body, and that 
this pressure increased or decreased according as more or less 
of his body was immersed. Recognizing the bearing of this 
observation on the problem of Hiero's crown, he rushed 
out into the street shouting, " I have found it, I have found 
it." 

His solution of the problem was as follows. He weighed 
out a quantity of gold and an equal weight of silver, the 
weighing being performed in air as usual. He then attached 
these equal weights of silver and gold to the two ends of a 
bar with equal arms, which would therefore be in complete 
equilibrium. He then placed a vessel filled with water 
underneath the bar, so that both the gold and the silver were 
covered with water. The silver now seemed to weigh less 
than the gold. This being established, the problem of the 
crown could be solved easily. If on a balance the crown was 
measured against an equal weight of gold, and then the 
whole was immersed in water, the gold would outweigh the 
crown if the goldsmith had been dishonest. 

The fundamental principle of Hydrostatics discovered by 
Archimedes may be stated as follows. When a body is 
immersed in water, the water exerts an upward pressure 
upon it which, either partially or completely, counteracts the 
downward tendency due to gravity. 

Consequently a body will loeigh less when immersed in water 
than in air. This loss in weight is exactly equal to the weight 
of the water which the body displaces. 



184 



INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 112 



In the case of a floating boch% the upward pressure of 
the water just balances the downward effect of gravity. 
Therefore : 

The total iveight of a float iny body is ejjual to the weic/ht of 
the water which it displaces. 

Since the weight of a body varies as its mass (see Art. 80) 
we may, if we prefer, also state this law as follows. 

TJie total mass of a floatijig body is equal to the mass of the 
water ivhich it displaces. 

We proceed to make an application of this principle. Fig- 
ure 52 represents the cross section of a sphere of radius r float- 
ing in water and immersed to a depth 
AB = h. The volume of the sphere is 

The volume of the submerged por- 
tion of the sphere is of course equal to 
the volume of the water which has been 
displaced by tlie floating body. If we 




FiU. o2 



call this volume -y', we shall have 

(2) v' =7rA2(>- 1 /O-t 

If we use the centimeter as unit of length and the gram as 
unit of mass, the density of water is equal to unity (see Art. 
44), so that the mass (in grams) of the water displaced will 
be 

(3) m' = 'Kli\r -^h). 

If the sphere is composed of material of density p, the mass 
of the spliere will be 

(4) w = I 'TTT^P- 

* This is the formula for the volume of a sphere of radius /â– . 
t This is the formula for the volume of a spherical segment in terms of the 
altitude h and the radius r of the sphere. 



AiiT. 113] APPLICATION OF CUBIC EQUATIONS 185 

According to the principle of Archimedes, w' must be equal 
to m if tlie sphere floats, that is, 

'rrh^(r â€” J A) = | Trr^p, 

whence ^^(3 r â€” k) = A r^p, 

or 

(5) A3 _ 3 rJfi + 4 rV = 0. 

Since the density p of u substance, when measured in 
terms of grams per cubic centimeter, is tlie same number as 
the specific gravity of that substance (Art. 44), we may state 
our result as follows: 

If a solid sphere of radius r, lohich is composed of material 
whose spenfic gravity is equal to p, floats upon water, the depth 
h to which it will sink into the water is a root of the cubic 
equation (-') ). 

Ill ;>|i|ilyini:;- (.')). it is not necessary to express )â€¢ ami li in centimeters; 
tlit'V may lie expressed in any conveiiieut unit, but of course the same 
unit must he used for both. Tlie reason for this is apparent from the 
equation (5) itself. Every term of (.5) has the dimension L^ since p, the 
specific gravity, is an abstract number. 

113. Application of cubic equations in Trigonometry. 

From the addition formulas 

^ sin (a + /3) = sin a cos (3 -f- cos a sin yS, 

cos (a + /S) = cos Â« cos /3 â€” sin Â« sin /3, 

we obtain the familiar formulas 

(2) sin 2^ = 2 sin 6 cos d, cos 2 (9 = os^ - sin2 

by putting u = /3 = 6. If now we put in (1), a= '2 6. /3 = d 
and make use of (2), we easily find 

sin :5 6 ^ :] s'\n v.os^ 6 - sin3 6, 
cos 3 ^ = cos3 ^ â€” 3 sin^ 6 cos 6. 
Since we have sin^^ + cos^^ = 1, 

we may write instead of (3), 

, sin 3 ^ = 3 sin ^ - 4 sin^ 9, 

^ ^ cos 3 ^ = 4 cos3 ^ - 3 cos 6. 



186 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 113 

If in these equations we regard sin 30 and cos 3 6 as known., the 
values of sin 6 aiid cos 6 may each be obtained by solving a cubic 
equation. 

This fact has an important bearing on the idiiwous problem of the trisec- 
tion of an angle. It can be shown that the solution of this problem is 
equivalent to that of finding a construction for the sine of one third of 
the given angle. It can further be shown that the cubic equation (4) 
cannot be solved by expressions involving only square roots. Finally it 
can be shown that a construction in the sense of elementary geometry, 
which only makes use of the ruler and compasses as instruments, can only 
be performed when the corresponding problem formulated algebraically 
is solvable by expressions involving only square roots. Consequently the 
problem of trisecting an angle of any size bij a ruler and compass construction 
is insolvable. This does not mean that an angle can not be trisected. It 
merely means that it cannot be trisected with the help of ruler and com- 
passes alone. 

The same remark applies to the problem of the dup>Ucation of the cube, 
the so-called Delian problem.*

CHAPTER V 

INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF THE nth ORDER. 
THE PROBLEM OF THE ALGEBRAIC DETERMINATION 
OF THEIR ZEROS. AND THEIR GENERAL PROPERTIES 

114. Distinction between the algebraic and numerical solu- 
tion of an equation. We have shown how the real roots of an 
equation of the form 

(1) Ax" + Bx''-'^ + 'â– â–  +Lx + M=0 

may be determined, if the coefficients A, B, â€¢' L, Mare given 
numbers. But our solution of the problem was arithmetical 
rather than algebraic, since we did not find a general formula 
for the value of the roots of (1) in terms of the coefficients. 
In two cases, however, namely, when the given equation is of 
the first or second degree, we did find such general formulas. 
Thus we have actually accomplished the algebraic solution 
of equations of the first and second degree. (See Chapters 
II and III.) We shall now show that there are some other 
cases in which we are able to solve an equation algebraically . 

115. The equation a:Â«-1 = 0. If ^ = 1, B=C= â€¢â€¢ =X = 0, 
iHf = â€” 1, equation (1) of Art. 114 reduces to 

(1) a;" - 1 = or x" = 1. 

If n is an odd integer, the only real number which satisfies 
this equation is a;= 1. If n is even, the equation has two 
real roots, namel}^ x = + 1 and x = â€”\. 

The question now arises whether (1) may not also have 
some complex roots. This question may also be formulated 
thus. Can the wth power of a complex number be equal to 
unity ? 

187 



188 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 11(3 

116. The TJth power of a complex number. In order to 
settle this question, we iimst first learn how to determine the 
nth power of a given complex number. The easiest way to 
accomplish this is to make use of the geometric representa- 
tion of a complex number as a vector, which was explained 
in Art. 24, and the definition of multiplication of two com- 
])lex numbers as given in Theorem I, of Art. 31. Let r^ and 
r^ be the moduli of two complex numbers, and let 6^ and 6^ 
he their amplitudes. Then, according to the theorem just 
quoted, the product will be a complex quantity whose modu- 
lus is equal to r^r^ and whose amplitude is equal to ^1 + ^2- 

If rj and r^ are both equal to r, and 6-^ and 6^ are both equal 
to 6, the product will be the square of that complex number 
which has r as its modulus and 6 as its amplitude. There- 
fore the square of this complex number will have r â€¢ r = r^ 
for its modulus and 0-^6=20 as its amplitude. In the 
same way w^e see that the cube of the given complex number 
will have r^ for its modulus and 3 6 for its amplitude. In 
general, we obtain the following result. 

Jfr is the modulus and 6 the amplitude of the complex num- 
ber a + bi, the nth power of a + bi will have r" for its modulus 
and nd for its amplitude. 

The same result may be obtained by using the polar form of the com- 
plex number (Art. 30). If we write 

(1) X = a + hi = r(cos + i sin 6), 

we find first 

x^ = X- x = r- r[cos(^ + 6)+ /sin(^ + 6)}, (Equation (:3), Art. 31) 
or 

(2) x2 = r2 (cos 20 + 1 sin 2 6) . 

Again we have 

x^^ x-^x= r- â–  r [cos(L> $ + 0) + i sin(2 6 + 6)], 
or 

(3) .r8 = r3(cos :i6 + i sin 3 6) ; 

and continuing in this way, we finally obtain the formula 

(4) x" = r"(cosn^ + i sin nd).

117. The complex roots of unity. We are now prepared to 
answer the question raised in Art. 115, whether the wth root 
of a complex number may be equal to unity. In Fig. 53, the 
vector (9^j,one unit long in the direction of the positive aj-axis, 
represents tlie complex number 1=. 1 + â–  i. Let us draw a 
circle of unit radius with as center, so that A-^ will be upon 
its circumference. Let us divide the circumference into n 
equal part.s, Aj^ being one of the points of division, and the 
others being denoted by A^, A^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ -4â€ž. (Li Fig. 53, we have 
chosen n = 8.) Then, each of the n vectors OA^ OA^. ^-^z' "' 
OAn represents a complex number ivhose nth 
power is equal to unity. 

PiiOfJF. Consider OA^ It represents 
the complex (piantity who.se modulus is 1 
and whose amplitude is 0Â°. According 
to Art. 31, the nth power of this complex 
quantity Mill have as its modulus 1" = 1 
and its amplitude w x 0Â° = 0Â°. Therefore 
the nth power of this complex quantity is 0(|ual to unity, as 
is also evident by calculation. 

Consider OA,^., which represents a complex quantity whose 
modulus is 1, and whose amplitude is 360'^//Â«. (In the figure 
this angle is equal to 45Â°.) According to Art. 31, the nth 




190 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 117 

power of this complex quantity will have as its modulus 
1" = 1, and the value of its amplitude will be w(360Â°/w) = 360Â°. 
Therefore the nth power of the complex quantity represented 
by OA2 is the complex quantity represented by OA^ which 
is 1 + .^â–  = 1. 

In the same way we can show that each of the n vectors 
mentioned represents a complex quantity whose nth power is 
equal to unity. 

It is easy to shotv further that the n complex quantities repre- 
sented by OA-^, OA^, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ OAn are the only ones whose nth powers 
are equal to unity. 

For, if r is the modulus and 6 the amplitude of a complex 
quantity whose nth power is equal to 1 + â€¢ z, r" must be equal 
to the modulus of 1 + â€¢ z, and n9 may differ from the ampli- 
tude of 1 + â–  i only by an integral multiple of 360Â°. 
(See Art. 25, last statement.) Consequently we must have 

(1) r" = 1, nO = A" â€¢ 360Â°, 

where k may be zero or any positive or negative integer. 
Now r is the modulus of a complex number and is therefore 
positive, by definition. (See Art. 23.) Since r is positive, 
and since the onl}' positive number, whose nth power is equal 
to unity, is unity itself, we find from (1) 

(2) r=l, ^ = ^^^, /t = 0, Â±1, Â±2, Â±3, .... 

n 

If in these equations we put in succession ^ = 0, 1, 2, 
â€¢ " n â€” 1, we obtain precisely the n vectors OA^, OA^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ OA^ 
of Fig. 53. If we give any other integral value to k, for 
instance a positive value greater than n â€” 1 or a negative 
value, we only obtain one of these same vectors over 
again. 

A number, real or complex, whose nth power is equal to 
unity is called an nth root of unity. We have shown that 
there exist exactly n distinct nth roots of unity. Tliey are the 
n complex 'numbers which are represented by the n vectors OA^,

We may write out the value of each of these nth roots of unity in its 
polar form at once. A complex number of modulus /â€¢ and amplitude $ 
may be written in the form

in (3), may be expressed as follows :

118. Numerical expressions for the complex roots of unity 
for n = 2, 3, 4. It is evident that the two square roots of 
unity are + 1 and â€” 1. In order to obtain expressions for 
the cube roots of unity, consider Fig. 54, 
where the vectors OA^, OA^, and OA^ 
represent these cube roots. Since the 
angle between OA^ and 0^12 is 120Â°, OB 
the bisector of this angle will make an 
angle of 60Â° with OAo and the triangle 
OA^B, isosceles by construction, will have 
to be equiangular and therefore equilat- 
eral. Moreover, each of its sides is of unit length. Con- 
sequently the length of A^C is equal to -|, and that of OC is 
equal to Vl -QY = V| = 1 V3. Since A^ is to the left of 
the y-axis, its abscissa is negative. Therefore the coordi- 
nates of A^ are a: = - .}, y = -h ^V3. If a vector is in its 




Fig. 54 



f 

192 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 118 

standard position (see Art. 2-3) and the coordinates of 
its terminus are (a:, ?/), the vector represents the complex 
number x-{-yi. Consequently the complex number repre- 
sented by OA^ is i i â€¢ /- 

Similarly we find that OA^ represents the complex number 

-I- I iV8. 
Therefore, the three cube roots of unity are 

(1) 1' - i + i ^V8, -l-\ ^ V3. 

A figure may be constructed very easily to represent the 
four fourth roots of unity. Inspection of such a figure shows 
that the four fourth roots of unity are 

(2) 1, i - 1, - L 

These same results may also be obtained without any use 
of geometr}'. The cube roots of unity are those numbers 
which satisfy the equation 

(3) x^=l or x^ -1 = 0. 

This equation obviously has the root x = 1. Therefore 
.c â€” 1 is a factor of x^ â€” 1 and, in fact, we find 

.i-3_ 1 =(.f- l}{x^+ J+1). 

Thus the other roots of the equation (3), that is, those 
which are different from 1, must satisfy the quadratic equa- 
tion â€ž -, 

If we solve this quadratic, we find precisely the second and 
third of the expressions (1). 

Similarly the fourth roots of unity are the roots of the 
eti nation 

x^ = 1 or 2-4 â€” 1 = 0, 

which may be factored into 

(x^ - 1 )(.r2 +l^==(x-l)(x+ l)(x + 0(.r - i) = 0, 

showing that its four roots are precisely the four complex 
numbers (2).

119. Construction of regular polygons. Our discussion of the equation 
.," - 1 â€” suffices to show how very closely its solution is connected 
with the problem of dividing the circumference of a circle into n equal 
parts or, what amounts to the same thing, with the problem of construct- 
ing a regular Â«-gon. On account of this connection the equations of the 
form x" â€” 1 = are frequently called cyclotomic equations. 



194 INTEGRAL RATIOXAL FUNCTIONS [Akt. 120 

It is a familiar fact of elementary geometry that it is possible to con- 
struct a regular polygon of 71 sides with the help of ruler and compasses 
if M is a power of 2, if n is equal to 3 or 5, or if n is a product of any 
two or three numbers of this kind. All of this was known to the 
ancients and was recorded by Euclid. No further progress in this 
direction was made for two thousand years, until Gauss in the early 
part of the nineteenth century proved that regular polygons of 17, 257, 
or 65,537 sides may also be constructed with ruler and compasses. 
More specifically the substance of Gauss's theorem is as follows : If n is 
a number which can be expressed as a product of any power of 2 and one or 
several other distinct factors, each (f which is a prime number of the form 

(1) 22* + 1, 

then and only then will it he possible to construct a regular polygon of n sides 
loith the help of ruler and compasses. 

The numbers of the form (1) which are obtained by putting h = 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4 are in order 3, 5, 17, 257, 65,537 and all of these are actually 
prime numbers. The numbers (1) which correspond to h = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
are known not to be primes. 

For a proof of the above theorem consult the articles quoted in the 
footnote on page 186. 

120. The equation jr" â€” a = 0. If a is a positive number, 
this equation has one positive root which is usually denoted by 

(1) Xq = </a. 

Let x-^ be any other solution of the equation. Then we shall 

have 

a^i" = a, Xq^ = a, 

whence by division 

^ = ^orf^] =1. 



^0 ^ ^^0 

Therefore, if we denote the ratio of x^/xq by y, we see that y 
must be a root of the equation 

(2) r = 1 

and that x^ = X(^. 

But we have just learned that (2) has n distinct solutions, 
only one of which is equal to unity. (See Art. 117.) 

Thus, if a is a positive number, the equation x" â€” a= has 
one positive solution, Xq= -y/a, and nâ€” 1 other solutions, each of 



Art. 120] THE EQUATION rÂ« - a = 195 

which may he obtained from the positive solution by multiplica- 
tion with one of the nth roots of unity. 

Thus the equation x" â€” a = has n roots. If a is positive 
and if n is odd, only one of these roots is real ; if w is even, 
two of the n roots are real, one being positive and one nega- 
tive. The moduli of all of the roots are equal to each other 
(each equal to -y/a) ; only their amplitudes differ. If we 
represent the w roots of this equation geometrically as in 
Art. 117, we find exactly the same results as for the equation 
a:" â€” 1 = 0, with this one exception ; the end-points A^, A,^^ 
â€¢ â€¢â€¢ An of the n vectors which represent the n roots are on 
the circumference of a circle of radius ^a instead of being 
on a circle of radius unity. 

If the quantity a is not positive, nothing very essential is 
changed in our argument, except that in this case there will 
usually not be even a single real root. To be quite general, 
let a be any complex number, and let p be its modulus and 
a its amplitude. On the other hand, let r be the modulus 
and 6 the amplitude of the unknown complex number a-, for 
which 

(3) a;" = a. 

The modulus and amplitude of a:" will be r" and n6 respec- 
tively. (See Art. 116.) Consequently, according to the 
last statement of Art. 25, the equation (3) will be possible 
only if 

r"(the modulus of a;") is equal to p (tlie modulus of a) 
nd (the amplitude of a:") differs from a (the amplitude of a) 
at most by an integral multiple of 360Â° ; that is, if and only 

if 

r- = p, ne = a + k- 360Â°, /r = 0, Â±1, Â±2, Â± 3, ... , 

whence follows 

r = ^/p, ^ = Â«-t-yfc'^â€” , /t = 0, Â±1, Â±2,..., 
n n 

since r and p are both positive numbers (see definition of 
modulus of a complex number in Art. 23). As in Art. 117 



196 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 120 

all of the distinct values of 6 are obtained if we allow k to 
assume the values 0, 1, 2, â€¢â€¢â€¢ nâ€” 1. 

We have the following final result. If a is a complex 
number whose modulus is equal to p and whose amplitude is 
equal to a, the equation a:" â€” a = has n distinct roots. All of 
these roots have the same modulus., namely V/o, and the ampli- 
tudes of the roots are

(4) , ~H ,-+2 ,...,-+(^1-1)- â€” - 

n n n n n n n 

respectively. 

If we plot these n roots as vectors in their standard posi- 
tion, the termini of these vectors will again be the vertices 
of a regular n-gon, inscribed in a circle of radius V/a with 
the origin as center. But in general this inscribed polygon 
will have none of its vertices on the a:- axis, as is shown by 
the values (4) of the amplitudes of the 7i vectors. 

The n roots of equation (â– )) may be written as follows, if we make 
use of the polar form of a complex number.

121. The cubic equation. The general cubic equation 

(1) Ar"^ + Bx^ + Cx+ I)=Q 

may always be reduced to the form 

( -1) j^ + ha^ + ex + d = 

by dividing by A. But equation (2) may be reduced 
further by a simple transformation. Let us put in (2) 

X ^= y + k or y = x â€” k, 

where k, as yet uid-cnown, is to be chosen in such a way as to 
simplify the resulting cubic equation in y. We have 

x= y + k^ 
a^= y^ + 2 ky + k\ 
3^ = y-i + 8 ky'^ + :'> ^V + ^3. 

If we substitute these values of x^, x\ and x in (2), and ar- 
range the result according to descending powers of y. we find 

(3) y^ + (Bk + b)y'-+Qlk^+-2kb + c-)y + k^ + hk^ + ek + d = 0. 

We may now choose k in such a way as to make the coeffi- 
cient of y^ in (3) disappear, namely, by putting 

(4) k = -lb. 

U we substitute this value of k in ( o), this equation assumes 
the form 

(5) y^ + P^ + '1 = 0, 
where 

( f) ) p = c - y)^ anil q = d â€” lhc+ .^^ h^. 

Thus, any cubic equation (2) may be reduced to the form (5) 
by making the transformation^ 

(7) â€¢'^ = ^ - i f>. 

in other words (see Art. 02), by increasing the roots of (2) 
by ^b. Equation (5) is usually spoken of as the cubic in 
its reduced form, or as the reduced cubic. 



198 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 121 

The reduced cubic equation (5) may be solved as follows: 
We may introduce two unknowns, u and w, such that their 
sum shall be a root of the cubic equation ; that is, we put 

(8) y = u+ y, 
whence 

7/3 = ^3 j^ 3 ^^2^, _j_ 3 ^^2 _|_ y3 â€” yZ j^ ^,3 ^ 2) Uv(u + w). 

Since ^ = m + y is to be a solution of (5) we must have 

^3 j^ y3 _|_ 3 uiiQu _|_ 11^ -^ .pQn, -)_ ;) j +(2=0, 

or 

(9) V? + v^+ (3 uv +p')(u + v) = â€” q. 

Any two numbers, u and v, which satisfy this equation 
will have for their sum, w + v, a root of the cubic equation 
(5). And conversely, if we wish u + v to be a root of (5), 
then u and v must satisfy (9). But, since two unknowns, 
such as u and y, are not determined uniquely by means of a 
single equation, we have the right to impose the condition 
that u and v shall satisfy some other equation, besides satis- 
fying (9). This second equation ma}^ be chosen at our 
pleasure, provided it does not contradict (9). The infinitely 
many different choices which we can make of this second 
equation correspond to the infinitely many ways in which a 
given sum y may be split up into a sum of two terms u + v. 

In choosing a second equation for u and y, we are guided, 
of course, by the desire to make this second equation as 
simple as possible, and to have it aid us in simplifying our 
first equation, that is (9), at the same time. This is accom- 
plished by choosing 

(10) ?>uv+p = 

as the second equation. As a consequence of (10), equation 

(9) reduces to 

u^ -{â€¢ v^ =â€” q. 

We have obtained the following preliminary result. Ifu 
and V are two numbers which satisfy the two equations 



Aim. \-2\] THE CUBIC EQUATION 199 

(11) ?f" -f v^ = â€” <i and 3 uv = â€” 2)i 

then their sum, u + >' = y, will he x root of the cubic equation (5). 

Let us solve the second equation of (11) for v., and sub- 
stitute the resulting value in the first. We find 

27 n^ ^ 

or 

(12) U^-\-qu^- .,\p^ = 0. 

But this is a quadratic equation for u^ and may be solved 
for u'^ by the formulae (5) of Art. 68. 
We find in this way 

(13) ,,3 =-iqÂ± V:K, where R = J. P^ + I f- 

Let us choose the upper sign in (13) and let us denote by

â€” \ q + ^R is real. The other two cube roots of â€”\ q+VR 
will then be 

(15) i/g = (w?<p )i^ = (o'^Ui 

where co and co^ are the two complex cube roots of unity, 
namely 

(16) a, = _ I + 1 /V3, 6)2 = _ .1 - 1 ?V3. (See Art. 118.) 

From (11) we find, corresponding to each of these three 
values of u, a value of i\ such that the sum u + v will be a 
root of (5). In particular we find, from the second equation 
of (11), 

But this expression may be simplified by multiplying both 
numerator and denominator by v â€” ^ 9' â€” y/R. We obtain 
in this way, making use of the value of R given in (13),

Art. 1-21] THE CUBIC EQUATION 201 

The three formulas (18), (19), and (-0), for the roots of 
the reduced cubic equation (5), are usually known as 
Cardan's formulas. They were first published in printed 
form by Cakdano (1501-1576) in his famous treatise called 
Ars Magna^ in 1545. Cardano however was not the dis- 
coverer of these formulas. They were first found by 
SciPiONE DEL Fekko, professor of mathematics at Bologna 
from 1496-1526, and perhaps independently by Tartaglia 
(1500-1557). Cardano lias been severely condemned for 
publishing these formulas, which were obtained by him from 
Tartaglia, only after he had sworn to keep them secret. 
It seems, however, that there were circumstances, brought to 
light only recently, which tend to free Cardano from tlie 
odium of perjury. 

Remark. In developing our fornu\las we cliose the nj)pÂ«M- sign in (l-i). 
We niiglit just as well have choseu the lower sign. It is now clear that 
nothing essential would have been changed if we had made this. other 
choice. The result would have been a mere change in notation. The 
quantities which we have actually denoted by u's and y's would instead 
have been denoted by f's and u's respectively. 

EXERCISE LI 
1. Solve the cubic equation x^ â€” 6 x- + 6 x â€” 2 = 0. 
Solution. This equation has the form of (2). Art. 121, and we have 

(1) h =-6, c =^ + t}, d = - 2. 

According to (.")), (6), and (7), Art. 121, the reduced cubic will be 

(2) //=' + p;/ +7 =

(8) />= + Â«- i(-(j)^==-0. >, = -2- i(-(!)6 + v^:(- (;)Â«=- 6. 

r = // + 2. 

From these values and (lo), Art. 121, we find 

(I) /,'= ,V(-(;)M- ](-fir= 1. 

The Cardano formulas (18), (Kl). (20) of Art. 121 now give us 

(o) (/j = >/T + v'2, I/., = (1) v4 + (o'-y/2, //g = a>'v^4 + <dV2. 

According to (:5), tlie corresponding roots of the original equation 
are just 2 greater than these, so that they are

Verify these results by direct substitution, and wiite out the last two 
roots in more detail by substituting the values of to and aS^ from (16), 
Art. 121. 

Solve the following cubic equations and check your results by 
substitution.

3. x3 - 9 X - 28 = 0. 5. a;3 + 4 X- + 4 X + 3 = 0. 

122. Discussion of the roots. If p and q are real numbers 
and 

(1) ii=^hp' + \q' 

is positive, the root 

Vi = "i + Â«'i 

is real, and clearly the other two roots, y^ and y^ are conju- 
gate complex quantities. 

If R is negative, all three roots, as given by the Cardano 
formulas, seem to involve imaginary quantities. One can 
show however that, in this case, the imaginary terms destroy 
each other and that all three roots will be real. A full dis- 
cussion of this case, which we shall omit here, leads to a 
very convenient solution of the cubic equation by means of 
the trigonometric functions. (See Dickson's Elementary 
Theory of Equations, P'^ge 36.) 

The solution of the cubic equation by means of Cardano's 
formulas is a matter of great importance from a theoretical 
point of view. For purposes of actual calculation, however, 
tlie methods of Chapter IV are usually much to be preferred. 

123. The ratios of the coefficients of the general cubic 
equation expressed in terms of its roots. The general cubic 
equation 

Ax^ -{â–  Bx^ -\- Cx ->r D = ^ 

may be written in the form 

(1) a;3 4-^:r2 + -^.r+^=0. 

AAA 

If 2:j, x^-, Xq are the roots of this equation, x â€” x^, x â€” x^i 
and X â€” x^ must be factors of the cubic function which con- 



Aim. 128] COEFFICIENTS IN TERMS OF ROOTS 203 

stitutes the left member of (1). Consequently this left 
member is divisible, without remainder, by the product 
(a; â€” a-j) (a; â€” oTg) (a: â€” 3-3) . Since this product is itself a 
cubic function of a;, the quotient must be independent of a;, 
that is, the quotient must be a constant. Moreover, since 
the coefficient of a-^ in (1) is equal to unity, and the coeffi- 
cient of 2^ in the expanded product (a; â€” t^^{x â€” X2)(x â€” 3^3) 
is also equal to unity, the constant quotient just mentioned 
must be equal to 1. Therefore we must have, for all values 
of X, 

.^3 + _a:2 + ^a: + ^ = (x - x^)(ix - x,;^)(x - a-g) 

But if two such functions are equal to each other for all 
values of a:, the coefficients of like powers of x in the two 
members must be equal (See Art. 126, Theorem F), that is, 

_ = - (a'l + :r3 + .rg),

Formulas (2) sJio^v how to calculate the ratios of the coeffi- 
cients of a cubic equation whose three roots a-^, a-g, x^ are given. 
The coefficients of one such cubic equation are found by 
putting A equal to 'unity. Formulas (2) were apparently 
first noticed by Cardano in 1545. 

We found, in Art. 68, similar relations between the coeffi- 
cients and roots of a quadratic, and we shall see before long 
how these relations may be generalized so as to apply to an 
equation of the n\\\ order. 

This generalization was accomplished by the great French mathe- 
matician ViETE, usually known as Vikta (1540-1608), in 1559, but only 
for the case of positive roots. The Dutch matlieniatician Girard 
(159(X?-1632) finally dropped this unnecessary restriction in 1G29.

124. The equation of the fourth order. We niiiy write any 
(â– (luatiou of the fourth order in the form 

(1 ) .T* + Aj^ + B.r' + Cx + i> = 0, 

and, by means of a transformation, analogous to (7) of 
Art. 121, namely 

(2) x=i/-\A, 

reduce it to an equation of the simpler form 

(3) f + qf + ri/ + s = 0, 

in which there is no term involving i/^. 

We shall attempt to solve (o) by a method similar to that 
which was used in solving the cubic. We shall put 

(4) ^ = u + V + u\ 

thus equating ?/ to a sum of three terms (as yet unknown), 
whereas in the case of the cubic we equated y to a sum of 
two terms. 

We find from (4) 

y^ = li? + ?'2 -f- ^2 _j_ 0(inv + WU + ?/t') 

t/4 = ( M^ + ?'2 ^_ w'2 )2+ 4( ?(2 4- ,.2 + >r^)(V7V + WU + M?'.) 
+ 4( r2w2 4- Â«,2i^2 _^ ^j2,,2) 4. X uf.a,(u + c + w). 

The expression (4) will be a root of (3) if and only if tlie 
following equation, obtained by substituting these values in 
(3), is satisfied : 

( ^2 ^ ,,2 + ,^,2^2^ 4( ,^,2,^^,2 + ^^,2^f2 ^ ,,2^,2 ) ^ ,^( ,/2 + ,.2 + ^^,2) ^ g 

(5) + ( ?'?^ + WU + ur)[4{ 11^ + /'2 + w') + i' '/] 
+ (Â«+?' + /r)( S /^/vr + r) = 0. 

Now we may satisfy this equation, by a proper choice of 
M, i\ and w, in infinitely many ways. The simplest way con- 
sists in making the last two lines of (5) disappear, by im- 
posing tlie two conditions 

, ,,. ?<2 _|_ ^,2 _|_ ^^,2 __ _ 1 q^

on the three numbers u, v, and w, and tlieu as a third condi- 
tion, the equation to which (5) reduces as a consequence of 
(6), namely 

(7) ( U2 + y2 _,_ ^^2)2 ^ ^(^ ^,2^2 + ^^,2,4^2 ^ ^^2^,2 ) 

+ ^(u2 + v2 + ?/.2 ) 4. .s- = 0. 

But this hitter equation may be siniplitied further, on 
account of (6), to 

lq2^ 4(v2ufi + w^'X^ + 7/2,-2 ) _ 1 ,y2 ^ ., ^ 0, 

or 

(8) vhv^ + whj? + uh^ = Jg (f/ - 4 s> 

Thus the sum

satisfy the three equations

whose right members are knoivn in terms of the coefficients of (8). 
If we replace the second equation of (9) by 

(10) u^v^U^= 6 T **^' 

and make use of Art. 123, we see that we can now write 
down a cubic equation of which w2, v"^, and tv"^ shall be the 
three roots. In fact the cubic equation, 

(0 - ?/2)(2 _ v2-)(2; - w2) =

in which 2; is the unknown quantity, lias u^, iÂ»2, w^ as its roots. 
But, on account of (9), we may write this equation as 
follows : 

(11) ^3 + 1 qz^ + Jg (ry2 _ 4 s)z - ,\ r^ = 0, 

the coefficients of this cubic being known in terms of the 
coefficients of the given equation (3). 



206 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 124 

Let 2p 22, ^3 be the roots of this cubic equation. Then we 
may put 

and therefore 

(12) u = Â± Vgj, V = Â± V22, 2i' = Â± V23. 

But not all of the eight possible combinations of the ambigu- 
ous signs Â± are permissible, since we are seeking three num- 
bers w, y, w, which satisfy the relations (9). The first and 
third of these relations will be satisfied if either sign be given 
to each of the square roots which occur in (12). However, 
the second relation of (9), namely 

uinv = â€” |- )\ 

may be used to determine the sign of w after the signs of u 
and V have been chosen arbitrarily. 

If the symbols V^^, 'y/z^, V^g represent square roots of 
2p ^2' % including a + or â€” sign, the signs being chosen in 
such a way as to make 

then the four roots of the quartic equation (3) will be 

^^=V2j+V22+V^, 

2/4 = - ^'^1 - ^^H + ^H- 

The cubic equation (11), which, according to our method, 
must be solved first in order to obtain the roots of the quartic 
equation (3), is called the resolvent cubic. Although there 
are many other methods for solving a quartic equation, they 
all have this feature in common, that a certain cubic equation 
must be solved first before the solution of the quartic can be 
effected. In like manner we saw in Art. 121 that the solu- 
tion of a cubic requires as a preliminary the solution of a 
certain quadratic, namely the quadratic (12) of Art. 121, for 



Art. 125] EQUATIONS OF HIGHER ORDER 207 

u^. This fact manifested itself in the Cardano formulas by 
the appearance of the square root VJL 

Since the quantities z^, z^, z^ are roots of the cubic equa- 
tion (11), we could express their values in terms of q, r, and 
s, by means of the Cardano formulas and thus obtain hnally 
the expressions for the four roots ^]Â«//2'//3' ^i "^ C'"^) ^^ terms 
of its coefficients i-y, r, and s, thus completing;- the algebraic 
solution of the quartic equation. It is clear, however, that 
the resulting expressions will be very complicated and not 
at all adapted to the purposes of actual calculation.* 

We have shown, however, that the roots of ani/ equation of 
the firsts second, third, or fourth degree may he expressed in 
terms of the coefficients of the equation, hy means of formulas 
which involve only a finite number of such ojyerations as addi- 
tion, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of 
square and cube roots. 

The first solution of the quartic equation was given by 
Ferrari (1522-1565), a student of Cardano's, It was 
published in 15-15 by Cardano in his Ars Magna. The 
solution which we have given is essentially the same as the 
one found by Euler (1707-1783) in 1732. 

EXERCISE Lll 

Solve the following equations by the methods of this article :

125. The equations of higher order. Having found an 
algebraic solution for the general equations of order 1, 2, 3, 
and 4, the mathematicians of the sixteenth, seventeenth, 
and eighteenth centuries turned their attention to the gen- 
eral equation of the lifth order. But all attempts to find a 
similar solution for the general equation of the fifth order 
failed. In 1821, the great Norwegian genius Niels Hexruv 
Abel (1802-1829) showed that these efforts were necessarily 
doomed to failure, by proving that it is impossible to express 

* For purposes of numerical calculation, the methods of Chapter IV are, in 
most cases, much to be preferred. 



208 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 126 

the roots of a general quiutic equation in terms of its coeffi- 
cients by means of a finite number of such operations as addi- 
tion, subtraction, multiplication, division, and extraction of 
roots. Abel's proof was long and complicated. By starting 
from an entirely different point of view, Evariste Galois 
(1811-1882) introduced new methods and new ideas, which 
not only enabled him and his successors to materially sim- 
plify the proof of Abel's theorem, but which are of funda- 
mental importance in the theory of equations of higher de- 
gree. These ideas of Galois, leading to what is now known 
as tlie Theory of Groups, had however to some extent been 
anticipated by his great compatriots Lagrange (1736-1813) 
and Cauchy (1789-1857). It is fairly evident that if the 
equation of the fifth degree cannot be solved by means of 
the operations indicated above, then the same thing will be 
true of equations of still higher degree. 

It should be remembered, however, that this impossibility 
of which we are speaking is a relative one. If certain oper- 
ations of a higher character are introduced, besides the mere 
extraction of roots, the equation of the fifth degree can be 
solved. Thus Hermite, who was born in Paris in 1822 and 
died in 1901, showed that the quintic equation could be solved 
by means of elliptic functions. 

126. The fundamental theorem of algebra. We saw in Art. 
55 that an equation of the first degree always has one solution. 
Admitting complex numbers as solutions of an equation, we 
proved in Art. 70 that every quadratic equation with real or 
complex coefficients has two roots, real or complex, distinct 
or coincident. The case of coincident roots is understood 
more easily if we express this theorem in a different form 
whicli, on account of the factor theorem (Art. 81), is equiv- 
alent to it; namely, every quadratic function Ax^ + Bx-\- 
may be expressed as a product of two linear functions, with 
real or complex coefficients. The case of coincident roots 
corresponds to the case where these two linear factors are 
identical. 



Akt. 126] THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF AL(JEBRA 209 

The algebraic solution of the cubic and ([uartic equations 
which we have given, always gives rise to real or complex 
numbers as roots of such equations. Again we mav state 
the results thus : Every cubic function As^ + Bj'^ + Ox + D 
may be expressed as a product of three linear functions with 
real or complex coefficients. These three linear functions 
may either be different from each other, or else two, or even 
all three of them, may be identical. The situation is similar 
in the case of a quartic function. 

Again, we saw in Art. 120 that every equation of the form 
x" â€” a = has n distinct complex numbers as roots. Accord- 
ing to the factor theorem, then, x" â€” a may be expressed as a 
product of 71 linear factors witli complex coefficients. 

All of these things we have 'ActnaWy proved. They sug- 
gest that the following theorem is probably true. 

A. Every mteyral rational function of the nth degree cari he 
decomposed into a product of n factors of the first degree, the 
coefficients of the factors being real or complex numbers. 

If we associate with each of these factors a root of the cor- 
responding equation, one root for each linear factor whether 
the factors are all different from each other or not, we may 
also state this theorem as follows. 

B. Every equation of the nth degree with real or complex 
numbers as coefficients has precisely n roots, each of ivhich is a 
real or complex number. 

This theorem is usually known as the fundamental theorem of Algebra. 
We have actually proved it for n = 1, 2, 8, and 1. TIh' theorem was first 
formulated by Gikahd (1590-1G32, Dutch) iu his Inrent'um nouvelle en 
ralgehre, published in 1029. But the first satisfactory proof of the 
theorem for all values of n was given by Gauss iu his doctor's disserta- 
tion of 1799. All of the proofs which had been attempted before then, by 
d'Alembert (1717-1783, French), by Euler (1707-1783, Swiss), and 
by Lagrange (1736-1813, French but born in Italy), were inaccurate. 

As we have indicated in tiie preliminary discussion, the 
statement A is, in some respects, preferable to statement B. 
There are actually always precisely n linear factors, but 



210 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 126 

some of them may be equal to each other, giving rise to 
factors of the form {x â€” a)^ (x â€” a)^, etc. In such cases 
the corresponding equation seems to iiave fewer than n roots, 
and statement B only remains true as a consequence of the 
agreement that such a root a shall be counted more than 
once. These are the so-called multiple roots of the equa- 
tion. (See Art. 109.) 

The proof of the fundamental theorem is too difficult to 
be given here completely. However, this proof is composed 
of two parts, a difficult and an easy part. The difficult part 
may be stated as follows : 

C. If any integral rational function 

/(.r) = ^.r" + Bx"-^ + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ ^ Lx + M 

is given, whose coefficients A, B, â– â– â– .L, M are any real or 
complex numbers, there always exists at least one real or com- 
plex number a-j, for tvhich the function f (x) assumes the value 
zero. That is, the equation f (x) = has at least one real or 
complex root x^ 

If we grant this much, we can show at once (this is the 
easy part of the proof) that the equation has exactly n 
roots, and not merely a single one. 

For let rcj be the one root of / (.r) = whose existence is 
assured by theorem C. Then a; â€” a;^ is a factor of f (x), 
and we shall have 

(1) /(^) = i^ - ^O/iC^), 

where f-^ipo) is an integral rational function of degree n â€”1. 
According to theorem C, the equation f^i^x) = has a root ; 
call it x^. Then x â€” x^is di factor of /j(a;), so that 

(2) f,(^x) = ix-x,y^{x\ 

where /2(a:) is of degree n â€” 2. From (1) and (2) we find 

(3) / (x) = {x - .r 1 )(x- x^^ (.-c) . 
As we continue in this way we finally find 

(4) /(a;) =(x- x^){x -x^) â– â– â–  {^x - x^}A, 



Akt. 126] THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA 211 

where A does not contain x at all, so that A is a constant. 
Thus /(a^) has precisely n linear factors x â€”x^, â€¢â€¢â€¢, x â€” xâ€ž. 
and this is the fundamental theorem in the form as given in 
statement A. 

The formula (4) leads to an im}3ortant corollary. It 
shows that /(.t) will become equal to zero for x = x^^ for 
x= x^, â€¢â– â– â– , for X = Xn, and for no other values of x, unless 
A should happen to be equal to zero. Of course, if ^ = 0, 
the function /(a;) will be equal to zero for all values of x, 
and all of the coefficients of /(a:) in its expanded form would 
be equal to zero. Wo may formulate this as follows : 

D. If an integral rational function of the nth order is equal 
to zero for more than n distinct values of x^ then it will be equal 
to zero for all values of x. 

If an equation f(x') = holds for all values of x, it is 
called an identity, and the sign = is frequently used to indi- 
cate such an identical equation. For the sake of contrast 
an equation which is not an identity is frequently called a 
conditional equation. We may now reformulate D as 
follows : 

E. If an i7ite(/ral rational function of the nth order 

f (x) = Ax'' + Bx"-'^ + â€¢â€¢ â–  + Lx -f M 

is equal to zero for more than n distinct values of x, then it is 
equal to zero identically^ and we must have 

We have already used some special cases of this theorem 
(see Art. 123, for instance) and we shall soon apply it again. 
Most of the applications will present themselves in the fol- 
lowing form.

of a:, such as 

(2) x=a + hi h ^ 0,

which reduces to a real number, if and only if Q happens to 
be equal to zero. 

Let us now consider the value 

(4) X = a â€” hi, 

which is conjuf^ate to (2). (See Art. 34.) We shall find 

(5) f(^a-hi) = P-QU 

which is conjugate to (8). To prove this statement observe 
first that, since we are assuming the coefficients of (1) to be 
real, the symbol i enters into the expression (3) oi f (^a +hi) 
only because i occurs in x= a-{- hi. Since, in the second 
place, a â€” hi may be written a -(-^(â€” ^), the valueof /(Â« â€” ii) 
may be obtained from that oifQa + hi) if we replace i, when- 
ever it occurs in the latter expression, by â€” i. But this last 
statement is equivalent to (o). 

We may therefore state tlie following theorem : An integral 
rational function f {x) with real coefficients assumes conjugate 
complex values for conjugate complex values of the independent 
variable x. 

If rt + hi is a root of the equation /(.r) = 0, we have 

(6) f(a + hi) = P + Qi = 0, 

an equation which implies two others, namely 

(7) P = Q = 0. (See Art. 25.) 
But then we shall also have, on account of (5) and (7), 

(8) f(a-hi) = P- Qi = 0, 

so that a â€” hi is also a root of the equation / (a;) = 0. 

Thus, if an equation with real coefficients has as one of 
its roots an imaginarij numher a + hi, the conjugate of this 
number, namely a â€” hi, will also he a root of the same equation.* 

* III formulating: this theorem we have used the word iniaf/inanj rather than 
the word compk'.r, for the followiiis; reason. Accordintj to the hest usage, the 
term complex number is used for all numbers of the form a + hi and therefore in- 
cludes in particular the real numbers, namely, if ^ =. 0. We use the term imagi- 
nary number for those complex numbers which are not real, that is, for those for 
which It is not equal to zero. The above theorem is true for all complex numbers, 
inchidinji reals, but it is of no interest in the latter case since the conjugate of a 
real number a is that same real number. 



214 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 127 

This fact is often expressed as follows. Tlie imaginary 
roots of an equation with real coefficients occur in pairs. 

From this it follows at once, that an equation with real 
coefficients either has no imaginary roots at all or else an even 
number of them. It cannot have an odd number of imaginary 
roots. 

Consequently, an equation of odd degree., with real coeffi- 
cients, always has at least one real root. 

Let a + hi be an imaginary root of the equation with real 
coefficients, 

(9) f(^x) = Ax"" + 5a;"-i + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + ice + iÂ¥ = 0. 

Then a â€” hi is also a root of (9). Consequently xâ€” (^a-{-hi') 
and a^ â€” (a â€” 5^') are factors oif{x). (See Art. 84.) But we 
have 

[re â€” (a + hi)'] \^x â€” (a â€” hi')'] =â–  (x â€” a â€” bi^Qx â€” a -\- bi^ 

= (^xâ€” a)^+ b^. 

That is, these two conjugate complex linear factors of /(.r) 
combine into a single real quadratic factor. If we combine 
this result with the fundamental theorem, we obtain the fol- 
lowing theorem : 

An integral rational fu7iction with real coefficients may al- 
ways be expressed as a product of real linear and real quadratic 
factors.

9. Discuss examples 1-10 of Exercise XLTII again, making use of

10. Making use of the notions permanence and complete equation, ex- 
plained in Example 11 of Exercise XLIII, prove the following theorem : 
If a complete equation has all of its roots real, it will have as many posi-

128. Use of the factored form of /(jc) in plotting. If the 
linear factors of a function /(a;) are known, it is very easy to 
draw the graph of the function. Its intersections with the 
a;-axis are obtained by a mere inspection of the factors. 
Moreover, the sign of each factor, and consequently the sign 
of f(x), for a given value of a;, may also be obtained by 
inspection. The form of the graph, in a given instance, de- 
pends of course upon the nature of the factors of f(x)- 
Consequently we are led to distinguish the following three 
cases. 

Case I. All of the linear factors of /(a;) are real and 
distinct. 

Case II. All of the linear factors of /(a;) are real but 
they are not all distinct. 

Case III. Some of the linear factors of /(a,-) are imaginary. 

129. Form of the graph in the case of real and distinct 

factors. 

Illustrative Example. Let/(jr) = (x - l)(x - 2)(x - 3). Then 
the graph of y - f{x) will intersect the a.-axis in the three points. A, B, 
and C, of Fig. 55, for which x has the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. 
Let us divide the plane into four regions by drawing the lines AL, BM, 
and CN, parallel to the /y-axis through A, B, and C respectively. 




Fig. 55. 



INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 129 

Any point to the left of AL has an abscissa 
less than unity. For such a point we shall have 

x-KO, a;-2<0, x-3<0, 
and consequently 

y= (x - \)(x - 2){x -3)<0. 

Therefore all points of our graph to the left of AL 
have negative ordinates. In particular we find for 
X = 0, y = ( â€” 1) (â€” 2) { â€” -i) = â€” Q, giving the point 
D of Fig. 55. 

The abscissa x of any point between AL and 
BM satisfies the inequalities 

X - 1 > 0, X - 2 < 0, X - .} < 0. 

Consequently, we shall have for such a point 

y = (x - l)(x - 2)(x - 2) > 0. 

That is, all points of our graph which lie between AL and BM have positive 
ordinates. 

In particular, we find for x â€” 3/2, 

x=3/2, ^= i(- i)(_|)= + f, 
giving the point marked between A and B. 

The abscissa of any point between BM and CN satisfies the in- 
equalities 

X - 1 > 0, X - 2 > 0, X - 3 < 0, 
making 

^ ^ = (x-l)(x-2)(x-3)<0. 

Therefore, all points of our graph between BM and CN have negative 
ordinates. 

In particular we find, for x = 5/2, 

^ = lÂ» y = i(i)(~ 2) = ~ f> 
giving the point marked between B and C. 

The abscissa of any point to the right of CN satisfies the inequalities 

X - 1 > 0, .r - 2 > 0, X - 3 > 0, 
making 

//=(x-l)(x-2)(x-3) 

positive. Therefore, all points of our graph to the right of CN have positive 
ordinates. 

The form of the graph, as indicated in Fig. 55, is now apparent. 
This form will not be altered very essentially if we replace 

(x-l)(x-2)Cx-3) 
by /l(x-l)(x-2)(x-3), 

where A is any positive or negative constant.

are n distinct real numbers arranged in ascending order of magnitude. 

130. Form of the graph in the case of real factors some of 
which are repeated. 

Illustkative Example. Let f(x) = (x â€” l)'^(x â€” 2). Then the 
graph of the function >/ =/(x) has the points A and B of Fig. 56 in 
common with the x-axis, since ?/ = for x = 1 and for ^y j^ j,^ 
X = 2. But this time the curve does not cross the x-axis 
at A ; it merely touches it. We draw the lines AL and 
BM parallel to the ^-axis. For all points to the left of 
^L we have 

a;< 1, X - 1 <0, X - 2<0 

and therefore Fig. 56. 



(x - 1)2 > 0, X - 2 < 0, >j = {x - \y-{x - 2)< 0. 

Thus all points on our graph to the left of AL are below the x-axis. 
For every point between .4 L and BM, we have 

X - 1 > 0, X - 2 < 0. 

Since (x â€” 1)^ occurs as a factor of f(x) we find y <0 for x> 1 as well 
as for x<l. Therefore all points on our graph between AL and BM 
are again below the x-axis. Consequently the graph passes through A 
but does not cross the x-axis at this point. According to Rolle's theorem 
(.\rt. 108) it touches the x-axis at .1. In fact if we expand /(x) and 
compute its derivative /' (x), we sliall find /'(I) = 0, so tliat the tangent 
of the graph at A is the .r-axis. At B the curve crosses the x-axis. 

This case, illustrated in Fig. 56, may be regarded as 
resulting from the case illustrated in Fig. 55 by allowing the 
point B of Fig, 55 to approach the point A as a limit. 



218 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 130 

From this point of view we may think of the curve as cross- 
ing the 2;-axis at A (Fig. 56) twice, or of a point P which 
moves along the curve as crossing the a^-axis at A and immedi- 
ately crossing back again. We should therefore conclude 
that a curve obtained from that of Fig. 55 by allowing all 
of the three points A, B, and C to coincide would correspond 
to the graph of ^=(^x â€” 1)^. It is clear from 
/ Fig. 57, which represents the graph of (a; â€” 1)^, 

Ay that we may actually think of it in this way. 

This form of the graph is characteristic of such 
/ cases in which a linear factor occurs cubed.

131. Form of the graph when some of the linear factors are 
imaginary. If f{.r) is an integral rational function with 
real coeliicients, its imaginary factors occur in conjugate 
pairs, and each of tliese pairs gives rise to a real quadratic 
factor (Art. 127). Moreover the quadratic factors obtained 
in this way do not vanish for any real value of x. Conse- 
quently, if n is the degree of / {x) and if / (x-) has 2 k 
imaginary factors, the graph oif{x) will intersect the a;-axis 
only in nâ€” 2 k points.

132. Relations between the roots and the coefficients of an 
algebraic equation. We found it to be impossible (see Art. 
125) to find a simple expression for the roots of an equation 
of the nth order in terms of its coefficients. But the inverse 
problem, to express the coeiHcients in terms of the roots, may 
be solved with ease. 

Let 

(1) Â«(,:?;" + a^a;"-! + a^x''-'^ + â€¢â€¢ â€¢ + a^-iX + Â«â€ž = 

be any given equation. If we divide both members by Uq, we 
obtain the equivalent equation

Let a:j, x^-, â– â€¢â–  Xn be the roots of this equation. According 
to the factor theorem x â€” x^, x â€” x^,--x â€” Xn will then be 
factors of /(a;), that is, of the left member of (2). (See 
Art. 84.) According to the fundamental theorem of Algebra 



220 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 132 

(Art. 126), f i^x) has exactly n linear factors. Therefore 
/ (x) has no other factor depending upon x ; that is, the 
quotient

(X â€” X^^(X â€” Xc^^) â– â– â–  {x-x^}

must hold for all values of x, that is, it must be an identity. 
Therefore the following equation, obtained from (5) by 
multiplying together the factors x â€” x^, x â€” x^, x â€” x^, etc., of 
the right member, 

(6) a:" + |>i2-"'-i + ^^2:c"-2 + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + Pn-i-t' + Pn

must also be an identity. 

But according to Art. 126, Theorem F, an identity of this 
form can subsist only if the corresponding powers of x in the 
two members of the equation have the same coefficients. 
The coefficients of x" on the right and left members are A and 
1 respectively. Therefore A must be equal to unity, and we 
shall have besides, comparing the coefficients of corresponding 
powers of x in the two members,

where the + or â€” sign is to be used in the last equation ac- 
cording as n is even or odd. 

We have already obtained these relations in the special 
cases when w = 2 or 3 (Art. 68 and Art. 123). The gen- 
eral relations (7) were tirst discovered .by Girard. (See 
the historical note, Art. 123.) 

133. Symmetric functions. The expressions which occur 
in the riglit members of (7 j, Art. 132, have important prop- 
erties. Except for sign, p^ is equal to the sum of all of the 
roots, and therefore jOj does not change its value if any two 
of these roots are interchanged. Again p^ is equal to a sum, 
each term of which is equal to a product of two of the roots, 
and all possible products of this sort occur in p^. Therefore 
p^ will not be changed if any two of the roots are inter- 
changed. The same thing is true of jOg, p^, â€¢â– â€¢,Pn- We shall 
be able to express these facts very concisely with the aid of 
the following definition. 

An expression S(x-^, x.^, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢, .râ€ž), involving n letters x^, a^g, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢Â» a;â€ž 
is said to be a symmetric function of x^, x^-, â– â– â– -, x^ if its value is 
left unaltered ivhen any two of these letters are interchanged. 

Thus, xi^ + x.^ + x^ is a symmetric function of x,, Xj, x^. But x-^ 
â€” 2 Xo^ + 3 x.i- is not symmetric. For if we interchange xâ– ^^ and x^, this 
becomes x^^ â€” 2x^-+'^ x^-, which is not the same as the original expression. 

We may now express a part of what is involved in equa- 
tions (7) of Art. 132 as follows. 

The coefficients of an algebraic equation of the form 

X"" + p^X''-'^ -\- p^X""'"^ + â– â€¢â€¢ +Pn-l^+Pn=^ 

are symmetric functions of its roots. 

The expressions Pj, p^^, â– â€¢â–  Pn ^re more specifically called the 
fundamental symmetric functions on account of the following 
important theorem due to Newton. 

Any integral rational function ofx-^^ x^^ â€¢â€¢o ^n which is sym- 
metric can be expressed as an integral rational function of the 
n fundamental symmetric functions p^, p-^ â– â– â–  Pn- 



222 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 134 

No proof of this theorem will be attempted in this book. 

It is clear from what we have said that the fundameiital 
symmetric functions of the roots of a given equation may be ob- 
tained from that equation by inspection^ although the indi- 
vidual roots themselves may be entirely unknown. This 
remark is very important in many applications. 

EXERCISE LVIII 

1. Solve the equation x^ â€” Q x- + 26 a; â€” 24 = 0, making use of the in- 
formation that the three roots of the equation form an arithmetical pro- 
gression. 

2. Find the roots of x^ â€” 8 a;^ + 5 a; + 14 = 0, making use of the fact 
that the sum of two of the roots is equal to 9. 

3- Given a cubic equation x^ + p^x'^ + p.^x + p.. = 0. Find a formula

4. If 7^, = 0, what can we say about the roots of the corresponding 
equation ? 

5. Solve x^ â€” 8 x^ + 5 a; + .50 = 0, being given that two of the roots are 
equal. 

134. Vanishing and infinite roots. If the equation 

(1) /' (a;) = a^^x^ + a^x"-'^ + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + (tn-iX -^a^ = 

has one of its roots equal to zero,/(i') must reduce to zero 
when we put x = 0. Therefore Â«â€ž must be equal to zero. 
The same thing results from the factor theorem. For if 
a; = is a root of /(.r) = 0, x must be a factor of fii-c)- If 
x= is a multiple root^ taking the place of k simple roots^ x'' 
must be a factor off(x^; that is, the coefficients of the k terms 
of lotvest order in (1) must be eqtial to zero. 

Tlie same result might have been obtained from equations 
(7) of Art. 132. 

Instead of considering a single equation of form (1), let 
us now consider a whole chain of such equations. Let the 
coefhcients a^ a^--- a^ be the same for all of the equations of 
the chain, so that the individual equations will differ from 
each other only in regard to the value of Â«q. Let us assume 
further that aâ€ž is different from zero, and that a^ approaches 



Art. l:3i] VANISHING AND INFINITE ROOTS 223 

zero as we pass from the first equation to the second, from 
the second to the third, and so on. 

An example will make clear what these assumptions mean. Let the 
equations all be quadratics, and let 

1) 1*5^-^4 5x -7 = 0, 

2) T^ x--^ + 5 X - 7 = 0, 

3) ToVff ^â– 'â– ^ + -"'a: - 7 = 0, 

k) _Lj;2+ 5x - 7 = 0, 

be the first k equations of the chain. For the A-th equation we have 
1 - 7 

The values of a^ and a^ are the same for all equations of the chain ; aâ€ž, in 
our case aâ€ž, is different from zero since a^ â€” â€” 7. Finally Oq is different 
from equation to equation and approaches zero as a limit as k- gi'ows be- 
yond bound. 

According to (7), Art. 132, we have 



if a^j, 2^2' â€¢â€¢â– ' ^n ai'e the roots of equation (1). As a^ 
approaches zero, the quotient aJaQ will grow beyond 
bound, since a^ is different from zero by hypothesis. Con- 
sequently at least one of the roots a^i.a^g, â€¢â€¢â€¢â– tX^, whose prod- 
uct, according to (2), is equal to aâ€ž/Â«o, must grow beyond 
bound. 

So far in this discussion we have assumed a^^O. If in- 
stead aâ€ž = 0, the equation (1) has at least one root equal to 
zero ; that is, f(x) has some power of x as a factor. If 
we divide f{x) by this power of .r and apply our argument 
to the resulting equation, which has no vanishing roots, we 
conclude that at least one of its roots, which is also a root of 
the original equation, must grow beyond all bound when a^ 
approaches zero as a limit. 

Therefore we have the following result. //' the coefficient 
a^, of the highest power of x in an equation of the form 



224 INTEGRAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 134 

(1) ((qX" + a^x"-'^ + â€¢'â€¢ + aâ€ž_i^' + Â«â€ž = 

be regarded as a variable which approaches the limit zero, then 
at least one of the roots of the equation will grow beyond bound. 

This is sometimes expressed by saying that the equation 
has an infinite root. 

We may state the following more general and more pre- 
cise result. 

If the first k coefficients of (1) be regarded as variables which 
simidtaneously approach the limit zero, but if the (k + V)th 
coefficient of (1) remains finite., then precisely k of the roots of 
(1) ivill grow beyond bound. 

In this case the equation is said to have k infinite roots. 
To prove this last theorem we might proceed as in the case 
of one infinite root, making use of equations (7) of Art. 132. 
But it is easier to reduce the case of infinite roots to the case 
of vanishing roots by means of the transformation 

(3) a;=-, y = -. 

y ^ 

If we make this substitution in (1), we find, after clearing 
of fractions, 

(4) a^ + a^y + a^"^ + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + aâ€ž_^yÂ«-'^ + a^y"" = 0. 

From (3) it is clear that the roots ?/p y^.. â€¢â€¢â€¢ y^ of (4) and the 
roots a^j, 2^21 â€¢â€¢â€¢ ^n of (1) ^^e so related that we may put 

1 1 1 

X-^ X,^ X^ 

Consequently, if k roots of (1), say x^, x^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ x,^, grow beyond 
bound, then k roots of (4), namely y^, y^, â– â€¢â–  3/^, will approach 
the limit zero. But we have seen that (4) will have exactly 
k vanishing roots, if and only if the left member of (4) con- 
tains y''' as a factor, that is, if a^ = a^= â€¢â€¢â€¢ = a^._| = 0, %^ 0. 
Therefore we have proved our theorem about the infinite 
roots of (1). This tlieorem finds an important application 
in analytic geometry in the theory of asymptotes.

CHAPTER VI 

FRACTIONAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS 

135. Definition of a rational function. If we divide one 
integral rational function by another, two cases may present 
themselves ; the division may be exact or not. In the 
former case the quotient is again an integral rational func- 
tion, and may therefore be studied by the methods of 
Chapters IV and V. In the latter case, the quotient is a 
new kind of a function, known as a fractional rational 
function. The fractional and integral rational functions 
together constitute the class of rational functions. 

Every function which can he expressed either as an integral 
rational function, or else as a quotient of two integral rational 
functions, is called a rational function. 

For the sake of brevity we shall often speak of a fractional 
rational function as a rational fraction. The two integral 
rational functions, of which the rational fraction is the 
quotient, may be called its numerator and denominator. 

Thus ~ is a rational fraction.

x^ â€” 3 X + 2 is its numerator, and x^ â€” 4 is its denominator. 

136. Proper and improper rational fractions. We shall say 
that a rational fraction is a proper fraction if its numerator 
is of lower degree than its denominator ; we shall call it an 
improper fraction if the degree of the numerator is as high 
as, or higher than, that of the denominator. We observe im- 
mediately that a rational function which is represented hy an 
improper fraction may he expressed as the sum of an integral 
rational function and a proper fraction.

Art. l:5(ij 1>R0PER AND IMPROPER FRACTIONS 227 

Thus we have, for instance, 



X â€” 1 Xâ€” 1 X â€” 5 X â€” 5 

The integral part of a rational fnnction is obtained as the 
quotient in the process of dividing the numerator by the 
denominator. The remainder obtained in this division, if 
there is a remainder, will be the numerator of the proper 
fraction which must be added to the integral part in order 
that the sum may be equal to the given improper fraction. If 
the remainder is zero, the given rational fraction is really an in- 
tegral rational function ; it is fractional only in appearance. 

The notions, proper and improper fraction, are very closely related to 
the corresponding notions in arithmetic. In arithmetic d/D is said to 
be a projier fraction if d is less than D, an improper fraction if d is not 
less than D. Thus the notion " lower degree " takes the place of the 
similar notion " less than," as we extend the terminology of arithmetic 
to the field of rational functions. 

In one very important respect the theorems about rational 
functions differ essentially from the corresponding theorems 
about the fractions of arithmetic. The sum of two proper 
arithmetical fractions may be an impi'oper fraction. Tims 
1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4. But for rational functions we have the 
theorem: the sum of two rational functions^ each of which is 
a proper fraction, is always again a proper fraction. 

For let -p r ^ -f r \ 

be two proper rational fractions, so that /j(.?') and ./^^-^O ^^^

This is again a rational fraction (compare the definition in 
Art. 135), and the numerator is of lower degree than the 
denominator. 

We shall soon n)ake an important application of this 
theorem. 



228 FRACTIONAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 137 

137. Reduction of a rational function to its lowest terms. 
Let /.^ X 

be a rational function of x, f{x) and ^(a;) being integral 
rational functions of degree m and n respectively. Accord- 
ing to the fundamental theorem (Art. 126), f^x) may be 
written as a product of the form 

/(a;) = A(x - aj^^)(x - a^) ... (x - a^), 

where ^ is a constant, and where a^, a^^ â€¢â€¢â€¢ a^ are m numbers 
whicli may be real or imaginary, all distinct, or some or all 
of them equal to each other. Similarly we shall have 

[/(x-) = B(x - h^X^ - h^y-.(x - 6â€ž), 

and therefore 

From this expression we may conclude that R(x^ will 
become equal to zero when x assumes any one of the m values 
aj, ^2' â– â– â– ' ^mi unless the same value of x should also cause the 
denominator of (2) to vanish. The fraction R(x) would 
not be defined for such a value of x, since it would then as- 
sume the form 0-^0, which is meaningless. (See Art. 21.) 
But the denominator of (2) can vanish only when x becomes 
equal to one of the values h^^ h^^ â– â€¢â–  h^. Consetiuently, the 
rational fraction R(x) can assume the indeterminate form. 0/0 
only if its numerator and denominator, have a factor in common 
ivhich contains x. 

Thus, if J,,. ^ 2(a: + 5)(x + 3)(.r-l) 

^ ^ (x + 7)(x + 3) 

we find r. 

^ ^ 
We may divide both terms of a fraction by the same number (provided 
that the divisor is different from zero) without changing the value of the 
fraction. Now a; + 3 is different from zero whenever x is not e(]ual to 
â€” 3. Therefore, the above fraction /?(x), and the simpler function 



Art. 137] REDUCTION TO LOWEST TERMS 229 

X + 7 
are equal to each other for all values of x except for x = â€” 3. For 
X = â€” 3 these functions are not equal. In fact ii'(â€” 3) has no meaning, 

whereas R,(- 3) = ^'"^"^^ = - 4.

The illustration just given suggests the following defini- 
tion : 

//' the numerator and denominator of a rational fraction 
have a common factor containing x^ the rational function is not 
in its lowest terms. To reduce it to its lowest terms we divide 
both uuinerator arid denominator by their highest common 
factor. 

If the rational function Rix) is not in its lowest terras, 
and if R^Qc) is the function obtained from R{x) by reduc- 
ing to lowest terms, we shall have 

R^x) = R^(x) 

for all values of x excepting those for which R(x) is not 
defined at all ; namely, those which give rise to a meaning- 
less expression of the form 0/0 for RQx'). 

The reduction of a rational function to its lowest terms is 
easily accomplished when the linear factors of numerator 
and denominator are all known. But ordinarily this is not 
the case. However, it is not necessary to knoiv all of the 
linear factors of the numerator and denominator hi order to 
accomplish this reduction. It suffices to know their highest 
common factor, and this may ahvays be obtained by the method 
of successive division ivhich is essentially the same as the pro- 
cess for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. 
(See Art. 5.)

138. Zeros of a rational function. Let 

be a rational function in its lowest terms. If a^ a^, â– â– â€¢ a^ 
are the roots of the equation /(.r) = 0, then R(x) will be 
equal to zero when x assumes one of these values. We shall 
therefore speak of these values a^, a^^ â€¢â– â€¢ a^ as the zeros 
of RQx). We should perhaps, more specifically, call them 
the finite zeros of R(x^t since 7t(.r), if it is a proper fraction, 
approaches zero as a limit when x grows beyond bound, as 
we shall see later. Of course some or all of tha zeros of 
RQc) inay be imaginary. Moreover, several of the roots 
ftj, ^21 â€¢â– â–  *m o^ tliG equation f (x) = may coincide, that is, 
/(x) may have a repeated factor. If /(a;) has (x â€” rt^)** 
as a factor, a^ is called a multiple zero of f(x'), and the 
number r is called the multiplicity of this multiple zero. 

139. Poles of a fractional rational function. If 5^, b^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ bâ€ž 

are the roots of the equation g(^x) = 0, the function R{x^ is 
not defined for x = b^, x = b2', - â€¢ â–  x = h^. We should have, 
for instance, n^i ^ /-^i n 

where /(Jj) is different fi^om zero, since the fraction is sup- 
posed to be in its lowest terms. 

Thus the function ,,/ \ x + 4 

X â€” 1 
is not defined for x = 1. But it is defined for all other values of x. Let 
X approach 1 as a limit. Then the numerator will approach the limit 5, 



Art. UO] GRAPH OF A RATIONAL FUNCTION 231 

and the denominator, x â€” 1, will approach the limit zero. As the 
denominator becomes smaller and smaller, the value of the fraction will 
grow beyond all bounds. We express this by saying that R(x) becomes 
infinite as x approaches 1 as a limit, and we say that x = 1 is a pole of 
the function R(x). 

If a fractional rational function is written in its lowest 
terms, the function c/roivs beyond hound, or (^as we sat/} becomes 
infinite, when x approaches as a limit one of the zeros of its 
denominator. These values of x are called the poles of the 
rational function. 

These poles will be real or imaginary, simple or multiple, 
according as the zeros of the denominator are real or imagi- 
nary, simple or multiple. 

140. Graph of a fractional rational function. We may 
make a graph of a given fractional rational function RQc) as 
in the case of an integral rational function. We put 

y = RQx^), 

assume arbitrary values for x, compute the corresponding 
values of y, and plot the points whose coordinates are 
obtained in this way. But in doing this we should pay 
special attention to the poles of R(x}, if i2(a:) has any real 
poles. 

Thus, if we wish to make a graph of the rational function 

1 

2/ = -. 

X 

we observe at once that x = is a pole, the only one in this case. For 
X = 0, y is not defined. But we may compute values of y corresponding 
to values of x which are very close to zero. We find the values indicated 
in the following tables : 

....1 BCD E- A' B' C D' E' - 

x-:5 2 1 I \ 1 _ i _l _o _3 ... 

>j.:\ \ 1 2 4 - -4 -2 -1 -i -y. 

The corresponding points are plotted in Fig. 58 which shows clearly the 
essential properties of this graph. As x approaches zero, decreasing 
toward zero from positive values, y becomes positively infinite. As x 
approaches zero through negative values, y becomes negatively infinite. 



232 



FRACTIONAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 140 



Fig. 58 



Thus, there is a discontinuity (break) in the 
vicinity of x = 0. The other jjoints of the 
grapli are easily supplied. They show that 
y approaches zero as x grows beyond 
bound, either through positive or negative 
values. 

The curve obtained in this example 
belongs to the class of curves called hyper- 
bolas. This particular hyperbola is, more 
specifically, called a rectangular hyperbola 
on account of the intimate relation which 
it has to two perpendicular lines, the 
X-axis and ^-axis, which are known as its 
asymptotes.

Art. 141] FACTORED FORM OF A RATIONAL FUNCTION 233 

141. General form of a rational function in terms of its 
zeros and poles. Let 

be a rational function in its lowest terms ; and let /(a:) and 
^(a;) be of degrees m and w respectively. Then we may 
write 

f{x) = A{x~a^){x-a^) â– â– â€¢ {x -a^),

Formula (1) (/ives an explicit expression for the most (jeneral 
rational function which has the values a^, a^. â€¢â€¢â€¢ a^ as zeros, and 
the values b^, b,^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ b^ as poles. 

Since we have assumed R(x') to be in its lowest terms, 
each of the numbers a^, â€¢ â–  â€¢ a^ will be different from each of 
the quantities b^, b^ â– â– â€¢ b^. 

If several of the a's are identical, say a-^ = a^ = â€¢â€¢â–  â€” a^, 
then aj is called a zero of multiplicity r (Art. 138), and 
the numerator of R{x) has (x â€” a^y as a factor. If several

When a rational function is expressed in tlie form (1) or

EXERCISE LXll 

Write down the most general rational function which has the follow- 
ing numbers as zeros and poles : 

1. Simple zeros for x = 1, 2, 3 ; simple poles for x = 4, 5, 6. 

2. Simple zeros for x= -1, 0, + 1 ; simple poles for x= - 2, +2, +3. 

3. Simple zeros for a; = 1, a zero of multiplicity 3 for a; = 2, a pole of 
multiplicity 2 for x = 3, and a simple pole for x = 4. 

142. Partial fractions. Let 

(1) ^(0 =4^ 

be a proper rational fraction in its lowest terms. Then /(a:) 
will be of lower degree than g^x}. If g(^x) is of degree n, 
let x â€” x^, X â€”x^, â– â– â–  X â€” Xr, be the n linear factors of g(x), 
and let us assume that all of these factors are distinct. 
Since R{x^ is in its lowest terms, none of these factors will 
be factors oif(x), and consequently, x-^, x^, â– â– â–  x^ will be poles 
of R(x). 

We may then write R{x~) as follows : 

(2) M(x) = -^ ^, ^ 7 T^' 

(x-Xi){x-x^) â– â– â–  {X-Xr,} 

where the numerator of i2(2;) is at most of degree w â€” 1, 
since we have assumed B(^x) to be a proper fraction. This 
expression contains precisely n constants a^, rtj, â€¢ â–  â€¢ aâ€ž_j which 
may have any value whatever, and it is the most general 
expression of its kind. Therefore, the most general proper

This sum is a rational function of x ; its poles are the same

Art. 142] PARTIAL FRACTIONS FOR SIMPLE POLES 235 

fraction, their sum is a proper fraction. (See Art. 136.) 
Therefore tliis sum may be rewritten in the form (2), by 
reducing the several fractions in (3) to the common denomi- 
nator (^x â€” x^(x â€” j'^) â€¢â€¢â€¢ {x â€” Xn) and adding. Moreover 
the'n coefficients A^ A^-, â€¢â€¢â–  Anin (3) can be determined in 
such a way as to make the sum (3) exactly equal to any 
given expression of the form (2). 

The following example will illustrate this statement and show, at the 
same time, how these coefficients Ai â– â€¢â€¢ .1,, may be determined. 
Let 

^' ^' (x-l)(x-2)(x-3) 

This is a proper fraction, and it is in its lowest terms; for the numerator 
does not vanish when we put x equal to 1, 2, or 3. We therefore attempt 
to determine the coefficients A, B, C, in such a way as to make the sum 

(â€¢'">) ^ + -^+-^,-^(^). 

X â€” 1 X â€” 2 X â€” i 

or, what amounts to the same thing, so as to make

or

^^ (x-l)(x-2)(x-3) ^^^- 

The denominator of -ff(x), as given by (4), and of the left member of 

(7) are exactly the same. Consequently the fractions (4) and (7) will 
be equal for all values of x (identically equal), if and only if their 
numerators are identically equal, that is, if and only if 

(.4 + B+ C)x-2+ (- 5^-4J5-3C)x+6^+35+2 C=2x2-r)x + 7. 

According to Art. 126, Theorem F, this will be so if and only if 

A + B + C^ 2, 

(8) -.5.4 -45-3 C==- 5, 

6 /I + 3 5 + 2 C = 7. 

The solution of (8) gives A = 2, B = â€” 5, C = + 5. Consequently we 
have, from (4) and (5), the desired result, namely 

-.gx 2 X- - a X -I- 7 _ _2 5_ 5 

^^ (x- l)(x-2^(x-3) x-1 x-2 x-3" 

An easier way of obtaining the same result, avoiding the solution of 
system (8), is as follows. If (6) and (4) are identically equal, we must 
have 



236 FRACTIONAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 142 

(10) A(x - 2)(x - 8) + B{x - l){x - 3) + C(x - l)(x - 2) 

= 2 a:'-2 - 5 a; + 7 
for all values of x. For x = I, (10) gives us 

A(- 1)(- 2) = 2 - 5 +7, whence A = 2. 

Similarly we find from (10) for a: = 2, 

5( + 1) ( _ 1) = 2 â€¢ 4 - 5 . 2 + 7, whence B =-5; 

and for x = 'â– '> 

C(+ 2)(+ 1)= 2 â€¢ 9 - 5 . 3 + 7, whence C = + 5. 

The second method indicated in this example is especially 
convenient, and has the advantage of being explicitly appli- 
cable to the general case, thus enabling us to prove that the 
coefficients vlj, A^, â– â€¢â–  A^ in (3) can always be determined 
in such a way as to make the sum (3) equal to any given ex- 
pression of the form (2). We shall refrain from actually 
writing out the formulae, but we shall state the resulting 
theorem. 

Let Ii{x) he a proper rational fraction in its lowest terms, 
whose poles are all distinct, so that the denominator of R(x) 
has no repeated factor. Let x^, x^, â– â– â–  x^he the poles of R{x). 
Then R(x^ may he ivritten in the form 

(11) R{x~) = -^^ + -^a_ + . . . + -Ar^_. 

When a rational function is expressed in this way, it is 
said to be resolved into a sum of simple partial fractions. 

The metliod which we used for resolving RQr) into a sum 
of partial fractions is called the method of undetermined 
coefficients. It is cliaracteristic of this method that we 
assumed an expression with certain unknown coefficients 
(undetermined at the time), and that we found the values of 
these coefficients subsequently by comparing the resulting 
expressions with certain others which were known. 

In applying the above theorem, w% must not forget that 
i2(a;) is assumed to be a proper fraction. If R{x^ is not a 
proper fraction, we must first reduce it to a sum of an in- 
tegral rational function and a proper fraction. (See Art. 



Art. 14:3] PARTIAL FRACTIONS FOR MULTIPLE POLES 237 

13G.) We may then apply the theorem to the hitter part of 
R(x). Again, we assumed also that R(^x) is in its lowest 
terms. If it is not, we must reduce it to its lowest terms 
before attempting to resolve it into partial fractions. Finally 
we assumed the poles of Rijc) to be simple poles, so that the 
linear factors of the denominator are all distinct. We did 
not assume these linear factors to be real. The tlieorem 
applies equally well to the case of real or complex linear 
factors, provided tliat no two of them are equal. In practice, 
however, the formula (11) is usually applied only to the case 
of real and distinct factors.

The numerator of this fraction, which is arranged according

have 

X = a -{-{x â€” a), 

x^= a^ -\- 2 a(^x â€” a) + (2: â€” a)^,

Consequently the numerator of (4) may also be written in

144. Modified form of the partial fractions in the case of im- 
aginary poles. Tlie developments of Arts. 142 and 148 are 
applicable whether the poles are real or imaginary. In 
the latter case, however, the partial fractions obtained in this 
way will also be imaginary, and it is usually convenient, al- 
though not strictly necessary, to avoid the introduction of 
imaginary elements when the function under discussion is a 
real function. 

Suppose then that R(x) is a real rational function, in its 
lowest terms, and a proper fraction. By this we mean that 
all of the coefficients of R(x) are real, so that R{x) assumes 
real values whenever x is real. The poles of Jl{.r)^ which 
are the zeros of the denominator of RQx). will then either be 
real or conjugate complex. (See Art. 34.) In other words, 
the denominator may be regarded as a product of real linear 
and real quadratic factors. (See Art. 127.) Let x^+jjx+q 
be one of these real quadratic factors which cannot be fac- 
tored into two real linear factors. The most general proper 
fraction which has x!^ -{- px -\- q as its denominator will have 
the form 

n\ Ax-\- B 

x^ + px -\- q 

and there must be a term of this form among the partial 
proper fractions whose sum is equal to R{x). This one real 
term takes the place of the two terms with conjugate imag- 
inary linear denominators, which would arise from tlie two 
imaginary linear factors of x'^ + px -f q if we were to apply 
the method of Art. 142. 

If the quadratic factor x"^ + px -\- q is repeated, the corre- 
sponding terms of the expression R(x) as a sum of partial 
fractions may be taken in thÂ«! form 

(2) A,x + B, ^ A_yr + B,_ ^ ^ I --^r^ + ^i 

(x^ + px + qy (x^ + px -f- qy-"^ x^ -\- px + q 

The form (â€¢_*) of the partial fraction development is suggested by the 
following argument. There must be in this development a proper frac- 
tion with (x'^ + px + qy as denominator. Since {x^ + jyx + (/)'â€¢ is of de-

this denominator can have is of the form

in the form

145. Fractional rational equations. An equation all of 
whose terms are rational functions of the unknown qnantiti/ is 
called a rational equation. If at least one of the terms of the 
equation is a fractional function, the equation is a fractional 
equation. 

If there are any terms in the right-hand member of the 
equation, these terms may be transposed. Consequently any 
rational equation may be written in tlie form 

(1) B^ix) + ll,(x) + â– â– â–  -\- E,(-i-) = 0, 

where R^, R^, â– â– â–  Rk denote rational functions of x. If all of 
these functions are integral rational functions, the left 
member of (1) is an integral rational function of .r, and we 



242 FRACTIONAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Anr. 145 

have before us the problem discussed in Chapters IV and V. 
Let us assume, therefore, that at least one of the functions 
i?j, i^g, â€¢ â€¢â€¢ -R/fc is a fraction. If one or several of these terms 
are fractions, let us assume that each one of them is written 
in its lowest terms. Let us assume further that no two of 
these fractions have the same denominator. If two such 
terms with a common denominator should occur, we could 
unite them into a single term. 

The sum of the rational functions R-^{x^, B^^x'), â€¢â€¢â€¢, M^^r^ 
is again a rational function which may be obtained by reduc- 
ing R-^(x), R^(x')^ â€¢â€¢â€¢,i?;t(^) to a common denominator and 
afterward adding the resulting numerators. The sum will 
not be in its lowest terms unless we use for this purpose the 
lowest common denominator, that is, the lowest common mul- 
tiple of the denominators of R^(x^, R^(x)^ 'â€¢â€¢,RkQc). But 
even if we do use the lowest common denominator, we can- 
not be certain that the sum is in its lowest terms. If we 
have, for instance, 

1 2 

â– ^^^''^ = (:,-3)2(:.-2)' ^2^"^^ = (.,-3)2(.r-5)' 

the lowest common denominator is (.r â€” 8)^(2;â€” 2) (2;â€” 5). 
The sum, R^{x^ + R^(x^^ then becomes 

^x- 9 ^_ Z(x- 3) 

(x - ^)\x _ 2)(a; - 5) - (:c - '6)\x - 2) (a; - 5) 

and is not in its lowest terms. 

If, however, we express every one of the rational fractions 
which occurs in (1) as a sum of simple partial fractions, then 
unite all of the partial fractions which have the same denomi- 
nator into a single one, and finally add these ^jartial fractio7is 
together, using as a common denominator the loivest common 
multiple of the denominators of the simple partial fractions, we 
may he sure that the sum R{x^ obtained in this way is in its 
lowest terms. 

Let R(x) be the sum obtained in this way. We may 
write 



Art. U5] FRACTIONAL RATIONAL EQUATIONS 243 

where f(x) and g(x^ are integral rational functions which 
have no common factor involving- x, since R(^x) is in its 
lowest terms. The equation (1) will be replaced by 

(2) i2(^)=/M = o, 

and it will be satisfied by all of the roots of the integral 
rational equation 

(3) fix) = 0. 

Moreover, no other value of x will satisfy equation (1). 

Therefore, all of the finite roots of a fractional rational 
equation may he obtained by solving a certain integral rational 
equation. 

The process of deriving (3) from (1) is commonly 
described as " clearing of fractions.''^ But unless we clear of 
fractions by the process indicated above, first resolving each 
term into a sum of simple partial fractions, the resulting 
integral rational equation may not be correct. For, unless 
the sum 

B^ix) + B,{x) + â– â– â€¢ + Rd-r) = Rix) ='t^ 

is in its lowest terms, we cannot conclude that all of the 
roots of (3) will also be roots of (1), since some of these 
roots would then also cause the denominator g(x) to vanish. 
If we are careful, however, while clearing of fractions not to 
divide by any integral rational expression involving x, we 
may be sure that the resulting integral rational equation 
will contain all of the roots of (1). But it may have other 
roots besides. 

We may formulate some of these results more briefly by 
introducing the following terms. 

A second equation, derived from a first equation, is said 
to be equivalent to the first, if it lias exactly the same roots 



244 FRACTIONAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 146 

as the first. It is said to be redundant if the roots of the 
first equation are included among its roots, and if it has 
other roots besides. The second equation is called defective 
if its roots do not include all of the roots of the original 
equation. 

We have seen that there always exists an integral rational 
equation equivalent to a given fractional rational equation. 
But we have also seen that the usual process of finding this 
equation hy the method of 'â€¢'- clearing of fractions'" is not always 
reliable. If., however., in clearing of fractions., we carefully 
refrain from dividing hy an integral rational function of x, we 
may he sure that the resulting equation loill not he defective. 
We can decide., after solving this equation., whether it is redun- 
dant or equivalent hy testing each of its roots to see whether all 
of them do or do not satisfy the original fractional equation. 

Special care is necessary to avoid dividing by a factor which contains 
X. Inexperienced people often conclude from such an equation as 

x(x - 5) = 0, 

that X = 5 is the only solution. But x = is also a solution of this 
equation.

146. Pressure exerted by gases. Let us suppose that the 
cylinder CC in Fig. 59 contains a certain volume, say Vq 
cubic feet, of air when the movable piston P occupies its 
highest position, and let us compress the air by i)ushing the 
piston down into the position shown in the figure. As we 
push tlie piston down farther and farther, we find that the 
resistance of the inclosed air becomes greater and greater. 



Art. 146] PRESSURE EXERTED BY GASES 245 

Thus the inclosed air exerts a force tending to move tlie 
piston upward, and this force is overcome by the muscular 
force which we exert in pushing the piston 






~'^'' . â€” 1 



c 



down. ^ 

In Fig. 59 the air has been compressed to 
about one third of its original volume. If we 
take a second cylinder of the same height but 
of smaller cross section and compress the air 
in it to one third of its original volume, we 
notice that a smaller force will suffice for this 
purpose than in the case of the first cylinder. 
In fact, measurement of these forces will sliow that they are to 
each other as the cross sections of the two cylinders. Therefore, 
the force which the air exerts upon a unit of area will be the 
same in both cylinders. The force which any gas exerts upon 
a unit area of a containing vessel is called the pressure of the 
gas, and is usually denoted by p. The total force which a 
gas exerts upon an area of A square units will be 

(1) F=Ap 

if p denotes the pressure of the gas. Consequently we have 

(2) P = f. 

Since a unit of force has the dimensions ML/T^ (Art. 80) 
and a unit of area has the dimensions I? (Art. 41), a unit of 
pressure according to (2) has the dimensions 

(3) M/LT^. 

When gas is compressed in a cylinder, as shown in Fig. 
59, the pressure increases, the volume decreases, and ordi- 
narily the temperature of the gas rises. If the cylinder is 
made of metal, we may wait until the original temperature, 
that of the room in which the experiment takes place, has 
reestablished itself. This may be done by inclosing a 
thermometer in G- which may be observed from the outside 
through a glass window. We are thus in a position to 



246 FRACTIONAL RATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 146 

measure the various pressures which the gas exerts upon 
the piston at the various moments when its volume has dif- 
ferent values while its temperature remains the same. Ex- 
periments of this general character were first performed by 
Boyle in 1661, and by Mariotte in 1676. These experi- 
ments lead to what is usually known as Boyle's law. If the 
volume of a gas is changed isothermallg, that is, without chang- 
ing its temperature, its pressure ivill change in such a way that 
the product of pressure and volume remains constant. 

Thus the product pv can depend (for a given mass of a 
given kind of gas) only upon the temperature. The de- 
pendence of this product upon the temperature was investi- 
gated by Gay-Lussac in 1802. He found the equation 

(4) pv=RT,OTp = , 

V 

where T, the so-called absolute temperature of the gas, is 

(5) ^=273 + ^, 

6 being the temperature expressed in Centigrade degrees, 
and where i2 is a constant which depends upon the amount 
of gas which is being used and upon the chemical constitu- 
tion of the gas. 

As a matter of fact, equation (4) is not perfectly exact. 
For high pressures it fails to agree completely with the ex- 
periments, and the following equation, due to Van der 
Waals, is more nearly in accordance with the facts : 

RT a 

V â€” v^ 

where a and h are small quantities which are practically un- 
noticeable except when v becomes very small. Observe 
that (6) reduces to (4) wlien a and b are equal to zero. 
If the temperature remains constant while the gas is 
changing its volume, eacli of the equations (4) and (6) de- 
fines p a,s a. fractional rational function of v.

EXERCISE LXVII 

1. Use a unit on the x-axis to represent a unit of volume and a unit 
on the y-axis to represent a unit of pressure. For a given temperature 
represent the relation expressed by the combined law of Boyle and Gay- 
Lussac graphically. Are negative values of p and v admissible? How 
will the curve change if the temperature changes? 

2. Investigate the form of the curve given by Van der Waal's equa- 
tion. If appropriate units are used, we have II = 0.003G9, a = 0.00874,

correspond to 7' = 250Â°, 300Â°, 350Â°.

CHAPTER VII 

IRRATIONAL FUNCTIONS 

147. Existence of irrational functions. All of the functions 
which we have studied so far were rational functions. But 
there exist many important functions which are not rational. 
The function Va; is such a function. However, the fact that 
Va; is not a rational function of x requires proof. It does 
not follow from the mere presence of a radical sign. 

Let a; be a variable capable of assuming all possible real 
and complex values. Every number x has two square roots 
each of which is determined by the value of x and is there- 
fore a function of x. Let V^ denote either of these square 
roots. We observe first that Va: will he finite whenever x is 
finite. To prove this statement, let x assume any finite com- 
plex value whose modulus is r and whose amplitude is 6. 
(See Art. 30.) Then r is a finite positive number. Both 
square roots of x will have the positive finite number Vr as 
their common modulus, and their amplitudes will be 6/2 and 
^/2-h180Â° respectively. (Art. 120.) In other words, if x 
is finite, both square roots of x are also finite. 

We shall now show that 'Vx is not a rational function by 
the method of reductio ad absurdum. Suppose it were a 
rational function. We should then have, for all values of a:. 



(1) Vi = 



/(^) 



where / (a;) and g(x~) are integral rational functions, which 
we may assume to have no common factor involving x. 
(Definition of a rational function in its lowest terms. Arts. 
135 and 137.) According to the fundamental theorem of 
Algebra (Art. 126), there exist finite values of x (real or 

248 



Am. U7] EXISTENCE OF IRKATIOXAL FUNCTIONS 249 

imagiiKii'}') wliicli satisfy the equation g(x^=0, if the func- 
tion g(^x) involves x at all. Such values of x would cause the 
right member of (1) to become infinite. But we have just 
seen that the left member of (1) remains finite for all finite 
values of x. Consequently, equation (1) gives rise to a con- 
tradiction unless (/{x^ does not involve x at all, that is, unless 
ff(x) reduces to a constant. In that case, the quotient 
f (x^lg{pc) would reduce to an integral rational function of 
a", and we should have, for all vahies of x, 

(2) V~v = a^-\- a^x + a^x9- + â€¢ â–  â€¢ + a^x"" 
or, squaring both members, 

(3) x = a^^^l a^a-^x + (a^^ + 2 a^a^^x^ 4- â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + Â«â€žV". 

But an identical equation of form (3) can hold only if the 
coefficients of like powers of x in tlie two members are equal 
to each otiier. (See Art. 126, Theorem F.) Therefore (3) 
can be true for all values of x^ only if 

= Uq^, 1 = 2 a^a^, = a^"^ -{^ 2 a^a^., etc. 

But the first and second of these equations contradict each 
other. Therefore equation (2) is impossible and Va; is not 
a rational function of x. 

We could prove, in similar fashion, that Vx^ Va^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ '\/ .r 
are not rational functions of a:, and more generally that the 
function Vx"" is not a rational function of x uidess m happens 
to be an integral multiple of n. We shall speak of all of 
these functions as irrational functions, in accordance with the 
following definition. 

A function which cannot he expressed either as an integral 
rational fwiet ion or as a quotient of tivo integral rational func- 
tions^ is called an irrational function. 

Tt would be entirely erroneous to conclude that the jDresence of a 
radical sign in the expression which defines a function is either necessary 
or sufficient to make the function irrational. Thus \/4 .r^ involves a 
radical sign, but this function is equal to Â± 2 x and is therefore rational. 



250 IRRATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 148 

On the other hand the trigonometric functions, sin x, cos x, etc., are irra- 
tional although they involve no radical signs. In applying the above 
definition we are not concerned with the form in which the function 
happens to be written. The real question is whether it is or is not 
possible to rewrite it in such a way as to make it assume the form of a 
rational function. 

148. The function y=\/x and its principal value. If a; is 

a given number, and if t/ is another number sucli that 

(1) ?/" = X, 

y is said to be an wth root of x and we write 

(2) y =</x. 

We have seen in Art. 120 that a number x has n of these nth 
roots, so that the function -s/x may be regarded as having n 
values for every value of x. It is an n-valued function. If x 
is an imaginary number none of tlie n values of Vx are real. 
If X is real, at most two of these n values are real. (See Art. 
120.) 

We shall henceforth confine our attention to the case where 
both of the variables, x and ^, in (1) are real. The discus- 
sion of this case naturally breaks up into two sub-cases 
according as n is odd or even. 

Case 1 (ji odd). If n is odd we may give to x any real 
value, positive or negative. For positive values of a;, equa- 
tion (1) has one and only one real root, and this one is 
positive. For negative values of x, equation (1) again has 
only one real root, but this time the real root is negative. 
Consequently we shall agree from now on to use the symbol 
^x in the following more precise sense. 

If n is an odd integer, and x is any real number^ the sym- 
bol Vx shall stand for the real value of the nth root of x. This 
real value of ^\rx (n being odd') is positive or negative according 
as x itself is positive or negative. 

Case 2 (w even). If n is even, negative values of x are 
not admissible if we wish to discuss only real functions of x. 



Art. 149] THE GRAPH OF // = Vx 261 

For if X is negative and n is even, there exists no real wth 
root of X. If X is positive and n is even, there are two real 
/ith roots of x^ one positive and one negative. We therefore 
make the following agreement so as to avoid all ambiguity. 

If n is an even integer, the function Vx is defined as a real 
function of x only if x is positive. Moreover, x being positive, 
the symbol ^x shall be used to stand for the positive nth root 
of X. The negative nth root of x will then be denoted by â€” ^x. 

As a result of these agreements, the function 

y = Vx 

is noiv defined as a real one-valued function for all real positive 
or negative values of x lohen n is odd, but merely for all positive 
values of x ivhen n is even. 

The one- valued function obtained in this way shall be 
called the principal value of the w-valued function defined by 
equation (1). 

149. The graph oi y = Vx. In constructing the graph of 
such a function we should remember that any two numbers, 
X and y, which satisfy the equation 

(1) y = Vx, 
also satisfy the equation 

(2) y- = x. 

Now the graph of the latter equation is most easily con- 
structed by choosing the values of y lirst and then computing 
the corresponding value of x, rather than the +y^, p, g 
other way around. Moreover, the graph of 

(2) is very closely related to the graph of 

(3) y = x\ 

In fact, from every point of the graph of (3) ^'"- *^' 

we may obtain a point on the graph of (2) by interchang- 
ing its x with its y. Now two points, P and P' (see Fig. 
60), whose coordinates are so related that the abscissa x' of 
P' is equal to the ordinate y of P, and that the ordinate 




252 IRRATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 149 

y' of P' is equal to the abscissa x of P, are symmetrically 
situated with respect to the line OB which bisects the angle 
between the positive x- and y-axes. This relation between 
P and P' is the same as that between an object and its re- 
flected image, if OB be regarded as a mirror. We shall 
therefore speak of the operation which replaces the point P 
of Fig. 60 by P' as a reflection. 

We may tlien say, that the graphs of 

(4) y = x^ and of //" = x 

are reflections of each other with respect to the bisector of the 
angle between the positive coordinate axes. 

The two functions of x defined by (4*) are said to be in- 
verse to each other, and the relation between their graphs, 
which has just been mentioned, holds for any pair of inverse 
functions. 

If in the equation 

(1) y = ^x, 

the symbol -y/x stands for the jirincipal value only of the wth 
root of a;, the graph may be 07dy a part of the graph of the 

equation 

^ y^ z= X. 

Thus the graph of 

y- = 2: 

is the whole parabola of Fig. 61, which has the 
X-axis as its axis of synnnetiy. But the graph of 
the principal value of 

y = \^x 
is merely the upper portion of this parabola, that 
portion whose points have positive ordiiiates.

Art. 1.-)0] THE FUNCTION y = Vx"' 253 

150. The function y = Vx"*. As a result of the agree- 
ments made in Art. 148 the function y/x was defined as a 
real one-valued function of the real variable x for all real 
values of x when n is odd, and for all positive values of x 
when n is even. The function 

(1) ^^(Vxr 

wliere 7ti is a positive integer will then also be defined as a 
real one- valued function of x, for all real values of x when 
)i is odd, but only for all positive values of x when w is even. 
Let us raise i/ to the nth. power. We find 

^" = [( Va?^)"]" = (a/'^)"'" = [(-v/ic)"]"' = a:"*, 
if we make use of the familiar formulas 

(Â«">)" = (a")"" = a'"", 

where m and n are positive integers.* 

Consequently, the one-valued function (1) satisfies the 
equation 

(2) ^" = a:"*. 

But this equation, which is of the nth order in y, has n 
roots (Art. 120) each of which is called an wth root of x"". 
A consistent use of the symbols would lead us to denote any 
one of these roots by Vx"'. But our desire to have this 
symbol defined unambiguously leads us to the following 
more specific definition. 

The symbol ^/x"" shall be used to stayid for that particular 
one of the nth roots of x"" ichich is equal to (\/:c)"', tvhere the 
symbol Vx is defined as a one-valued function of x by the 
agreements laid down in Art. 149. 

Thus the principal value of \'x"' is associated with the 
principal value of Vx in such a way that we shall have 

(8) V^={^xy. 

* The proof of these formulas may he reviewed by referring to Art. 157. 



254 IRRATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 151 

The choice which we have made of the principal value of 
Vx^ may also be expressed as follows. 

Whenever there exists only one real nth root of x^ {x itself 
being real), this real root is the principal value. Whenever 
there are two real nth roots of a;'", one will he positive and one 
will be negative. In that case the positive nth root of x^ is the 
principal value. 

EXERCISE LXIX

Making use of the definition of the jirincipal values of y/x and of

values of x, if n and m are both even. It is positive for all values of x. 

12. Vx"* is defined as a real one-valued function of x only for values 
of x which are positive or zero, if n is even and m is odd. For all such 
values of x the function is positive. 

13. For what values of x will the function V(2 x â€” 7)^ be defined as 
a real one-valued function ? 



14. For what values of x will the function V(7 - 2 x)^ be defined as 
a real one-valued function ? 

15. Formulate the four statements which correspond to Exs. 9, 10,

151. Properties of radicals. The following formulas are 
used very frequently in calculations involving radicals : 

(A) -v/^ = (-v^^)- (C) -^^='V^, 

(B) VV^ = "'-v/^, (D) V^Vx^=V^, 



Art. 151] PROPERTIES OF RADICALS 255 

The first of these equations has already been proved. It is 
identical with equation (3) of Art. 150. 

Let us prove equation (B). The right member of (B) is 
the principal value of the mnth root of x, and is. therefore, a 
positive number whenever x is positive. The left member 
of (B) is also an wmtli root of x. For it is easy to verify 
that the mnth power of v Va: is equal to a;. If a: is positive 
the left member of (B) will also be positive, each of the 
radical signs being used to designate the principal value of 
the corresponding root. Thus each of the two members of 
(B) is a positive mni\i root of the positive number x, con- 
sequently these two members must be equal. For, a positive 
number x has one and only one positive 7nnt\\ root, namely, 
the principal value of that root. (See Art. 120.) We have 
now proved the correctness of equation (B) for all positive 
values of x. 

If X is negative, both members of (B) will be imaginary 
unless m and n are both odd. In the latter case the prin- 
cipal values of both members of (B) will be negative. Thus, 
both members of (B) are mnth roots of the negative number 
x^ and both of them are negative. Therefore, they are equal. 
For, a negative number has only a single real mnth root and 
this is negative. (See Art. 120.) 

The remaining case when a- = requires no discussion. 
Equation (B) is obviously true \i x=0. 

Thus we see that equation (B) is actually true for all real 
values of x in all cases in which both members of (B) are 
defined as real functions. 

To prove formulas (C), (D), and (E) we may proceed as 
in proving (B). The details of the proof are left as an 
exercise for the student. 

The student may iw.ssibly have some doubt in his mind as to the 
necessity of proving these equations at all. The following- example will 
help to clarify the situation. Unless we specify that the radical signs 



256 



IRRATIONAL FUNCTIONS 



[Art. 152 



are to be used for the principal values of the indicated roots, we should 
have the alternatives 

V4 = Â± 2, V9 = Â± 3, Vm =Â±Q 

and we could not affirm that the equation 

ViV9 =V36 
is necessarily true ; it might just as well be 

ViVO = - VM. 

In all of the equations (A) . . . (E) both members are easily seen to be 
like roots of one and the same number. Since we are discussing only 
the case when the quantities concerned are real, it is evident at once 
that the two members of the equation are either equal, or else numeri- 
cally equal and opposite in sign. The essential result which we have 
obtained is this: both members of each of the equations (A) . . . (E) 
will actually be equal not only in magnitude but also in sign, whenever 
the functions concerned have real values, provided that every radical sign 
which occurs is used for the principal value of the corresponding root.

152- The square root of a rational function. When we 
iiLtcmpt to extract the square root of a ratioual function 
R{x)., two essentially different cases may present themselves. 
The square root may again be a rational function, or else 
it may not. In the former case we may say that i?(.r) is a 
perfect square. 



Akt. 152] SQUARE ROOT OF RATIONAL FUNCTION 257 

Thus the rational function 
J. (x-iy(Sx + 5r 

^ ^ (x - 3)4(x - 7)6 

is a perfect square. One of its square roots is the rational function 

.0) (X -])(:} x + 5)^ 

^'^ (X - 3)^(x - 7)3 

The other square root is this same function multiplied by â€” 1. 

This example shows quite clearly why the square roots 
of (1) are rational functions, namely, because all of the ex- 
ponents which occur in (1) are even numbers. Now an^ 
rational function may be written in what we have called its 
factored form (Art. 141), and it will obviously be a perfect 
square if all of the exponents which occur in it are even 
numbers. We may express this result as follows : 

I. If, in the factored form of a rational function, every linear 
factor of its numerator and of its denominator appears raised 
to an even power.- the function is a perfect square; that is, both 
of its square roots will be rational functions. 

Let R{x) be a rational function. Let us assume that 
RQx^ has been written in its factored form, and that not all 
of the linear factors of R(^x) which appear in this factored 
form are raised to even powers. Then each of the square 
roots of i?(a;) will be an irrational function. For let 



C'3) i/=VR(x), 

be one of these square roots, so that 
(4) f=R(ix^- 

Equation (4) shows that y cannot be a rational function. 
For if it were, i/^ in its factored form would contain only 
even exponents, contrary to the assumption that 7?(.r), in its 
factored form, contains some odd exponents. We have 
obtained the following theorem: 

IL If, in the factored form of a rational function, any of 
the factors appear raised to odd powers, both of the square roots 
of the function will be irrational. 



258 IRRATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 15.} 

Tlius, the function 

is not a perfect square because not all of the exponents are even. The 
two square roots of R(x) may be expressed as follows, 



(6) v7fw = Â±ii^iKM?Vj5l. 

This example illustrates the following general theorem. 

III. If a rational function is not a perfect square, its square 
root may he expressed as a product, one of whose factors is 
rational, while the other factor is a square root of a rational 
function with simple zeros and poles. 

The first of these factors ma}% of course, reduce to a mere constant, 
and this constant may be equal to unity. This is the case in the follow- 
ing example, 



X ~1 \x â€”i 



The expression for the square root of a rational function 
may be simplified still more. 

In the expression (6), let us multiply both terms of the fraction which 
occurs under the radical sign by x â€” 7. We find 



(x - ly 

where we now' have an integral rational function with distinct linear 
factors under the radical sign. The corresponding general theorem is 
as follows : 

IV. If a rational function is not a perfect square, its square 
root may he expressed as a product, one of tvhose factors is 
rational, while the other is a square root of an integral rational 
function without repeated factors. 

153. Functions which involve the square root of a rational 
function and no other irrationality. Let R(x) he a rational 
function which is not a perfect square, so that -\/ R(x) is 



Art. 153] SQUARE ROOT AS ONLY IRRATIONALITY 259 

irrational. Consider a function / {x} which is made up of 
a sum of terms of the form 



(1) A,Cx}, A,ix)^E{x), ^2(a.)(Vi2(a;))2, 

^3(x)(V;ft(^)3, etc., 
where ^o(^)' -^i(-'')^ ^2(-*')' ^^^â€¢' ^^Â® rational functions of x. 



Since (V7^0r))2 = 7e(:r), (Vi2(a;))3 = i2(2;)Vi2(a:), etc., 

each of these terms will be either a rational function, or else 
a product of a rational function times ^I{{x). Conse- 
quently the sum of all of these terms will be an expression 
of the form 



(2) rational function -f another rational funetion x V^(2;}. 

If R(x^ is not an integral rational function without repeated 
factors, we may, as in Art. 152, express ^R(x^ in the form 
of a rational function times ^r{x) where r(x') is an integral 
rational function without repeated factors, so that Vr(2;) is 
irrational. 

Thus, the sum of any number of terms of the form (1) 
may finally be written in the form 



(3) /(x) = A(x) + B(^x)Vr(ix% 

where A{x') and B(^x') are rational functions of x, and where 
r{x) is an integral rational function without repeated factors. 
Suppose we have a second function ,g{x^ of the same kind 
as /(a;). It may then be written in the form 



(4) g{x) = Cix) + I)(x) Vr(2:), 

where C(x^ and -Z)(x) are rational functions. 

The quotient of two such functions ma}^ again be reduced 
to the same form. To prove this we write 

A + B^/r A + B^r C-BVr 



(5) 



C+BVr C+D^r C - D^r

where C^ â€” I>h' will not be identically equal to zero. For, 
if it were, we should have 

_ (72 

contrary to our assumption that Vr(a^) is irrational. We 
may rewrite (5) in the form 

where L(x) and M(x^ are rational functions. 

Thus, ever// function of x, which depends upon the square 
root of a rational function in the way indicated, may he re- 
tvritten in the form 



(6) L (a-) + M(x:) Vr{x) 

where L{x^ and M(pc) are rational functions arid where r(a-) 
is an integral rational function with no repeated factors. 

We may speak of (6) as the normal form of such a func- 
tion. The process used in (5) for reducing an irrational 
function of this kind to the normal form is frequently known 
as rationalizing the denominator. 

If a function contains more than one independent square 
root, the normal form may be obtained by rationalizing first 
with respect to one of the square roots, then with respect to 
the second, and so on.

154. Irrational equations of the simplest type. Let f(x) 
be an irrational function of x. Tiiis function may assume 
the value zero for one or several particular values of x. 



Akt. 1:)4] simplest IRRATIONAL EQUATIONS 261 

These values of .r, if they exist, are called the zeros of f(j-), 
or the roots of the irrational equation 

(1) /(â€¢r) = 0. 

Let us confine our attention to the case where the function 
/â– (.r) contains as its only irrationality the square root of a 
single rational function. We have just shown (in Art. 153) 
that we may then write /(i-) in the form 



/(.r) = i(r) + i>f(.r)Vr(^.i') 

wheic L(x) and 3I(x) are rational functions, and where 
r(a-) is an integral rational function with no repeated factor. 
Consequently equation (1) will assume the form 



(2) L(^x)+ M(x)Vr{x) = 
or 

(3) L(x)=- 71if(x)Vr(a-). 

If i- is a root of (3), it will also satisfy the equation 

(4) [X(.0]^ = [iÂ»f(.r)]V(.r), 

obtained from (3) by sc^uaring both members, and (4) is a 
rational equation which may be solved by tlie methods of 
Art. 145. If we remember what those metliods were, we 
shall recognize the truth of the following statement : 

The problem of solving an irrational equation of form (2) 
77iai/ he reduced to the problem of solving a certain integral 
rational equation in .r. 

But Avhile it is certain that all solutions of (2) will also be 
solutions of tlie rational equation (4), it is not at all certain 
that every solution of (4) will be a solution of (2). 

//â–  thr si/i)i/iol \/r(.r) stands for the principal value <f the

the (â– (|nati(.)n

(5) X(.r) - If (.r) V/<^ = 0, 

as well, will satisfy equation (4). Moreover, since from (4) 
we may conclude 

L(^x) = Â± M(x}-Vr{x), 

it is clear that the roots of (4) will be distributed among the 
two equations (2) and (5). It may happen that one of the 
equations (2) or (5) has no roots at all. 

These remarks justify the following conclusion : The solu- 
tion of an irrational equation which involves a square root of a 
rational function of the unknown quantity/ and no other irra- 
tionality may he reduced to the solution of an integral rational 
equation. But in general the latter equation will not he equiv- 
alent to the origirial equation^ and each of its roots should he 
tested before announcing it as a root of the original irrational 
equation. 

Similar remarks may be made about irrational equations 
of a more complicated kind, but it would be unprofitable to 
discuss such cases here.

155. The general algebraic function. All of the functions, 
rational as well as irrational, which we have considered so 
far, belong to the class of algebraic functions, which may be 
defined as follows : 

Let -4(a-), B(x)., â€¢â€¢â€¢, i(a;), M(x^ he rational functions of x. 
The equation 

(1) A^xyy" 4- ^(a;)2/"-i -}-â€¢â€¢â€¢+ L(^x)y + M(x) = 



Art. 155] THE GENERAL ALCIEBRATC FUNCTION 263 

determines y as an n-valued function of x, since according to 
the funda^nental theorem of Algebra^ for any given value of x 
the equation (1) will have n roots. 

Any function of x which, when substituted for y, will 
satisfy an equation of the form (1 ), witli rational functions 
as coefficients, is called an algebraic function. All other 
functions are called transcendental. 

Any function, which is built up from a finite number of 
rational functions by means of operations involving a finite 
number of radical signs, is an algebraic function in the sense 
of the above definition. 



y = X + vx- + y/x 

is an algebraic f auction. For we can easily find an equation of form (1) 
which this function will satisfy. We have 

(// â€” x)^ = x- + Vx 
and therefore 

This eqviation when expanded is of the form (1), its degree being 
n = 6. 

But not every algebraic function can be expressed in 
terms of a finite number of rational operations and extrac- 
tion of roots. We know, for instance, that the general 
equation of the fifth degree cannot be solved by means of 
such operations. (See Art. 125.) Consequently, the func- 
tions defined by means of an equation of the fifth degree in 
y, with rational functions of x as coefficients, cannot always 
be expressed by means of a finite number of radical signs, 
although these functions are algebraic according to our defi- 
nition. 

For this reason, algebraic functions are frequently divided 
into two classes. Those which can be expressed in terms 
of a finite number of radical signs are called explicit alge- 
braic functions, to distinguish them from the more general 
algebraic functions which cannot be expressed in this way. 

The general theory of algebraic functions is a very impor- 



264 IRRATIONAL FUNCTIONS [Art. 155 

tant and interesting field of study. The student will have 
the opportunity of becoming acquainted with some of the 
simpler cases of algebraic functions in his course in analytic 
geometry, and he is already in possession of all of the pre- 
liminaries that will enable him to pursue this study to 
advantage. The general theory, however, is a far more 
difficult subject, and its discussion must be postponed to a 
much later point in the student's mathematical career. This 
general theory is essentially a product of the nineteenth 
century and is due principally to Cauchy (1789-1857), 
Abel (1802-1829), Jacobi (1804-1851), Riemann (1826- 
186G), Weierstrass (1815-1897). 



CHAPTER VTII 

FRACTIONAL AND NEGATIVE EXPONENTS 

THE GENERAL PO"WER FUNCTION 

THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION AND LOGARITHMS 

156. Fractional, negative, and vanishing exponents. Tlie 
Â«tudejit knoAvs, from las first course in Algebra, that the 
function ^x^ is frequently written with a different notation, 
namely, 

(1) V^ = :f-'S 

and the symbols 7^ and a;"" are often interpreted in accord- 
ance with the equations 

(2) a;0 = 1, x-^ = \' 

The reasons, which have led to the adoption of these no- 
tations are of so much interest that we shall treat the matter 
as thouo-h we were now meetino" it for the first time. 

157. The index laws. If m is a positive integer^ the symbol 
.?â– '" is used to de)iote a product of m factors, each of which is 
equal to X. This definition of the symbt)l ./'" may be ex- 
pressed as follows : 

(1) x^ = x-x-X"-x (a product of m c(|ual factors, m 
being a positive integer). From this dcliiiilion tlic follow- 
ing theorems follow at once : 

I. X'" â€¢ .r'^ = .r'""^" (m and n being positive integers). 

II. (./â€¢'")" = .^â€¢""' (w and n being positive integers). 

III. ^=x"'~" (m and n being positive integers, and 

X" 

m > 71 ). 

Formulas I, II, III are usually known as the index laws. 
The definition (1) of x"" is entirely devoid of meaning 

265 



266 THE GEXERAL POWER FUNCTION [Akt. 157 

unless m is a positive integer. For, in this definition, m 
stands for the number of factors in a certain product, and it 
is absurd to speak of a product composed of a fractional num- 
ber of factors, a negative number of factors, or no factor 
at all. Consequently the definition (1) cannot be used in 
any case in which m is not a positive integer. 

Thus, if we wish to give a meaning to the symbol a;'" when 
m is not a positive integer, we must seek a new delinition 
essentially different from (1). Now, as a mere matter of 
logic, rue have the right to define the symbols of algebra i)t any 
way we may desire. Thus we might, for instance, define 
the symbol x'^ in such a way as to make it stand for x/2, for 
2/x, for Va;, or for anything else we please, and nobody 
would have a right to object to any of these definitions on 
the score of logic. But one might very properly object to 
some of these definitions on account of their inconvenience. 

In order to obtain a definition for x"^ which shall not only 
be logically admissible, but which shall also be convenient 
and useful, we argue as follows. Nothing compels us to 
introduce such a symbol as a;^ at all. The very fact that 
this symbol resembles the familiar symbols a-^, x^, x^, etc., so 
much, makes it inconvenient to introduce it at all unless it 
can be done in such a way as to enable us to perform calcu- 
lations with this new symbol according to the same rules 
(the index laws) which hold for x^, x^, a:^ etc. Thus, our 
desire for a convenient definition leads to the following ques- 
tion : Is it possible to define the symbol x^ in such a way that 
the index laws /, /i, and III may he used m all of the calcula- 
tions in which this new symbol occurs? 

This question is easy to answer. If it is possible to define 
x^ in such a way, we may apply index law II to it, for the 
purpose of computing its square, giving 
(a;2-^2 _ ^2 _ ^^ 

Therefore, the symbol x'^ must be taken to mean one of the 
two square roots of x.* If x is positive, one of its two square 

* Since its square is equal to x. 



Ain. 157] THE INDEX LAWS 2G7 

roots is positive and the otlier is negative. We therefore 
define x^ as the positive square root of x, whenever a: is a 
positive number. If x is negative, the two square roots 
of X are both imaginary and either one of them may be 

identified with the symbol x-. 

1 

In the same way we are led to define a" bi/ means of the 

equation 

1 _ 

(2) x^ = ^/x, 

the principal value of the nth root of x being meant when x is 
real. 

(See Art. 148 for definition of principal value.) 
According to the second index law, we shall have 

1 m 

(^xy = (x"y' = x\ 

m 

thus leading to a definition for x'\ namely., 

m _ 

(3) x"=(Vxy=Vx'\ 

where the second and tliird members are equal on account 
of (3), Art. 150. 

We observe that the third index law 

(4) â€” = a;--" 
^ x^ 

was subject to the restriction m > n. If ni is less than n or 
equal to w, the exponent in the right member becomes nega- 
tive or zero. If we wish to introduce negative or vanishing 
exponents in such a way as to preserve the validity of the 
index laws, we must therefore do so in accordance with what 
equation (4) tells us. But if we put w = w in (4) we find 
the following definition of .r^ : 

(5) ^ = ?- = l. 



268 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Aim. 1.> 

If m is less than /Â«, let it be equal to nâ€”k. If we put 
m = n â€” k in (4) we find 



X

-k 

^nâ€”k â€” n /yÂ» â€” k 



But the left member of this equation is actually equal to 
l/a:^ thus leading us to write 

(6) x-^ = \ 

x" 

as the definition of x~^. Combining (3) and (6), we have 

-â„¢ 1 1 



JU â€” ,,â€ž 



x^ 

We have now defined the s3'mbol x^ in all cases in which 
r is either a positive or negative integer or zero, or a positive 
or negative rational fraction. We know that no other defi- 
nitions than those actually adopted were possible, if the in- 
dex laws were to be satisfied. But we are not yet absolutely 
certain that all of the index laws will actually be satisfied by 
these symbols in all cases. For we have only used one of 
these laws for the purpose of guiding us toward the appro- 
priate definition in each case. It is possible, however, to 
verify, by actual test, that the powers with fractional, 7iegative, 
and vanishing exponents defined in this wa// actually obey all 
of the index laws. We may therefore operate with them ac- 
cording to the same rules which hold for positive integral ex- 
ponents. It is this fact which makes tliese definitions, not 
merely logically admissible, but extremely convenient and 
useful. 

158. The principle of permanence. The j)oint of view 
which guided us in fornndating these definitions is known 
as the priyiciple of the permanence of theforvnal latvs of algebra. 
This same principle aided us in Chapter I, when we were 
engaged in enlarging the number system of algebra, ])y add- 
ing to the system of all positive integers the negative, frac- 
tional, irrational, and complex numbers. The principle of 



Art. 158] THE PRINCIPLE OF PERMANENCE 269 

permanence is not a principle of logic. It is a heuristic 
principle which leads us to new definitions and notions, 
enabling us to obtain results which are, not merely logically 
admissible, but simple and convenient. Its main object is 
to make a few formal laws (formulas) suffice where other- 
wise there would be many. It accomplishes this purpose 
by making a formula which is already in existence do more 
work than was originally intended for it, thus preventing 
the introduction of a new formula. 

Thus, in the present instance, the index hiws were originally intended 
to apply only to powers with positive integral exponents. The principle 
of permanence has led us to adopt such definitions as to make the index 
laws accomplish very much raoi-e. They now apply to powers with 
negative and fractional exponents as well.

270 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 159 

159. The case of an irrational exponent. If the exponent 
k is an irrational number, the symbol x'' is as yet undefined. 
To define x'^ in this case also, we proceed as follows. 

We know that any irrational number k can be expressed 
with any desired degree of approximation by a decimal. 
(See Art. 77.) Let k^ be a number written in the decimal 
notation, with n figures to the right of the decimal point, 
such that kn is less than k but differs from k by less than one 
unit of the nt\\ decimal place. Let kj be the number ob- 
tained from kn by increasing the digit in the nth. decimal 
place by one unit. Then 

As n (the number of decimal places) grows beyond bound, 
the rational numbers k^ and kj both approach k as a limit. 
It can be shown that the numbers 

/j-JCl /yiA2 /y"3 , , 

/yÂ»n'l /yt^^'l ry^.i 

JU * â€¢</ ^ â€¢c- ^ " * 

will also approach a common limit. We define xf' to he this limit. 

It can further be shown (here again the monotonic laws 
turn out to be important), that the index laivs will continue 
to hold even if some or all of the exponents involved are irratiotial. 

It is not difficult to prove that the function x'' is a tran- 
scendental function (see Art. 155) if k is an irrational 
number. This fact indicates how delicate the distinction 
between algebraic and transcendental functions may some- 
times be. All of the functions x^\ x''\ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ , x^ â–  â€¢ â€¢ indicated 
in the above argument are algebraic and the exponent k^ of 
^u (liffers from k by less than one unit of the nth. decimal 
place. Nevertheless a/'Â» is algebraic and x^ is transcendental. 

We know that V2 is irrational. The numbers denoted above by 
ki, ki, etc., will, in this instance, be as follows : 

/. _ 1 4 _ 14 7- _ 1 41 _ 141 7. _ 1 414 _ 1414 etc 

The functions 

14 14 1 J.4 14 

a;i^ a;'*^, a;iÂ»Â«<^, etc., 
are all algebraic, but the function x^ is transcendental. 



Art. 160] THE POWER FUNCTION 271 

160. The power function. We have now defined the 
function 

(1) ?/=a:*= 

for all cases in which the exponent ^ is a real number. This 
function, which we shall call a power function, reduces to 
some very familiar functions if we give special values to the 
exponent k. Thus for A; = 1, we find the simple linear func- 
tion ^ = a; whose graph is a straight line (see Art. 51); for 
^ = 2 we find the simple quadratic function y = x^ whose 
graph is a parabola (see Art. 65). Whenever Ar is a positive 
integer x^ is an integral rational function of x (see Art. 82). 
If ^ = 0, x^ z=x^ = 1, so that the graph of (1) in this case is a 
line parallel to the a;-axis at a distance of one unit above 
it. If A; = â€” 1, (1) becomes 

_i 1 

y=X 1 = -, 
X 

whose graph (an equilateral hyperbola) we studied in Art. 
140. Whenever A; is a negative integer, y = x^ is a rational 
function which has a; = as a pole (see Art. 139), and there- 
fore becomes infinite as x approaches zero. 

If ^ is a positive rational number, so that Iz = mjn where m 
and n are positive integers, we have 



y 



= 2:*= = .r " = Va 



according to Art. 157, and we have studied such functions 
and their graphs in Art. 150. From what was said at the 
end of Art. 159 it is clear that the graph of the function 
y = a;^ if yfc is a positive irrational number, may be regarded 
as approximately the same as that of a function of the form 
^m/n ^yi^i-^ r^ rational exponent, provided that the exponent 
m/n is a sufficiently close approximation to k. 

Thus, tlie graph of // = x^- is approximately the same as tliat of 

141 

y =z x^^^, since V2 is approximately equal to | J^. 



272 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 160 

If ^ is a negative rational number, so that 

n 
where m and n are positive integers, we have 

m "j 

y = x'^ = x'n = ' , (See Art. 157) 

a function which becomes infinite for x = 0. These func- 
tions may also be regarded as approximate expressions for 
the case where Z; is a negative irrational number. 

Thus the function x-^'^ is approximately equal to x ^^^, or 
1 1 



We shall now generalize our definition of power function 
slightly, as follows : 

Any function of the form ax^^ where a atid k are constants, 
shall be called a poiver function. 

Power functions have an important property, which is 
common to all of them, and which we shall now deduce. 

Let Xj, OTg, a^3, â€¢â€¢â€¢ be several values of x and let Â«/j, y^-, yy> â€¢â€¢â€¢ 
be the corresponding values of y. Then we shall have 

Vx ^^ ax-^ , 7/2 ^ ax2 , y^ = ax^ â€¢â€¢â€¢, 
whence 

(2) ^2 = -V = (-hy^ !h ^ ffsY, etc. 

If the values x^, x^-, 3*3, â€¢â€¢â€¢ form a geometric progression 
whose ratio is r, we hiive 



= r 



and therefore, according to (2). 
^ = ^= ...^rK 



AuT. 160] TUE POWER FUNCTION 273 

In other words, ?/j, i/^^ 3/3, â€¢â€¢â€¢ will also form a geometric 
progression, whose constant ratio r* is, of course, in general 
different from r. 

We obtain the following theorem which expresses the 
essential property common to all power functions : 

Let y he a pou'er function of a-, and let us take any number 
of values of x which form a geometric progression. The cor- 
responding values of y ivill then also form a geometric pro- 
gression. 

This may also be expressed as follows : In a power func- 
tion., to values of the independent variable which form a 
geometric progression, there correspond values of the function 
which likewise form a geometric progrei<sion. 

This theorem enables us to recognize a power function when a large 
number of pairs of values of x and y are given numerically, as a result 
of experiment and measurement, and we may then actually find a 
formula for the relation between x and y, expressing y as a power 
function of x. 

There is an important distinction between power functions 
according as their exponents are positive or negative, a dis- 
tinction which has already appeared implicitly in the dis- 
cussion at the beginning of this article. 

A potver function y = ax'' for which the exponent k is positive 
asnimes the value zero tvhen x becomes equal to zero. But a 
power function whose exponent is negative becomes infinite when 
X approaches zero. 

Therefore, the graph of a power function with a positive 
exponent passes thi-ough the origin while the graph of a 
power function with a negative exponent does not pass 
through the origin. 

The two functions >j = x^, and y = ar-i = - will illustrate this state- 

X 

ment. 



274 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Akts. 161, 162 

161. The exponential function. Up to the present moment 
we have always thought of the exponent in the equation 

(1) y = x>' 

as a constant, and the base as variable. We now propose to 
think of the base as a constant and the exponent as variable; 
that is, we propose to study the expression (1) as a function 
of the exponent. We shall indicate tliis new point of view 
by a change of notation, writing a for the fixed base, and x 
for the variable exponent, so that (1) becomes 

(2) y = a-. 

After the base a has been chosen, the value of a^ will 
depend only upon x, so that a"" is a function of x. It is 
called an exponential function. 

We shall eo7isider only the exponential functions whose bases 
are positive numbers different from unity. The reasons for 
these restrictions are fairly obvious. If the base a were 
negative, a^ would not be real if x were equal to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 
or any fraction with an even denominator. If the base were 
equal to unity, a^ would be equal to 1^ and this would be 
equal to 1 for all values of x. 

We agree., moreover., when a is positive and when the exponent 
x is a fraction m/n, that a^ shall always be defined as the prin- 
cijyal value of 

a'' = Vaâ„¢, 

quite in accordance with what ivas said in Art. 157. 

In most applications, the base a is, moreover, taken to be 
greater than unity. However, this is not at all essential. 

162. Graphs of exponential functions. The method of 
constructing the graph of an exponential function needs no 
detailed explanation. It is precisely the same as for all of 
the other functions which we have studied so far.

163. Properties of a'^. The graphs obtained in the pre- 
ceding exercise indicate several properties of the exponen- 
tial function by mere inspection. In the first place, all of 
these graphs are continuous, unbroken curves. To this fact 
corresponds the following theorem. 

I. The exponential function is continuous for all fiiiite 
values of x. 

AVe shall not attempt to give a formal proof of this theorem. 

In the second place, we observe that all of the exponen- 
tial curves are situated entirely ahove the .r-axis. This is a 
consequence of the following theorem, which follows at once 
from the definition of a^. 

II. The function a^ loith a positive base a, is positive for all 
values of x. 

3Iore specifically ; if a > 1, then a"" > 1 for x > 0, and 
rt^ < 1 for X <0; if a < 1, then a-" < 1 for x > 0, a7id a'^ > 1 
or X < 0. 

Let us draw a line parallel to the ^--axis and above it. 
The graphs, which we have constructed, indicate that such 
a line will intersect the curve in one and only one point. 



276 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 163 

This remark suggests the following theorem which we shall 
not attempt to prove except in this intuitive fashion. 

III. If y is any positive number^ there exists one and only 
one real number x^ such that a^ = y. 

We observe further, if we draw all of the graphs on the 
same sheet and referred to the same axes, that they all pass 
through the point a;= 0, ^ = 1. This is due to the follow- 
ing fact (see Art. 157) : 

IV. For any base Â«, we have a^ = 1. 

It is clear, botli from the graphs and otherwise, that a' 
grows beyond bound when x grows beyond bound in the 
positive direction ; but that a^ approaches zero as a limit 
when X grows beyond bound in the negative direction, pro- 
vided that the base a is greater than unity. These facts 
may be summarized as follows : 

V. If a y 1, a^ increases as x increases^ and lim a^= +od. 

VI. If a > 1, a"" decreases as x decreases^ and lim a^= 0. 

The following properties are not quite so evident from the 
graph, but follow immediately from the definition of a^ and 
the index laws, 

VII. a^ â€¢ ay = a""*"^, the addition formula for the exponential 
function. 

VIII. â€” = Â«^~'', the subtraction formula for the exponential 

a" 

function. 

IX. (a^)" = a^^, the multiplication formula for the exponen- 
tial fuyiction. 

The division formula (a-^)i''^ = a-^''-" 

may be regarded as being contained in IX, since y in IX may 
be a fraction, and need not be listed separately. Similarly 
VIII may be regarded as a consequence of VII, since y in 
VII may be positive or negative. However, VIII has so 
many important applications as to justify an explicit state- 
ment. 



Art. 164] DEFINITION OF LOGARITHM 277 

X. If the numbers^ .r^, x,^^ x^, and so on, form an arithmetic 
progression, the corresponding exponentials a^\ a""", a'3, and so 
on, form a geometric progression. 

This follows from VII and the definitions of arithmetic 
and geometric progressions (Arts. 56 and 59). 

As a consequence of X, the theory of geometric progressions may be 
connected with the following question : what values does an exponential 
function ar' assume when x assumes in succession the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 
and so on? In just this way the theory of arithmetic progressions was 
connected with the question : what are the values of the linear function 
clx + a for X = 0, 1, 2, 8, and so on? (See Art. 56.)

164. Definition of logarithm. If rt^ is a positive base differ- 
ent from unity wq know, according to Theorem III, Art. 163, 
that there exists a real exponent x such that 

(1) a-=y, 

where y is any given positive number. This exponent x is 
called the logarithm of y with respect to the base a, a relation 
which is expressed in symbols as follows : 

(2) .r = logâ€žy. 

Thus, the logarithm of a positive ^lumber y, ivith respect to a 
given base a, is the exponent of the poiver to -which the base a 
must be raised in order to obtain the number y. 

It should be noted that we have defined the logarithms of posifive 
numbers only. The question whether negative numbers have any loga- 
rithms need not be discussed here. In the theory of functions, however. 
logaritlimsof negative numbers are actually defined ; but these logarithms 
of negative numbers are imaginary.

(1) y = a^ and x = \og^y 

represent the same relation between x and y, merely written 
in a different form, just as is the case with the relations 

y =z aP' and X = Â± V,y- 

In other words, the two functions Â«=" and logâ€ž?/, which are 
inverses of each other (see Art. 149), have the same graph.

166. Properties of logarithms. The properties of loga- 
rithms follow at once from those of the exponential function, 
and from inspection of the graphs. The most important ones 
are as follows: 

I. If a is a jjositive number different from unity, the function 
log^x is defined for all 2)ositive values of x, butnotfor x = nor 
for negative values of x. It is a continuous function for all 
positive values ofx. 

II. If the base a is greater than unity, we have log^x < for 
< a; < 1, log^x > for x > 1. 

III. The logarithm of unity with respect to any base is zero^ 
that is 

log^ 1 = 0, since a^ =1. 

IV. The logarithm of any number with respect to itself as 
base is unity, that is, 

log a a = 1, since a^ = a. 

V. Jf a > 1, then lim log^x = + oo . 



280 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 166 

This is meielj' a re-statement of V, Art. 16o. For if y = logaX, we 
have aÂ« = x and, according to V, Art. 163, x will become infinite as y 
grows beyond bound. This property is sometimes expressed by the 
symbolic equation 

logo CO = CO . 

VI. 7^ a > 1, then Urn logaX= â€” co . Thus log^x is not 

continuous in the neighborhood of .r = 0, 

This is merely a re-statement of VI, Art. 163. For, if // = logo a;, we 
have ay = X and, according to YI, Art. 163, x will approach zero as its 
limit when y grows beyond bound through a sequence of negative num- 
bers. This property is sometimes expressed symbolically as follows : 

logo = - CO . 

VII. The logarithm of a product is equal to the sum of the 
logarithms of the factors. 

Proof. Let M and N be two jjositive numbers, and let x and y be 
their logarithms, so that 

X = logo M, y = loga N, 
or 

M = a^, N = nv. 
We then have 

MN = (fay = a^+y, (Theorem VII, Art. 163) 

or, making use of the definition of logarithms, 

logo {MN) = z + ?/ = logo M + logo iV, 

and this equation proves the theorem. 

VIII. The logarithm of a quotient is equal to the logarithm 
of the dividend minus the logarithyn of the divisor. 

Proof. Using the same notations as in the proof of VII, we find 



and therefore 



^ = c^-y, 

N 



logo^ =x- y = logo M - log N, 



which was to be proved. 

IX. The logarithm of the jo"' power of a number M is ob- 
tained by mnltiplging the logarithm of M by p. 



Art. 107] COMMON LOGARITHMS 281

sion^ their logarithms will be in aritlimetric progression.

tion of an arithmetic and a geometric progression. 

Compare this theorem with theorem X of Art. 163 and with the 
fundamental property given in Art. 160 of the power function.

5. What functions are those which have the following property? If 
the argument x takes on a sequence of values which are in arithmetic 
[>rogres8ion, the corre.sponding values of the function will also be in 
arithmetic progression. 

167. Common logarithms. With scarcely an exception, 
the civilized nations ol' all times have made use of the deci- 
mal system for expressing numbers, both in the spoken and 
in the written language.* For this reason, the number 10 is 
especially well adapted to serve as base for a system of loga- 

* It is usually admitted that the prednminance of the decimal system over all 
others is due to the fact that the normal hmnaii btiiii; has ten finders. Tliis 
opinion has certainly been generally held since the time of Aristotle. 



282 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 168, 169 

rithms. Logarithms with respect to the base 10 are usually 
known as common logarithms ; they are also sometimes called 
Briggsian logarithms, in honor of Henry Briggs* (1556- 
1630), who constructed the first table of common logarithms. 
For purposes of numerical calculation, common logarithms 
are by far the most convenient. We reproduce in tlie ap- 
pendix a four-place table of common logarithms, whose use 
we shall now explain. 

Articles 168-177 may be omitted by students who have studied trigo- 
nometry, or postponed until they take up ti'igonometry. 

168. Characteristic and mantissa. The positive integral powers 

of 10, sucii as 10, 100, 1000, etc., the negative integral jaowers of 10, such 
as 0.1, 0.01, 0, 0.001, etc., and the zero power of 10, which is equal to 1, 
are the only numbers whose common logarithms are integers. The loga- 
rithms of all other numbers have an integral and a fractional part. 

The fractional part of the logarithm is called the mantissa, ivhile the 
integral pa7-t of the logarithm is known as its characteristic. 

169. Properties of the mantissa. We consider the mantissa and 
the characteristic separately because, in practice, the method of finding 
the characteristic of a logarithm is entirely different from that employed 
for finding its mantissa. The reason for this will appear from the 
following discussion. 

Let us grant that we have found out in some way 

(1) log 1.7783 = 0.2500. 

From the theorem about the logarithm of a product, we conclude 

log 17.783 = log (1.7783 x 10)= log 1.7783 + log 10 = 0.2500 + 1 

= 1.2500, 
log 177.83 = log (1.7783 x 100) = log 1.7783 + log 100 = 0.2500 + 2 

= 2.2500, 

We observe that the numbers 1.7783, 17.783, 177.83, etc., contain the 
same succession of digits, and differ from each other only in the position 
of the decimal point. Their logarithms, on the other hand, whose 
values we have just calculated, differ from each other only in the value 
of the characteristic. 

* Briggs was the first Savilian Professor of geometry at Oxford. According 
to Ball (see Ball's Primer of the Historij of Mathematics). Briggs was also the 
first to make systematic use of the decimal notation iu working with fractions. 



Art. 170] DETERMINATION OF THE CHARACTERISTIC 283 

Again, if we make use of the theorem about the logarithm of a quo- 
tient, we find from (1) 

log 0.17783 = logiâ€”^ = 0.2500 - 1, 
log 0.017783 = log ^-^^ = 0-2500 - 2, 



Now, the negative quantities, whicli appear in the right members of 
these equations, are not written in the form wliich we ordinarily use for 
negative quantities. Thus, for instance, we have found the value of 
log 0.017783 to be 0.2500 â€” 2, a result which we should ordinai-ily write 
in the form â€” 1.7500 to which it is obviously equal. If we agree to 
write every negative logarithm in this unusual form, as a difference 
between a positive proper fraction and an integer, thus making its frac- 
tional part positive, we gain the advantage that the mantissa will be 
the same for any two numbers which contain the same succession of 
digits, even if none of these digits appear to the left of the decimal 
point. We avoid, in this way, the necessity of using two different 
tables of mantissas, one for numbers greater than unity and one for num- 
bers less than unity. 

Let us recapitulate the result of our discussion in two formal 
statements. 

I. We agree to express the logarithm of any positive number N in such a 
form that its mantissa shall be positive. 

This can be done w'hether log N is positive or negative, that is, 
whether N be greater or less than unity. In the latter case, the nega- 
tiveness of log iV is brought about entirely by means of the negative 
characteristic. 

As a consequence of this agreement, the following statement will be 
true in all cases. 

II. If two numbers contain the same succession of digits, that is, if they 
differ only in the position of the decimal point, their logarithms will hare the 
same mantissa and icill differ only in the value of the characteristic. 

It is for this reason that the tables give only the mantissas of the 
logarithms and that, in looking up the mantissas, we pay no attention to 
the position of the decimal point in the given number. 

170. Determination of the characteristic. The characteristic 

of a logarithm is easily determined by inspection. Its value depends 
merely on the position of the decimal point. Since we have 

10"= 1, 101 _ 10, 102 ^ 100, 103 = 1000, etc., 
or log 1=0, log 10 = 1, log 100 = 2, log 1000 = 3, etc., 

we draw the followino- conclusions : 



284 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Akt. 170 

If 1 < .V< 10, then < log iV< 1. .-. log N has the characteristic 0. 

If 10<iV<100, then 1 < log N<2. .-. log N has the character- 
istic 1. 

If 100<i\^< 1000, then 2 <logiV<3. .-. log N has the character- 
istic 2. 



If 10*< A^< 10*+i, then A< log N < k + 1. .-. log N has the char- 
acteristic k. 

We may fornmlate these results as follows: 

I. If k is a positire integer, and if the numher N lies between 10* and 
10*"^S the characteristic of log N is equal to k. 

Since such a number N has k -\- 1 digits to the left of the decimal 
point, we obtain the following rule : 

II. If N is any number greater than 1, the characteristic of its logarithm 
is one less than the number of digits in its integral part. 

The student is advised to make but little use of this rule on account 
of its mechanical character. Statement I provides a better method 
(less mechanical and easier to remember) for determining the charac- 
teristic. 

It remains to show how to find the characteristic of log iVwheu iV< 1. 

If .l<iV<l, then -l<logiV<0. .-. logN has the character- 
istic â€” 1, since the mantissa is positive. 

If .01<A''<.1, then - 2<log7V^<- 1. .-. log N has the charac- 
teristic â€” 2. 

If .001 <N < .01, then - 3 < log N < - 2. .-. log TV has the charac- 
teristic â€” 3. 



If Y7is< ^ ^ To"*' *'^^" ~ ^^ + ^)< log ^^<- k. .-. log N has the 
characteristic â€” (^- + 1). 

Examination of this table leads to the following two statements, 
either of which may be used to determine the characteristic of log N 
when iV< 1. 



Ifk is a positire integer, and if the number N lies between â–  â€” and 



1 



the characteristic of log N is â€” (k + 1). 

If N is less than 1, and is expressed as a decimal fraction having k zeros 
between the decimal point and the frst significant figure, then the characteris- 
tic of the logarithm of N is â€”{k-\- 1 ) . 

In one of our illustrations we had found 

log 0.01783 = 0.2."j0O - 2. 



AuT. 171] USE OF TABLE OF LOGARITHMS 285 

We must never write this in the form 

log 0.01783 = - 2.2500, 

since only the characteristic is negative and not the fractional part. 
Some computers use the notation 

log 0.01783 = 2.2500 ; 

but for most purposes it is preferable to write 

log 0.01783 = 8.2500 - 10, 
and similarly 

log 0.1783 = 9.2500 - 10. 

In other words, in actual practice, ice write a positive characteristic 
10 â€” k in place of the negative characteristic â€” k, and then subtract \0 from 
the whole logarithm. 

171. Arrangement and use of the table of logarithms. We 

have already mentioned the fact that the table of logarithms gives only 
the mantissas. The characteristics must be supplied by the computer 
by the methods of Art. 170. 

The Table in the Appendix gives the mantissa for every number from 
1 to 999, to four decimal places. In order to explain the arrangement 
and use of this table, we shall now solve a number of typical examples. 

Problem 1. Find the logarithm of 22.1. 

Solution. To find the mantissa we ignore the decimal point. We 
read down the left-hand column of the table (headed N) until we fii.d 
the fiist two digits of our number, viz. : 22. The numbers printed in the 
same horizontal row with 22 are, in order, the mantissas of the logarithms 
of 220, 221, 222, â€¢â€¢â€¢, 229, as indicated by the number at the head of 
each of the next ten columns. In our case we find the mantissa, from 
the column headed 1, to be .3444. Since 22.1 is between 10 = 10' and 
100 = 10-, tlie characteristic is 1. Therefore 

log 22.1 = 1.3444. 

If the number N contains more than three digits its logarithm cannot 
be read directly from the table. But it may be found by interpolation. 
We illustrate this process by an example. 

Problem 2. Find the log 222.7. 

Solution. From the table we find, sujiplying the characteristics our- 
selves, 

log 222 = 2.3464 
log 223 = 2.3483 



286 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 171 

Tabular difference = 0.0019 = 19 units of the fourth decimal place. 
Since 222.7 is ^^ of the way from 222 toward 223 we add ^^ of the tabu- 
lar difference to log 222. Therefore 

log 222.7 = 2.3464 + ^V of 0.0019, 
or log 222.7 = 2.8464 + 0.0013 = 2.3477. 

It remains to show how to find the number when its logarithm is 
given . 

Problem 3. Given log iV = 9.3489 - 10. Find the value of N to 
four significant figures. 

Solution. The characteristic of log iV is 9 â€” 10 or â€” 1. Therefore, 
the number iV must be between 10-^ = 0.1 and 10Â° = 1. Consequently, 
the decimal point will precede the first significant figure of N. 

The mantissa 3489 does not occur in the table, but it falls between 
the two tabular mantissas 3483 and 3502. 
Thus we have : 

9.3483 - 10 = log 0.2230 (from the table), 

9.3489 - 10 = log iV, 

9.3502 - 10 = log 0.2240 (from the table), 

so that N lies between 0.223 and 0.224. 

We observe that log N lies j% of the w^ay from log 0.223 toward 
log 0.224. Therefore, .V lies ^% of the way from 0.223 toward 0.224. 
That is, 

N = 0.223 + j% of 10 units of the fourth decimal place. 
But 

x'y of 10 units = xf units = 3^- units = 3 units, 

neglecting j\ which is less than i. 
Therefore 

iV = 0.2230 + 0.0003 = 0.2233. 

It often happens that we wish to subtract a logarithm from another 

smaller one. In all such cases we change the form of the minuend by 

adding and subtracting 10, or some convenient multiple of 10, as in the 

following example. 

30 34 
Problem 4. Compute -^ â€” 
^ 472.3 

Solution. We find from the table, 

log 32.34 = 1.5097 
log 472.3 = 2.6742. 



Akt. 172, 173] EXTRACTION OF ROOTS 287 

In order to subtract the latter logarithm from the former, we write 
log 32.34 = 11.5097 - 10,* 
log 472.3 = 2.6742 

W Â±i:Â±I = 8.8355 - 10 



Hence, from the table, ^^ = 0.06847 



472.3

172. Extraction of roots by means of logarithms. Since 

log^x = log x^'P - - log .V, 

it is easy to extract roots of any order bj' means of logarithms. If the 
characteristic of log x is not negative, no further remark is necessary. 
If log X is negative, we proceed as in the following example : 

Problem 5. Compute by logarithms : V'.o376, ^.5376, and \/.5376. 
Solution, losr 0.5376 = 9.7305 - 10. 



log \/.5376 = ^ log 0.5376 = Â» (19.7305 - 20) = 9.8653 - 10. 



log V.5376 = 1 log 0..5376 = ^^9.7305 - 30)= 9.9102 - 10. 



5/""^ 



log v.5376 = ^ log 0.5376 = ^49.7305 - 50)= 9.9461 - 10. 
Therefore, from the table, 



VMlQ = .7333, V.5376 =.8132, a/.5376 = .88-32. 

173. Logarithmic calculations which involve negative num- 
bers. We have defined only the logarithms of positive numbers. But 
this suffices for our purposes. Clearly, when we compute a product or 
quotient, its numerical value may be found first, without paying any 
attention to the signs of the various factors. Afterwards, the proper 
sign (+ or â€” ) may be prefixed to the result according as the number of 
negative factors is even or odd. 

The easiest way to keep a count of the negative factors is to use the 
method introduced by Gauss, of writing the letter Â» immediately after 
a logarithm which corresponds to a negative number. In forming a 
sum or difference of logarithms, we write an n after the result only if the 
number of separate logarithms affected by an n is odd. 

Example. If iV = - 222.7, we write 

log N = 2.3560 n. 

* A computer with some experience will refrain from actually writing the 
logarithm in the form ll.W)!)? â€” 10. It i.s easy for him to carry out the calculation 
as thouyh it were so written. 



288 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Akt. 174, 175 

174. Principles used in logarithmic calculations. The appli- 
cation of logarithms to numerical calculations dejjends upon the prin- 
ciples given in Art. 166, esj)ecially Theorems VII, VIII, IX, and X. As 
a consequence of these theorems, multiplication and division of two 
numbers may be replaced by the simpler operations of addition and sub- 
traction of their logarithms ; and the operations of involution and evolu- 
tion are very much simplified as indicated by Problem 5 in Art. 172. In 
fact, they are reduced to simple multiplications and divisions. 

175. Arrangement of the calculation. Every number and loga- 
rithm which occurs in a calculation sliould be properly labeled, and a 
definite place should be provided for it before the calculation is actually 
carried out. This is done by making a plan or a skeleton form. In mak- 
ing such a form, care should be taken that numbers which are to be com- 
bined by addition or subtraction shall appear close together and in the 
same column. The following example will illustrate this point. 

Example. Compute the value of ; = :^ to four significant figures, if 
X = 6.320, // = 8.674, z = 2.851. 

Solution. AVe first make a form as follows : 

[ X = log X = 

Given | y = log y = 



[z = log (xy) = 

To comj)ute t =xy/z log c = 

Result t = log t = 

In this form we have provided a place (jiroperly labeled) for every num- 
ber which will be required in the calculation. We have written log x 
and log y together in the second column because we shall have to add 
them in order to find log (.?â€¢//) for which a place has been provided just 
below. We write logz below this, because we shall have to subtract 
logc from log (xy) in order to find \ogt. Finally we provide a place 
for t which is the number we wish to compute. The necessary interpo- 
lations are performed mentally. 

We now fill out our skeleton with the numbers obtained from the 
table. 

[ X = 6.320 log X = 0.8007 

Given y = 8.674 log y = 0.9382 

[2 = 2.851 log (x?/) = 1.7389

176. The logarithmic or Gunter scale. It is possible to carry out 
logarithmic calculations graphically. Since addition of logarithms corre- 
sponds to multi2)lication of numbers, we may find the logarithm of a 
product graphically by adding line-segments, whose lengths are equal to 
the logarithms of the factors. 

But in order to do this, we must liave some means for actually finding 
a line-segment whose length shall be equal to the logarithm of a given 
number. 

Let us take a line-segment of convenient length, say 10 centimeters, 
as unit of length. In terms of this unit, the whole distance (10 centi- 
meters = 100 millimeters) represents log 10, since the logarithm of 10 is 
equal to unity. If we count all distances from the left-hand end of the 
line, we may label the right-hand end 10 to indicate that this distance 
represents log 10. The left-hand end will then be labeled 1, because 
log 1 = 0. 

From the table of logarithms we have, to two decimal places, 

log 1 = 0.00, log 2 = 0.30, log 3 = 0.48. log 4 = 0.60. log 5 = 0.70, 
^^ log 6 = 0.78, log 7 = 0.85, log 8 = 0.90, log 9 = 0.9.5, log 10 = 1.00.

THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 177 



Fig. G3. 



We mark the points on our line-segment whose distances from the left- 
hand end, measured in terms of the whole line as unit, are in order 
equal to log 2, log 3, log 4, â€¢â€¢â€¢ log 9, and label them 2, o, 4, â€¢â€¢â€¢ 9, respec- 
tively. If the whole line-seg- 

1_ I ? f ? ^ ] ? ? y ment is 10 centimeters long, 

these points will, on account of 
(1), be at distances 30, 48, 60, 
70, 78, 85, 90, 95 millimeters, respectively, from the left-hand end of 
the line-segment (see Fig. 63). 

A scale constructed in this way is called a logarithmic scale, and its 
usefulness for purposes of calulation was first pointed out by Edmund 
GuNTER* in 1620. It enables us to find a line-segment equal in length 
to the logarithm of any number between 1 and 10. It is easy to see 
how, by means of such a scale and a pair of dividers, multiplication and 
division may be reduced to the simple graphical processes of adding and 
subtracting line-segments. 

177. The slide rule. Some years before 1630, William 
OuGHTRED f noticed that the use of .the dividers might be avoided by 
constructing two equal logarithmic scales (Scales A and B of Fig. 64) 
capable of sliding by each other, as indicated in the figure.^ 

The use of this simple bit of apparatus for the purpose of multiplica- 
tion and division will be apparent from the following examples : 

To multiply 2 by 3. Place scale B in such a way that its left-hand 
index (i.e. the division marked 1) falls directly under the division 
marked 2 on scale A. Directly above the division marked 3 on scale B, 
we shall find, on scale A , the product which (of course) is 6. To justify 
this pi-ocess it suffices to note that it is equivalent to adding the loga- 
rithm of 3 to that of 2.

THE SLIDE RULE

scale B. .Over tlie division 1 of scale ]j we shall find the quotient (|= 2) 
on scale .1 (cf. Fig. (!l). 

The instrument actually in use, the Mannheim slide rule, is a slight 
amplification of the one just described (cf. Fig. 65). It has four scales, 
usually denoted by A,B, C, D, respectively, the scales A and D being on 
the rule, and B and C on the slide. 




Fk;. (W. 



The scale A is composed of two logarithmic scales such as that of 
Fig. 63, so that its right-hand end might be labeled 100, since log 100 = 2. 
On most slide rules, however, the first principal division on scale A after 
9 is not labeled 10, as in Fig. 63, but 1, the next one is not labeled 20, 
but 2, and so on to the last one, which is again labeled 1 instead of 100 
or 10. Thus, the two halves of scale A are exact copies of each other. 
This is done for precisely the same reason that the mantissas only are 
printed in our tables of logarithms. The slide rule also makes use of the 
mantissas only. The characteristics, or what amounts to the same thing, 
the position of the decimal point in the result, must be obtained by 
inspection or by special rules. 

Scale B is on the upper edge of the slide, in direct contact with scale 
A on the rule, and is an exact copy of scale A. These two scales 
together may be used for multiplication and division as explained 
above. 

Scale D is on the lower part of the rule. It is a single logarithmic 
scale, from 1 to 10, of the same length as the combined two scales of A. 
The logarithm of any number is therefore represented, on scale D, by 
a distance twice as great as that which represents the logarithm of the 
same number on scale A. It follows from this that the number which 
is found on scale A, vertically above any number of scale D, is the 
square of the latter. Any number on scale D, on the other hand, is the 
square root of the number vertically above it on scale A . 

Scale C is on the lower edge of the slide, in direct contact with slide 
D on the rule. It is an exact copy of scale D. These two scales to- 
gether may be used for multiplication and division, according to the 
same rules which hold for scales A and B. 

Besides these four scales, the slide rule is sxipplied with a runner 
(cf. Fig. 65), which is useful in performing compound operations, and 
also in comparing two scales (such as A and D), which are not in direct 



292 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 178 

contact with each other. The runner was made a permanent feature of 
the slide rule by Mannheim in 1851.* 

It often happens, in manipulating the slide rule, that the result is to 
be sought opposite a number of the slide which falls outside of the scale 
on the rule. In such cases, we may shift the slide, bringing the right- 
hand index to the place which the left-hand index occupied previously, 
and read off the result as before. For such a shift has no influence on 
the mantissa, since it merely amounts to dividing the result by 10. On 
the Mannheim rule, this shifting of the slide may be avoided by work- 
ing with scales A and B rather tlian with C and D. Scales C and D, 
however, have the advantage of greater accuracy. 

If the slide be withdrawn entirely, it will be found to have three other 
scales on its reverse side, two of which are labelled S and T. These are 
scales of logarithmic sines and tangents, respectively, and may be used 
for calculating such products as 

c sin A , c tan A . 

The middle scale on tlie reverse side is used for finding the value of 
the logarithm of a number, and is important if we wish to compute a 
power of a number with a complicated fractional exponent. 

For more complete information concerning the slide rule, we must 
refer to the manuals which are usually presented to the purchaser of 
such an instrument.! Cheap slide rules, especially constructed for the 
beginnei-, may now be obtained of all dealers under the name Student's 
or College Slide Rule. Engineers and coniputers use the slide rule so 
extensively that the student will find it advisable to make himself 
familiar with the instrument by actual use. 

The Mannheim slide rule, which we have described, admits of three- 
figure accuracy. In some (exceptional) cases, results correct to four 
decimal places may be obtained by its use. The Thacher and Fuller 
slide rules, more complicated instruments, but constructed on essentially 
the same principles, admit of far greater accui-acy. 

178. The general notion of a scale. The logarithmic scale, 
which is used in the slide rule, and the familiar scale of inches on a yard- 
stick are two special instances of the general notion of a scale. In both 
of these cases the scales are straight. One of them, the scale of inches, 
is also uniform, that is, the divisions of the scale are numbered in such 
a way that the points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., are at equal distances from 
each other. The logarithmic scale is straight but not uniform. The

Art. 179] LOGARITHMS OF DIFFP^RENT SYSTEMS 293 

scale of degrees on a graduated circle is iiiiifonn but not straight. The 
scale of hours on a sun-dial is neither uniform nor straight. 

These illustrations will suffice to explain, even without a formal def- 
inition, what is meant by a scale in general. The essential cliaracterisdc 
of a scale is that it establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the 
points of a straight or curved line on the one hand and the numbers of 
a certain set on the other hand. Moreover, this correspondence is such 
that if a point describes the line continuously in a certain direction w ith- 
out ever going backward, the corresponding numbers will grow continu- 
ously from the lowest number of the set to the highest. 

Such scales, both straight and curved, both uniform and non-uniform, 
are exceedingly useful for purposes of measurement and graphical com- 
putation and are used extensively in practice. 

179. Relation between the logarithms of two different sys- 
tems. Let a; be a positive number. If we choose a positive 
number a as base, let 

(1) \o^^x = p. 

If we clioose a second positive number h as base, let 

(2) log6 x=q. 

We wish to investigate the relation which exists between 
the logarithms of the same number x taken with respect to 
the two different bases, a and h. 

From (1) and (2) we have, by the definition of logarithms, 

(3) a; = aP, x = b'' 
and therefore 

which, on account of the division formula for the exponen- 
tial function (see IX, Art. 163), may be written in either 
of the two forms 

a'' = h or a = b^. 
By the definition of logarithms we have therefore 

logg b = ' and logj, a = i, 
q ' p 



294 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 179 

whence, by multiplication, 

(4) logj, a . logâ€ž b = l. 
This result may be expressed as follows. 

Theorem I. If a and h are two positive numbers, the loga- 
rithm of a un'th respect to the hase h is the reciprocal of the 
logarithm of h with respect to the hase a. 

Let us now take the logarithm, with respect to the base 
J, of both members of the first equation of (3). We find 
(see Art. 166, Theorem IX) 

\og^x=p\ogi,a. 

But, according to (1), p is equal to logâ€ža^. Consequently, 
we find 

(5) logft X = logâ€ž X â€¢ logs a. 

On account of (4) this may be written, more conveniently, 
as follows : 

Theorem II. Equation (6) enables us to compute the 
logarithm of x with respect to the neiv base b, when the loga- 
rithm of X and the logarithm of b with respect to the old base 
a are known. 

Suppose we actually have at our disposal a table of com- 
mon logarithms. Then we know log^Q x for all values of rr, 
and we may also find from the table the value of logjg 5, 
where b is any positive number. 



Theorem III. Consequently the formula 



enables us to construct a table of logarithms with respect to any 
base b. For this purpose it is only necessary to divide all of 

* This means los^a x divided by loga b, and not loga \,\< which would be equal 
to logo a; â€” logo &. 



Art. 180] STANDARD LOGARITHMIC CURVE 295 

the logarithms of the common system hy one and the same divi- 
sor, namely by the common logarithm of the new base. 

More generally, formula (6) tells us the following : 

Theorem IV. If the logarithms of all numbers are known 
with respect to some particular base a, the logarithms of all 
nu7nbers ivith respect to any other base b may be found by di- 
viding all of the logarithms of the first system by one and the 
same divisor, namely by the logarithm of the second base tvith 
respect to the first. 

It is clear, then, that the knowledge of one system of 
logarithms is sufficient to give us complete information 
about all other systems of logarithms. This becomes even 
more evident if we express our last theorem geometrically, 
as follows : 

Theorem V. If the graph of the function log^x has been 
constructed, the graph of any other logarithmic function, log^ x, 
may be obtained from it, by either diminishing or increasing 
all of the ordinates of the first graph in the same ratio. 

This is so, because division by log^ b will decrease all ordi- 
nates in the same ratio if log,, Z> > 1. It will increase all 
ordinates of the graph in a fixed ratio if logâ€ž ^' < 1 .

of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 with respect to the base 5. How would you 
proceed if you wished to construct a four-place table of logarithms with 
respect to the base 5 ? 

2. Draw the graph of y = log.,x. What nuist you do to this graph

will always pass through the point x = 1, ?/ = 0, since 
logâ€žl = for all bases. (See Fig. Q6.^ But although these 
curves all have this point in common, 
each of them will have a different tangent 
at this point. We shall select as a stand- 
ard logarithmic curve that one whose 
tangent at the common point makes an 
angle of 45Â° with tlie a;-axis, on account

of tlie central cliaracter of. this curve as 
compared with all of the others. The question which we 
sliall have to settle is this : what is the base of that par- 
ticular system of logarithms whose graph is the standard 
logarithmic curve ? We shall denote tliis base by e and 
speak of the corresponding logarithms as natural logarithms. 

181. The derivative of the logarithmic function. In order 

to be able to answer the question raised in Art. 180, we 
must first show how to compute the slope of the tangent at 
any point of a logarithmic curve. The same argument 
which was used in Art. 87, and which was there applied 
only to integral rational functions, gives us the following 
result : 

Let f (x^ he a continuous function, and let us construct its 
graph hy putti7ig 

y=f(^)- 

If this curve has a tangent at that one of its points whose 
coordinates are x and y, the slope of the tangent will he ohtaitted 
hy evaluating the limit : 

(1) /' (,0 = lim /(^ + /0-/(x) , 

A->o h 

This limit is called the derivative off(x'). 
In our case we have 

/(a;)= log^z, 
and therefore 

f(x-\-h)=]oQ;,(x+h).

We wish to evaluate the limit which (2) ap[)roaches when 
X has any definite fixed value while h approaches zero in any 
manner whatever. Since the function log^x is not con- 
tinuous for x = (see Art. 166, Theorem VI), we shall, on 
this account, assume that the fixed v^lue assigned to x is not 
zero. 

We first rewrite (2) as follows : 

(3) /(2LÂ±^l^Â£Â£) = l,og,(i+^^). 

Since, in evaluating this limit, x is to be I'egarded as a fixed 
number different from zero, we may introduce 

(4) ^ = t

as a new variable in place of h. As 7i approaches zero, t will 
also approach zero. But from (4) we find 

h = xt

Let us assume provisionally that (1 + ^ ' actually ap- 
proaches a definite finite limit, different from zero, when t 
approaches zero in any manner whatever, and let us denote 
this limit by the letter e. Since the function log^a; is con- 
tinuous in the neighborhood of any finite positive value x =p 
(see Art. 166, Theorem I), we may write 

lim logo a; = logojt). (See Art. 96.) 
We shall^ therefore, Jifid from (5) the following expression 

(6) 

for the derivative of 

or, what amounts to the same thing, for the slope of the tangent 

of the curve y â€” logâ€ž x at that one of its points which has the 
abscissa x. 

Let us apply this theorem to that point of the curve for 
which x=l and therefore y = 0.* We find the following 
result : The slope of the line which is tangent to the graph of 
logo a; *^ ^^^ point a; = 1, y = 0, is equal to log^ e where 

1 
(7) e = lim (1 + 0^ 

In order that this tangent may make an angle of 45Â° with 
the a;-axis, its slope must be equal to unity. Therefore in 
this case logâ€že must be equal to 1, and this is so if and only 
if a = e. 

Consequently, the standard logarithmic curve, ivhose tangent 

at the point a; = 1, ?/ = makes an angle of 45Â° with the x-axis, 

corresponds to that system of logarithms whose base is the 

number 

1 

e = lim (1 + ty. 

The number e is called the natural or Napierian base, and 
the corresponding system of logarithms is called the system 

* This is the point common to all logarithmic curves. (See Art. 180.) 



Art. 182] THE NUMERICAL VALUE OF e 299 

of natural logarithms. The notation In x is sometimes used 
for the natural logarithm of x. 

182. The numerical value of e. It is a rather difficult 

matter, and quite beyond the scope of this book, to prove that 

1 
(1 + ty actually approaches a definite finite limit when t ap- 
proaches zero. To prove this it is necessary to show that 

1 
(1 + t)'- will approach the same limit when t approaches zero 
throuoli a sequence of positive values as when t approaches 
zero through negative values, that the limit will be the same 
whether t approaches zero continuously or by a series of 
jumps. If, however, we grant the existence of the limit we 
can easily gain a very fair idea as to what the value of it 
will be, by allowing t to approach zero in some particularly 
convenient fashion. 

Let us then think of t as assuming in succession the values

We shall then have 

(1) e = lim (1 + 0' = lim f 1 + - Y â€¢ 
We actually find

By using a five-place table of logarithms we easily find (to 
four significant figures) 

(1 + ^)10 = 2.594, (l + 3io)ioo = 2.704. 

The true value of e to eight decimal places is 

(2) g = 2.71828123. 

We may also obtain this value as follows. Let us expand 
f 1 + - j by means of the binomial theorem. (See Art. 88.) 
We find

183. Exponential equations. An equation, some or all of 
whose terms are exponential functions of the unknown quan- 
tity, is called an exponential equation. We have no general 
method for solving exponential equations, but the method of 
trial and error explained in Art. 99 will usually enable us to 
find approximate values for the unknown quantity. 

Tliere are two cases, however, in which the problem may be 
reduced to that of algebraic equations. 

Case I. The equation is of the form 

where a, 5, c, .â€¢â€¢, /, m, n, â€¢â€¢â€¢ are constants, and where the ex- 
ponents /(x), g{x), 7i(2-), ..-, </)(./â€¢), V^O'), %(.*â€¢), ".are all 
either constants or rational functions of x.

302 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 183 

and this is a rational equation, which may be solved by the 
methods of Chapter VI, Art. 145. This method consists in 
reducing (2) to an equivalent integral rational equation, 
which may then be solved by the methods of Chapters II to V. 

Thus, the equation 

23x521-1 _ 45131+1 

becomes, if we take the logarithms of both members, 

3 x log 2 + (2 X - 1) log5 -Tjx log 4 + (x + 1) log 3 

where common logarithms are meant. This may be written 

(3 log 2 + 2 log 5 â€” 5 log 4 â€” log 3)x â€” log 3 + log 5, 
whence 

^ ^ log 3 + log 5 ^ 

3 log 2 + 2 log 5 â€” 5 log 4 â€” log 3 '

2 log5 - 7 log 2 - log 3 1.3980 - 2.1070 - 0.4771 



Case II. The equation is of the form 

(3) Aa"-f''-^ + ^a'"-i'-^^-^> + (7a("-2'/('> + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + La-^^-''^ + M= 0. 

where f(^x^ is a rational function of x. 
In this case we put 

(4) Â«/(-) = ^, 

thus reducing (3) to an algebraic equation for ^, namely 

(5) A2/" + Btr-' + -' + Li/ + M=0. 

Lety^ be one of the n roots of (5). Then we find from (4), 
taking logarithms of both members, 

/(a:) log a = log .Vi- 
and this is an algebraic equation for x. 

Thus, the equation, in which c denotes a given number, 

(6) 1(6=^ + e-Â»^) = c, 

may be reduced to the form (3) by multiplying both members by 2 e". 

It then becomes 

e2i + 1 = 2 e'c 
or 

gaÂ» _ 2 e*c + 1 = 0. 



Art. 184] CALCULATION OF LOGARITHMS 803 

If we put 
(7) e* = /y or x= logey, 

we find a quadratic equation for ij, namely 
which gives, when solved for y, 



y = c Â± Vc^ - 1, 
and therefore, on account of (7), 



X = log, ((â€¢ Â± \/c2 - 1).

184. The calculation of a table of logarithms. We ap- 
proached the theory of logarithms by way of the index laws. 
But this was not the path pursued by the first inventors of 
logarithms, John Napier (1550-1617) and Jobst Burgi 
(1552-1632).* In fact, the notation x" was not in use in 
their time and consequently the index laws were not avail- 
able to them, although in a certain sense they were probably 
well known even then.f 

Both Napier and Biirgi observed that the numerical opera- 
tions involved in multiplication are much more burdensome 
than those required in addition. They, therefore, sought a 

* Napier was of Scotch and Biirgi of Swiss nationality. Biirsi's discovery 
of logarithms was unquestionably independent of Napier's and was made at 
about the same time. But Napier's book Miriftci Lof/aritkmonmi canonis 
descriptio, containing an account of his method, was published in 1614, six years 
earlier than Biirgi's Arithmetisdte and Grometrische Pror/ress-Tahulen. For 
an account of the history of logarithms consult Cajori in the Aiaerican 
Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 20 (19i;i).

304 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 184 

method of reducing multiplication to addition, and both of 
them accomplished this purpose independently by the follow- 
ing scheme : 
Let 

\i-) d-^i 0-c^i (l^>, d^i â€¢â€¢â€¢, (In-, â€¢" 

be a sequence of numbers in geometric progression, and let 

(2) 5^, 62, ^3, ?>4, ..., Jâ€ž, ... 

be a second sequence of numbers which are in arithmetic 
progression. Moreover, let us think of these two sequences 
as being in correspondence, so that to a^ corresponds 6â€ž. 
Then to the product of two numbers Â«i and a;^ of the first 
sequence will correspond the sum of the corresponding two 
numbers hi and b/^ of the second sequence. Consequently, 
if we actually have two such sequences worked out we may 
multiply a^ by % as follows. Find the numbers h^ and 5^ of 
the second sequence which correspond to a,- and % respec- 
tively, add bi and J^., and then find the number of the first 
sequence which corresponds to b^ -\- b/.. This will be the 
product of tti and a^.-. 

Of course this scheme is for us merely an application of 
Theorem XI of Art. 166. In fact, the numbers Jj, b^-, â€¢â€¢â€¢ 
will be the logaritlims of tfj, a^-, "â€¢ with respect to some base. 
But for Napier and Biirgi, tliis correspondence between the 
terms of a geometric and an arithmetic progression was not 
a theorem, but served as a definition for logarithms. 

It is easy enough to find sucli correspondences. Thus, 
the numbers 

(3) 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, ... 
form a geometric progression, anil the numbers 

(4) 0,1,2,3,4,... 

form an arithmetic progression of the kind described in 
(1) and (2). But in order that this correspondence may 
actually be useful for purj)oses of calculation, the terms of 
each of the two progressions should be much closer together 



Akt. 184] CALCULATION OF LOGARITHMS 305 

than they are in the two progressions (3) and (4). We 
therefore insert any convenient number of geometric means 
between any two terms of (3), and just as many arithmetic 
means between the corresponding two terms of (4). The 
easiest way to do this is to insert one mean of each kind at a 
time, since tliis may be accomplisluMl l)y merely extracting a 
square root. 

Thus, tlie geometric mean between tlie first two terms of 
(3) is V10= 3.1623. (See Art. 61.) The arithmetic mean 
between the first two terms of (4) is 1.5. (See Art. 57.) 
Our two progressions now read as follows : 



(5) 


1, 


3.1623, 


10, 


31.623, 


100, 


316.23, 


1000, 


(^!) 


0, 


0.5, 


1, 


1.5, 


2 


2.5, 


3, 



In order to have the terms of the progression still closer 
to each other, we use the geometric mean between the first 
two terms of (5) namely V3.162o = 1.7783, and the arith- 
metic mean between the first two terms of (6) namely 0.25. 
Our two progressions now become 

(7) 1, 1.7783, 3.1623, 5.6234, 10, ... 
and 

(8) 0, 0.2500, 0.5000, 0.7500, 1, .... 

In our notation this signifies that 

log 1.7783 = 0.2500, log 3.1623 = 0.5000, etc. 

It is clear how, by continuing this process, a table of 
logarithms will result. To be sure, this will not yet be in 
convenient form, since the numbers are arranged in geomet- 
ric progression instead of being spaced equally. But from 
the logarithms obtained in this way, the logarithms of inter- 
mediate numbers may afterward be obtained by interpola- 
tion, thus finally enabling us to find the logarithms of the 
equally spaced numbers 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. 

There are other, far more convenient, methods for calculat- 
ing a table of logarithms, and some of these will be explained 



306 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Arts. 185-187 

later on, although a complete proof of these other methods 
is beyond the scope of this book. 

185. Applications of logarithms. In all extensive numeri- 
cal calculations which involve multiplication or division, the 
introduction of logarithms is advisable. Trigonometry is 
full of illustrations of this remark. Another field in which 
logarithmic calculation is almost indispensable is offered by 
the problems of compound interest, some of which we shall 
now discuss. 

186. Simple interest. When a capitalist lends out money, 
he usuall}^ charges the borrower a fee which is called 
interest. The sum loaned is called the principal ; the princi- 
pal plus the interest accrued at the end of any period is 
called the amount due at that time. The rate is said to be 
i2% annually if interest is charged at the rate of R cents per 
year for every dollar of the principal. 

If f P is the principal, and R the rate, the interest at the 

PR 

end of one year will be ^- At the same rate, the interest 

nPR 

at the end of n years will be $ , and the amount due at 

^ 100 

the end of n years will be 

(1) ^=^-+^=^(1 + 

In what follows we shall use the letter r to stand for 
^/lOO. Then (1) assumes a simpler form, namely 

(2) A^ = P(\ + nr). 

187. Compound interest. If the borrower pays his interest 
annually, the formula just derived gives a correct result for 
the total amount which he should return to the lender. But 
if he wishes to pay nothing until the n years have passed, 
this formula should be modified. For, by retaining the 
various installments of interest as they become due from 
year to year, he is depriving the lender not only of the use 



Art. 187] COMPOUND INTP:REST 307 

of the principal, but also of the interest which each installment 

might have earned for the lender in the meantime. Account 

is taken of this circumstance in computing compound interest. 

The interest at 7v% annually on a jirincipal of 8P is 

PR 

â€” â€” -â€¢ Thus the amount at the end of the first year is 

100 -^ 

where again we put 

^ R 
** lOO' 

During the second year we regard JLj as the principal. The 
amount at the end of the second year will be 

A^ = A^-\- A^r = A^Q. + r). 

If we substitute for A^ the value just found, this becomes 

Similarly, during the third year we regard A^ as principal, 
and Und 

A,^F(l + ry 

as the amount due at the end of the third year. Finally we 
find the formula 

(1) A^ = P(l + ry. 

for the amount due at the end of n years on a principal of $P 
at the rate of R% a year compound i7itere8t, if the interest is 
compounded annually. 

Formula ("2) of Art. 18G shows that the amounts due at the end of 
one, two, three, etc., years form an arithmetic progression at simple 
interest. Formula (1) of the present article shows that they form a 
geometric progression when compound interest is charged. 

Formula (1) may also be used to solve the following prob- 
lem. What sum must be invested now, allowing compound 
interest at the rate of R(fo annually, so that the amount at 
the end of n years shall be a given sum ? 

Let P be the unknown sum to be invested, and let A^ be 



308 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 188 

its amount at the end of n years. Then A^ and P are con- 
nected by equation (1) and A^ is to be regarded as a given 
quantity ; consequently we tind 

(2) P=^â€ž(l+rr" 

by solving (1) for P ; the value of P is called the present 
value of a sum A^ which is to be paid at the end of n years, 
allowing compound interest ?it R %. 

188. Annuity. A fixed sum paid annually is called an 
annuity. Let us compute the amount A of an annuity of 
â€¢fa per year which is allowed to accumulate for n years with 
compound interest at 72 % . 

This problem is important in such cases as the following. A corpora- 
tion (perhaps a life insurance company) makes a contract with a 
person X, promising to pay him a certain sum of money at the end of 
twenty years, in return for certain fixed sums called premiums which are 
to be paid by X to the corporation annually. The corporation invests 
its money at R per cent. In order to be able to fulfill its contract, the 
company must know how to calculate the sum of all the payments made 
by A' plus the interest on these payments. 

If the first annual installment a is due at the end of the 
first year, it earns interest during w â€” 1 years ; therefore its 
amount will be a(\ -\- r)""^. The second installment earns 
interest during wâ€” 2 years; its amount will therefore be 
a(l -I- r)"~^. The last installment will earn no interest. 
Thus the total amount will be 

A = a(l-j-r)"-i-fa(l-|-r)"-2 4. . . . j^ a{\ â– \- r') ^ a^ 

or if we write the terms in inverse order, 

J. = a + a(l + r) -F a(l -f- r)2 -t- â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ -f a(l -}- ry-^. 

The terms in the right member form a geometric progres- 
sion of n terms, the common ratio being 1 -|- r. Therefore, 
the sum is (Art. 60) 

(1) A^a^-^Sl^^a\^(lÂ±ir = 'L^a + rr-^. 

1 â€” (1 + r) â€”r r 



akt. iÂ«!)] compound interest 309 

Formula (1) enables us to compute the amount A of an annuity 
of ^ a per year which is allowed to accumulate for n years at R 
per cent compound interest. 

It is often necessary to compute the present value of an 
annuity of '^a ?i year to continue for 71 years, allowing com- 
pound interest at the rate of R per cent, 

Tims, a person wishes to pay a corporation noiv a lump sum to be 
returned to him as an annuity of f 500 per year for ten years. The 
corporation must know how to compute the lump sum which is adequate 
for this purpose. 

The present value of ^a due one year hence is a(\ + r)"^. 
(See equation (2), Art. 187.) The present value of $a due 
two years hence is â€¢a(l + r)"^, etc. The present value of 
$a due 71 years hence is a(l + r)~". Therefore, the total 
present value of this annuity is 

P= a{\ +r)-i + a(l +r)-^+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ + a(l +r)-". 

This is a geometric progression of n terms, with the common 
ratio (1 + r)~i. Tlierefore, we have

or

If n grows beyond bound, (1 + r)~" tends towards zero, 
since 1 + r is greater than unity. Therefore, the present 
value of a perpetual annuity (called a perpetuity^ of -fa per 
year is a/r(\ â€” 0) = a/r. 

189. Interest compounded more than once annually. We 
found in Art. 187 the formula 

A = P(\ + r)", where r = - â€” -, 
^ lUO 

for the amount due at the end of n years on a principal P at 
the rate of R per cent a year, if the interest is compounded 
annually. If the interest is compounded more than once a 
year, this formula must be modified. 



310 THP: general power function [Art. 189 

Let us suppose that the interest is to be compounded t 
times a year, and let us speak of the f"" part of a year as a 
period. The interest at the end of the lirst period will be 

P-; therefore the amount at the end of the first period is 

(1) A = ^ + i'^ = ^(i + 0. 

During the second period we regard A^ as the principal. 
The interest on this principal earned during the second 

period will be A-^- so that the amount at the end of the 
second period will be 

A, = A, + A/- = A,(l + '^ 

which, on account of (1), gives 

Since n years contain nt periods, we find finally the formula 

(2) ^ = p(l + 0" where r=^, 

for the amount due at the end of n years on a principal P at 
the rate of R per cent annually., if the interest is compounded 
t times a year. 

In this formula we may think of t as growing beyond 
bound. As a consequence the period will approach zero as 
a limit, and we find the following result. The formula 

(3) A = P lim f 1 + ^ 

will give the amount due at the end of n years on a principal 
P at the rate of R per cent annually, if tlie interest is com- 
pounded instantaneously or continuously. 

But we are in a position to actually evaluate this. limit. 
Let us put t = kr. Since r is a fixed number, k will then

years on a principal P at the rate of R per cent annually, if 
the interest is compounded continuously. 

We observe that the amount, as given by (5), is an ex- 
ponential function whose base is e, the exponent being the 
product of the annual rate and the number of years.

190. The compound interest law. Formula (5) of Art. 189 
has many applications besides the one already noted. The 
essential thing about this formula is that it represents the 

* In many of these examples four-place tables of logarithms are not sufficient 
to give results accurate to the nearest cent. In solving such examples, the 
student should l)e satisfied with an approximate result if he has no other tables 
at his disposal tlian those given in the Appendix of this book. Otlierwise he 
should use some of the more extensive tables mentioned in the footnote on 
page 289. 



312 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 191 

amount ^ as a function of w, the number of years (P and r 
being regarded as constants), and that this function has the 
special property that its rate of growth at any instant is pro- 
portional to its own magnitude. For that is the way in 
which the amount due on a loan grows when the interest is 
compounded instantaneously. Whenever we have a relation 
of this kind between two variables x and ?/, such that the 
rate of change of y is proportional to y itself, then y will be 
connected with x by means of an equation of the form 

(1) y = ae'"' 

where a and b are constants ; that is, y will be an exponential 
function of x. On account of this connection, the relation 
between two variables expressed by an equation of the form 
(1) is frequently called the compound interest Imv^ a name in- 
troduced by Lord Kelvin (1824-1907), a famous British 
physicist. The importance of this law lies in the fact that it 
occurs so frequently in the applications, some of which we 
shall now explain. In making these applications it should 
be remembered, however, that 5, the coefficient of x in (1), 
may be either positive or negative. If a and h are both 
positive, as in the case of Art. 189, y is an increasing function 
of X and the constant increase in log y which corresponds to 
an increase of one unit in x is called the logarithmic increment. 
If a is positive while h is negative, ?/ is a decreasing function 
of a;, and the decrease in log y which is caused by a unit in- 
crease of x is called the logarithmic decrement. 

191. Dampened vibrations. If a weight is attached to one 
end of a string, whose other end is attached to a fixed sup- 
port, an impetus given to the weight will cause it to oscillate 
about its position of equilibrium. This simple piece of ap- 
paratus is called a pendulum. Let the motion of the pendu- 
lum take place in a vertical plane. The displacement of the 
pendulum from its position of equilibrium at any instant 
may be measured by the angle which the string makes at 
that moment with a vertical line. The larsfest value of this 



Art. 192] PRESSURE IX THE ATMOSPHERE 313 

angle during one comjjlete oscillation is called the amplitude 
of the oscillation. Owing to friction and resistance of the 
air, the amplitude of the vibration gradually decreases. Ob- 
servation shows that the amplitudes of successive vibrations 
of the pendulum form (very approximately) a decreasing 
geometric progression. We may therefore write 



k-l 



(1) A = A,e- 

where t represents the time, expressed in seconds or some 
other unit of time, which has elapsed from the beginning of 
the motion, where Aq represents the amplitude (expre.ssed in 
radians or degrees) of the vibration at the beginning of the 
motion, and where A represents the amplitude after t time 
units have passed. 

The coefficient of t in the exponent has been written in the 
form â€” k^ to emphasize the fact that it is negative. This 
must be so to make each amplitude smaller than the preced- 
ing one. The actual value of this coefficient depends upon 
the amount of friction and resistance. If k is large, for in- 
stance if the pendulum is swinging in water, the vibrations 
will cease very soon. If k is small, it will take a long time 
before the pendulum comes to rest. 

Strictly speaking, if formula (1) be regarded as absolutely true, it 
will always take an infinite time to produce absolute rest. For, accord- 
ing to (1), A cannot become equal to zero for any finite value of t. But 
when the continually increasing quantity k-t l)ecoines large enough, the 
corresponding value of A will become so small as to become immeasur- 
able. When this condition has been reachetl, the pendulum may be re- 
garded as being at rest, for practical purposes, since its motion has 
become imperceptible. 

Formula (1) is applicable to other cases of dampened vi- 
bration. The case of a pendulum swinging in air is merely 
a particular case of dampened vibrations. 

192. Variation of density and pressure in the atmosphere. 
It is a familiar fact that the air is less dense on the top of a 
mountain than at sea level. It is easy to see why this should 
be so, since the air at higher levels, by its weight, helps to 



314 THE GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Art. 193 

compress the air which is below it. For the same reason the 
pressure (as measured by a barometer) is less at greater alti- 
tudes than at sea level. 

The following formula due to Halley (1656-1742), a 
famous English astronomer, very nearly represents the facts 
as obtained by observations at various altitudes. Let p^ be 
the density of air at sea level (compare Art. 44 for definition 
of density), and let p be the density of air at an altitude of h 
meters above sea-level. According to Halley's formula we 
shall have 



(1) p = PqB 



8000 



The pressure of the atmosphere at any height may be 
measured in pounds per square inch, or may be expressed by 
means of the barometer in terms of millimeters of mercury. 
Since the pressure is proportional to the density, we may also 
write 

(2) P=Poe~^. 

where Pq is the pressure at sea level (15 pounds per square 
inch, corresponding to a height of the barometer of 760 
millimeters), and where p is the pressure at a height of h 
meters above sea level. 

193. Transmission of light by imperfectly transparent me- 
dia. When light passes through a medium like air, water, 
or glass, some of the light is absorbed, although most of it is 
transmitted. The amount of light absorbed depends upon 
the nature of the medium and its thickness. Even glass 
ceases to be transparent if it is thick enough. 

Let L be the intensity of the light transmitted by a sheet 
of glass X millimeters thick. We shall have 

(1) L = L,e-^'^ 

where i^ is the intensity of the incident light, that is, the 
intensity of the light before any absorption has taken place, 
and where k"^ is a coefficient whose value depends upon the 
quality of the glass. 



Art. 194] COOLING BODIES 315 

Let us take the intensity of the incident light as unit of intensity. 
Suppose that a pane of ghiss ;} millimeters thick absorbs 2% of the inci- 
dent light. Then we shall have Z^, = 1, and L â€” 0.98 for x = 3, so that 

0.98 = e-3*'. 
Consequently we have 

- 3 ^-2 log e = log 0.98, 
whence 

^, ^ _ logos ^ _ 9.9912 - 10 ^ 0,0088 ^ 
31oge 1.3029 1.3029 

so that we find for this quality of glass the formula 

for the percentage of light transmitted by a pane x millimeters thick. 

194. Cooling bodies. If a warm body is placed in a 
niedium whose temperature is kept fixed and which is cooler 
than the body, the latter will cool off at a rate proportional 
to the difference between its temperature and that of the sur- 
rounding medium. This law of cooling, due to Newton, 
may be expressed by the formula 

= 0^ + (0^-e,)e-''\ 

where Oq is the temperature of the medium, ^j is the original 
temperature of the body, 6 its temperature after t time units 
have passed, and F is a coefficient whose value depends upon 
the material of wliich the body is composed and upon the 
nature of the surrounding medium. 

EXERCISE LXXXIII 

1. Assuming Halley's formula, at what height will the pressure of 
the atmosphere be just one half of what it is at sea level ? 

2. A body of temperature 55" C. is cooling off, surrounded by air 
whose temperature is 15Â° C. After eleven minutes the temperature of 
the body was found to be 25'' C. Find the value of k- and write out 
Newton's formula for this body. 

3. According to the formula found in Example 2, what time is re- 
quired for the body to cool off 5Â° ? 

-4. A dampened vibration begins with an amplitude of 10 centimeters. 
After nine minutes the amplitude- is found to be only one centimeter. 
Express by a formula the change which takes place in the amplitude 
in the course of time.

THE (GENERAL POWER FUNCTION [Akt. 195 



195. Semi-logarithmic paper. Wlienever we have two variables 
X- and y connected by an exponential equation, 

(1) y = ae'"^, 

as in Arts. 190-19-1, we may construct the graph of this equation as in 
Art. 162. The resulting graph is, of course, an exponential curve. We 
may, however, convert the graph into a straight line by the following 
device : 

Let us take the logarithms of l)oth memliers of (1). We find 

(2) log y = log a + log(e''^) = log a + hx log e. 
If now we put 

(3) A' = X. Y = log y, h log e = M, log a = B, 
equation (2) may be written 

(4) Y = MX + B. 

If we regard X and Y as the coordinates of a point in the plane, the 
locus of equation (4) is a straight line of slope M which intersects the 
I'-axis in the point (0, B). (See Art. 54.) Thus, the transformation 
which consists in putting 



(5) 



A' = X, Y =\ogy 



transforms the exponential curve which is the locus of equation (1) into a 
straight line. 

In order to actually carry out this transformation we might proceed 
as follows: If (x, y) are two numbers which satisfy equation (1), we 
put X equal to x and compute Y = log y. Then we plot the point whose 

coordinates are A' and F instead 
of the point (.c, y). But an 
easier way of accomplishing the 
same result is to provide the 
3^-axis with a logarithmic scale 
such as is used on the slide rule. 
(See Arts. 170 and 177.) The 
point of the //-axis which corre- 
sponds to any number y on this 
scale will then be at a distance 
from the origin which is equal 
to log y. If the a:-axis is pro- 
vided with an ordinary uniform 
scale, we can lay off our x-co6r-

riuiged in this way is called se mi-hxiarithnic papfr. and is particularly well 
adapted for the grapliic representation of exponential eciuations of tlie 
form (1). On semi-logarithmic paper, tlie graph of such a relation is 
a straight line. Figure 07 represents a sheet of semi-logarithmic paper. 



196. Logarithmic paper. If both axes are provided with loga- 
rithmic scales, instead of one of the axes only, and if the paper is ruled in 
accordance with these scales, we obtain a sheet of logarithmic paper. See 
Fig. 08. This is particularly adapted for the graphic representation of 
relations such as 

(1) 7/ = flX*, 

in which a power function occurs. For, if we take the logarithms of 
both members of (1), we find 

(2) log y = log a + log a* = log a + I: log x. 
Consequently, if we put 

(3) X = log X, Y = log y, B = log a, M = k, 
eipuition (2) becomes 

(-1) Y = MX + B, 

the graph of which is a straight line. Thus, on lor/nrithmic paper wJiere 
both sets (if rulinr/s are made on a logarithmic scale, the graph of any power 
function is a straight line. 

If, as a result of a series of 
observations, pairs of corre- 
sponding values of x and ^ are 
given, and if a preliminary in- 
spection of these values sug- 
gests that the relation between 
X and y may be of the foi'm 
of a power function, y = ax^, 
it will- be advisable to plot the 
points on logarithmic paper. 
If the i-esulting graph is a 
straight line, we can easily find 
the values of M and B and 
afterward, from (8), the values 
of a and k. If the relation 
seems to be of the form of an 

exponential function, it will instead be advisable to use semi-logarithmic 
paper.

197. Functions of two variables. A variable z is said to be 
a function of two independent variables^ x and y, if to defi- 
nitely assigned tmlues of x and y there correspond definite 
values of z. Such relations are usually indicated by equa- 
tions of the form 

(1) z=f{x,y'), 

where / may be replaced by other letters sucli as JP, ^, i/r, 
and so on. The equation (1) may be read z is equal to the 
/-function of x and y.

of the length of three mutually perpendicular edges. 

8. Express the volume and the total surface of a right circular cylin- 
der as functions of the altitude and the radius of the base. 

198. Linear functions of two variables. Ami function of 
the two variables x and y/, which cayi he expressed m the form 
ax + by + <?, ivhere a, b, and c are constants, is called a linear 
function of x and y. 

Thus, X + y/ + 1, 3 x + I // â€” 1, .r â€” y â€” 2, â€” 2 x + // + 7 are linear 
functions of x and y. 

When we compute the values of a linear function of x and 
//, we find that there are many pairs of values for x and // to 
which corresponds the same value of the function. 

Tims, let/(.r, ij) = x + // + 1. We find 

/(O, 4) =/(!, :}) =/(2. 2) =/(:',, 1) =/(!. 0) ../(.l, - 1) = 5. 

If we plot the points (0, I), (1, o), (2, 2), etc., we find that they are 
all on a certain straight line. 

Let US investigate this question in general. All of those 
values of a; and //, which cause the function ax -f- by + c to 
assume a given value h, must satisfy the equation 

(1) ax -\-by + <â–  = k, or 

(2) . ax+by + c -k = 0. 

But we have seen in Art. 54 that all of those points 
whose coordinates, x and y, satisfy an equation of the first 
degree are on a straight line. Similarly those values of x 
and y which cause the function ax -{-by + c to assume a sec- 
ond given value k' correspond to the points of a second 
straight line, namely to the locus of the equation 

(3) ax + by + c -k' = 0. 

If 6 = 0, the lines (2) and (o) are both parallel to tiie y-axis 
(see Art. 54). \{ b is not equal to zero, both lines have the 
same slope, namely, â€”a/b (see Art. 54). Thus the two 
lines (2) and (3) are parallel in either case. 



AuT. 1!)9] LINEAR EQUATIONS 321 

We hiive found the following resnlt. // we interpret x 
and y as the rectanr/ular coordinates of a point in a plane, all 
of those points whose coordinates cause a linear function, such 
as a.v + l>t/ -\- c. to assume a given value k are on a sfraic/ht line. 
Thus there is one such straight line for everg value of k, and 
the straight lines wli/rh correspond to any two dttferent values 
of k are parallel. 

EXERCISE LXXXVI 

1. Plot the straight line upon whicli the function f{x, 1/)= x + 1/ + I 
assumes the value â€” ^3 ; also jilot the lines upon which f{x,y) = â€” 2 
f{x, //)--!, /(x, y) =0, f{x, y) = + 1, /(x, ^) = + 12, /(x, y)= + -d. 
Observe that the straight line upon which f{x, y) = divides tlie plane 
into two portions such that ./'(x, y) is negative on one side of this line 
and positive on the other. 

2. Study each of the following functions by the nietiiod outlined in 
Example 1. 

(a) 2x-^ + 3. (c) 3a:-4.y+5. (e) 2x + ^y-l. 

\b) x + 2y + 3. {<!) 4x + 3y + 5. (/) 3x-2y + 2. 

199. Linear equations. We have seen in Art. 198 that 
those values of x and y ivhich cause the linear function ax + by 
â– +â–  c to assume the value k, are exactly the same as those which 
cause another linear function, namely ax + by + c â€” k, to assume 
the value zero. 

The following problem is therefore especially important. 
Given any linear function ax + 5y + c. To find the values 
of X and y which cause it to assume the value zero; or, in 
other words, to find all of those values of x and y which 
satisfy the equation 
(1) ax ^by -\-c = (^. 

An equation of this form, obtained by equating to zero a 
linear function of two variables, is called a linear equation 
or an equation of the first degree with two unknowns. Any 
pair of numbers, x and ;y, which satisfies such an equation 
is called a solution of (1 ). 

Observe that it takes an ./â–  and a //. tliat is, a pair of numbers, to con- 
stitute a solution. Thus the equation x + // â€” .5 = has as one of its 
solutions X = 1, ^ = 4. Other solutions are x = 0, y = o ; x = 2. ?/ = .3. 



322 LINEAR EQUATIONS AND DETERMINANTS [Art. 200 

Every equation of the form (1) has infinitely many solu- 
tions. These may be obtained as follows. If ^ ^t we find 
from (1), by solving for y, 

(2) ^ = -1^-1- 

If we give to x any value whatever, and use (2) to compute 
for every x a corresponding value of y, the pairs of corre- 
sponding numbers, x and Â«/, obtained in this way will all be 
solutions of (1)*. 

If, however, ft = 0, (1) reduces to ax â– }- c = and this gives 

(3) x = --. ' 

a 

wliich determines x completely, but allows y to have any 
value whatever. In this case also we have infinitely many 
solutions. 

We first considered linear equations in Art. 54. We 
proved there that such an equation defines y as a linear 
function of a: if b is different from zero, and that in all cases 
the graph of an equation of the first degree between x and y 
is a straight line. This, in fact, was the reason for speak- 
ing of such equations as linear equations. 

EXERCISE LXXXVII 

From each of the following equations express y as a function of x, or x 
as a function of y, whenever possible, and draw the corresponding line. 

1. 2x + y = 1. 4. 2x4-8 = 0. 

2. 3 X - 4 // = .5. 5. Sy - 9 = 0.

200. Simultaneous linear equations. We have just seen 
that there are infinitely many pairs of values of x and y 

* For let X have any value, and let ?/ = â€” ^ â€” , â€¢ Then 



ax + by + c = ax + b {â€” - X â€” -\ +

That is, every pair of numbers obtained in this way will actually satisfy the 
given equation.

which satisfy a single equation of the form 

(1) a^x + h^y + (?j = 0, 

and that each of these pairs may be interpreted as the co- 
ordinates of a point on a certain straight line, the locus of 
the equation. Similarly, the solutions of a second equation 

(2) a^x + h.^y + c.^ =0,* 

correspond to the points of a second straight line. If these 
two lines are not parallel and if they do not coincide, they 
will have just one point of intersection. The coordinates of 
the point of intersection must satisfy each of the two equa- 
tions (1) and (2), and it is the only point whose coordinates 
satisfy both of these equations. 

The coordinates of the pointy in which the lines represented 
hy the two equations intersect^ may therefore be obtained hy 
solving the equations (1) and {'2) simidtaneously^ that is^ by 
finding the values of x and y which will satisfy both of these 
equations at the same time. 

This statement shows us how to solve a certain problem 
of geometry (intersection of two lines) by algebra (solu- 
tion of equations. (1) and (2)). We may just as well, how- 
ever, regard this theorem as the geometric solution of an 
algebraic problem. For it may be restated as follows : 

To solve the equations (1) and (2) simultaneously., we draw 
the lines which are the loci of (1) and (2) and deternmie the 
coordinates of the point of intersection by measurement. 

However, it should be remarked that in general this 
later method will give us only an approodmate value of 
the solution. 

* The notation oj, uo, h^, bo, etc., is very convenient. As liere used the letter 
a indicates a coefficient of x; Uy for the first, a-i for the second equation. Sim- 
ilarly ^1 denotes the coefficient of y in equation (1), and bo the coefficient of i/ 
in (2).

201. General formulas for the solution of two simultaneous 
linear equations with two unknowns. Let us transpose the 
terms c^ and c^ of equations (1) and (2) of Art. 200, and let 
us call â€” <?j and â€” c^, k^ and k,^ respectively, so that the 
equations assume the form 



(1) 
(2) 



a^x -f h^ = k^' 



To solve these equations we first eliminate y. This may be 
done by multiplying both members of (1) by h^, and both 
members of (2) by â€” h^, ;ind adding. We find 

Similarly, elimination of x from (1) and (2) gives

values of x and y really satisfy both equations (1) and (2).

Thus, the solution of the simultaneous equations {\) and (2) 
is given hy (5), provided that a^h^ â€” a^^ is different from

202. Determinants of the second order. The values of x 
ami y as i^iveu by (5), Art. 201, appear as fractions with a 
euuiinon denominator. This denominator is made up en- 
tirely of the four numbers a^, b^, a^, b^, which appear in 
equations (1) and (2) of Art. 201 as coefficients of x and y. 
Let us write these coefficients in the order in which they 
appear in these equations, thus : 



and let us introduce a new symbol made up of these four 
numl)ers written between two vertical lines, thus :

ec^uations are said to be homogeneous. 
Tlius, the two equations

a^x -f h^y = 0, 
a^x + h^y = 0. 



Ai:t. 2o:5] HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR EQUATIONS 827 

form a Jioniogeneous system. If the determinant 

is different from zero, equations (2) of Art. 202 show that 
the only solution of (1) and (2) is .'r = ?/ = 0, since both of 
the numerators which occur in (2), Art. 202, will vanish 
when Tc^ and h.^ are equal to zero. The solution ./â€¢ = y = of 
the equations (1) and (2) is often called an obvious or trivial 
solution, because it is evident that every system of this form 
has this solution. 

But if the determinant D is equal to zero, it does not follow 
that the system (1) (2) has x=i/ = as its only solution, 
since the expressions (2) of Art. 202 become useless in this 
case, on account of their indeterminateness. 

We can easily show that in this case (when D = 0), there 
do exist other solutions of (1) and (2), besides the obvious 
one x= 7/ = 0. In fact, if we put in (1 ) 

(4) X = kh^, y = â€” ka^, 

where Jc is any number whatever, equation (1) will be satis- 
fied siuce, for these values of x and ij, we find 

a^r -\- h-^ij = a^kh^ + /)^( â€” ka^) = ki^a^h^â€” a^h^ = 0. 

But these same values of x and y will also satisfy (2); for 
we have 

a,2^- + h^jj = a.Jch^ -\- h.^( â€” ka^') = â€” k(a^b^ â€” a^h^) = 0, 

since, in our case, D = a-jb., â€” a.yb^ is equal to zero. Thus all 
of the pairs of numbers, which can be obtained from (4) by 
giving different values to k, will be solutions of both (1) and 
(2). Moreover, all of these solutions will not coincide with 
the obvious solution x= y = unless a^ and 5j are both equal 
to zero. Let us exclude this case and also the analogous case 
in which a^ and b^ are both equal to zero, since in either of 
these cases we should really be dealing with only a single 
equation ; one at least of the equations (1) or (2) might 
then be resrarded as absent. 



328 LINEAR EQUATIONS AND DETERMINANTS [Art. 2():J 

We may summarize our results as follows: 

If the determinant D of the homogeneous equations (1) and 
( 2 ) ?'.s' not equal to zero, these equations have only a single solu- 
tion, namely, the obvious one, x = y = Q. If T) is equal to zero, 
the two equations have infinitely many solutions. More specifi- 
cally we can say that if both equations are actually present, that 
is, if neither of them has both of its coefficients equal to zero, then 
if D is equal to zero, the two equations are equivalent ; that is, 
every solutio7i of one equation is also a solution of the other. 

Although the equations (1) and (2) are satisfied by infi- 
nitely many pairs of values, x and y, \i D = 0, the ratio of x 
to y will nevertheless be determined uniquely. In fact, this 
ratio may be computed from each of the two equations, and 
the resulting two values will be found equal on account of 
the relation 2) = 0. 

Thus, the homogeneous equations (1) and (2) forx and y may 
be regarded as two no7i-homogeneous equations for a single un- 
known, the ratio of x to y ; the condition that these two equations 
7nay be consistent, that is, that they shall furnish the same value 
for this ratio, is again D = 0. 

To clarify still more the significance of the condition 
i>= 0, Ave add the following remarks. 

If a^ and b^ are common multiples of a^ and b-^, that is, if 

a^= ma-^, b^ = mb^, 

the determinant D = a^b^ â€” agi^ is equal to zero. Conversely, 
if i> = and if a^ and ^j are not equal to zero, we have 

a A - ^A = 0, or h = ^. 

If we denote by m tlie common value of tliese two fractions, 

we find 

Â«2 = ma-y, ho = mh-^, 

so that 

(5) a^x + />2,y = m(ayr + ftj?/). 



Art. 204] DISCUSSION OF GENERAL CASE 329 

Therefore, if the determinant D of (1) and {2) is equal to 
zero, and if not both of the coefficients of either equation are 
equal to zero, then the coefficients of one of the equations will he 
proportional to those of the other ; in other ivords, the left mem- 
ber of one of these equations will be a mere multiple of the left 
member of the other. 

Ill our proof we have assumed that Wj and i, are liotli different from 
zero. The student should complete the proof by considering separately 
the cases a-y4^(), 6, = 0, and r/j = 0, b^ =^ 0, the further case rr, = />, = 
being excluded by our liypothesis that not both of the cofficientsof either 
ecpiation shall vanish. The student may easily decide, however, what 
would happen in this case also. 

The theorems of tliis article are easily explained graphi- 
cally. The graplis of the two e(iiuiti()ns (1) and (2) are 
straight lines through the origin of coordinates. If the deter- 
minant D is not equal to zero, these lines are distinct and 
their only common point is the origin, x= y = 0. lfi) = 0, 
the two lines coincide, and have all of their points in common. 

204. Discussion of the solutions of two linear equations with 
two unknowns. We have seen tliat the equations 

(1) a^T + b^i/ =k^, 

(2) a.^.r + k,!j = k^^, 

have a single solution if i>=^0. (See Arts. 201 and 202.) 
If 2>= 0, we tind from (3) and (4) of Art. 201, 

(3) k^b., - kj^^ = 0, 

(4) a^k^ â€” ajc^ = 0, 

so that k^ and k.y must satisfy these conditions if (1) and (2) 
are to have any solutions at all. Bnt the left members of 
(3) and (4) are the determinants which occur in the numer- 
ators of the expressions (2) of Art. 202 for x and /y. 

Thei'efore, the si/stem of equations (1) and (2) has no solu- 
tion at all if D = U. unless at the same time both of the determi- 
nants

then (1) awe? (2) have i7ifimtel'y many solutions. Unless one 
of the two equations has all of its coefficients equal to zero., each 
of the two equations may he obtained from the other by multiply- 
ing both of its members by an appropriately chosen number., and 
the tivo equations are equivalent, that is., they have exactly the 
same solutions. 

In fact the three equations (6) are equivalent to the con- 
tinued proportion 

a-^ : b^ : k^ = a^ 'â€¢ bo : ko- 

If we remember that each of the equations (1) and (2) has 
for its graph a straight line, we see at once that the corre- 
sponding geometrical situation may be described as follows : 

The graphs of equations (1) arid (2) are distinct intersect- 
ing lines if D 4^ 0. They are distinct parallel lines if D = 
and if not both of the determinants (5) are equal to zero. The 
two graphs coincide throughout if conditions (6) are satisfied.

kiiowiis in the three equations (1), (2), (3). It does not 
depend upon the values of r^, r^^ r^ We shall henceforth 
speak of this coefficient as the determinant of these nine 
quantities, and use the symbol 

h 

to represent it. Thus we are led to the following definition : 

When nine Clumbers are writteji in the form of a square array, 
the value of their determinant, represented hy the symbol (7), 
is hy definition equal to the coefficient of x in (6). 

We have therefore the following defining equation for a 
determinant of the third order : 



(8) D = 



This formula, whicli we have used as a definition for the 
symbol in the left member, is easy to remember. Each of 
the three terms of the right member is a product of two 
factors ; one of the two factors of each of these terms is one 
of the elements a^, 6j, c^ of the first row of the determinant ; 
the other factor is that second order determinant which we 
obtain from the tliird order determinant (8) by crossing 
out the row and the column in which stands that one of the 
elements rtp h^, c^, wliich is tlie first factor of the term in 
question. The signs of the three terms are in order +, â€” â€¢> +â€¢ 

Let us substitute, in (8), for the second order determi- 
nants their values and multiply out. We find in this way 

B = a^(h^c^ - h^c^) - ^'lO'gC'g - a^c^ + c^^a^h^ - a^h^), 

which may be rewritten as follows ; 

and this expression might also be used as a definition for the 
determinant D. We see that a determinant of the third 



Art. 206] DETERMINANTS OF THE THIRL) ORDER 



335 



order consists of 6 terms, each of wliich is a product of three 
of the nine numbers a^, â– â€¢â€¢ Cg, three of tliese products being 
preceded by the plus sign, and the other three b}^ the minus 
sign. 

We find again the expression (8) for D from (9), if we unite tlie 
two terms of (!)) which contain a,, the two terms which contain ftj, and 
tlie two terms which contain Cy Let us instead unite the terms which 
contain a^, b^, cv- Then we may write D as follows:

a new expression for D similar to (8). There are again three terms. 
But this time the first factor of each term is an element of the second 
row crâ€ž, hâ€ž, câ€ž. The second factor of each term is again obtained, as in 
(8), as a second order determinant by suppressing that row and column 
of D to which the first factor of the term belongs. 

In order to express this hiw of formation more compactly 
we introduce a new word by the following definition. 

The minor of a particular one of the nine eleynents of the third 
order determinant , , 



D = 



h. 



is that second order determinant which is ohtained from D if 
the row and column he erased to which that particular elernent 
of D belongs. 

Thus the minors of n^, h^, c^ are respectively

We can now say that the two expressions. (8) and (10), for D have 
this in common. Each term of either expression is the product of an 
element of D by the minor of that element. The two expressions differ 
in so far as the elements which are used in (8) are those of tlie first row, 
while those used in (10) belong to the second row. Moreover, the terms 



336 LINEAR EQUATIONS AND DETERMINANTS [Art. 206 

are preceded by the signs +, â€” , + in (8), and by the signs â€” , +, â€” in 
(10). 

In order to get to the bottom of this matter, we now arrange the 
expression (9) for D according to the elements a^, b.^, c^ of the third row. 
We find

D = cu

Tlie resnlts (8), (10), and (11) may be summed up as follows : 

We may expand a determinant D of the third order accord- 
in;/ to the elements of the kth row^ where k may he equal to 1, 2, 
or 3. This expansion vnll present D as a sum of three prod- 
ucts of the form 

1st element of the kth row times its minor, 
2d element of the kth roiv times its minor, 
?>d element of the kth row times its minor. 

Each of these products is preceded by a plus or nmius sign, 
which is determined in accordance with the following diagram 
of signs : 

(12) ^= _ + -

Tliree further expressions for I) may he obtained by expand- 
ing with respect to the elements of any column according to the 
same rule, using the columns in the diagram of signs. 

To prove tlie last statement, it suffices to arrange D, as 
given by (9), with respect to the elements a^, a^, a^ of the' 
first column, or with respect to b^ b^, b^, or c^ c^, Cg.

207. Cofactors. The six expansions of a tliiid order de- 
terminant wliit'h we have found in Art. 20(3 assume a some- 
what simpler form if v,e introduce tlie notion of cofactor in 
place of the notion minor. Every element of the determi- 
nant D has associated with it, as its minor, a certain detei- 
minant of the second order. The expansion of D with 
respect to the elements of one of its rows or columns is com- 
plicated by the fact that some of the terms of such an 
expansion are preceded by the minus sign. We may get rid 
of this complication by uniting the minus sign with the 
corresponding minor, in accordance with the following 
definition.

208. The principal properties of determinants of the third 
order. It is now easy to prove tlie following theorems, which 
are quite analogous to the Corresponding properties of second 
order determinants. (Compare Art. 2U5.) 

1. A determinant of the third order does 7iot change its value 
if its elements are transposed, that is, if its roivs he converted 
into columns, and its columns into rows, the relative order of 
rotvs arid columns 7iot being changed. 

To prove this, let 



i) = 



If we expand D according to the elements of its first row, 
and D' according to the elements of its first column, we ob- 
tain identical results, thus proving the theorem. 

2. A third order determinant is equal to zero if all of the 
elements of any one of its roivs or columns are equal to zero. 

This follows directly if we expand the determinant with respect to the 
elements of such a row or column. 

3. A determinant of the third order changes its sign if any 
two of its columns or any two of its roivs are interchanged. For

thus proving the theorem for the case where the elements of the Jirst row 
are multiplied bj^ a common factor. The proof for any other row or 
column may be carried out in the same way. 

5. A third order determinant is equal to zero if two of its 
parallel lines (rows or columns) read alike, that is, if all pairs 
of corresponding elements in two parallel lines are equal to each 
other. 

This follows at once from Theorem 2. For, let us denote by D the de- 
terminant under consideration. If we interchange the two lines which 
read alike we should find, according to Theorem 2, a new determinant 
D' such that 



(1) 



D' =- D. 



But since the interchanged elements are equal in value, we must also 
have 

(2) D' = D. 

But from (1) and (2) we conclude by addition* 

D' = D = Q). 

6. If every element of any rotv or column is expressed as a 
sum of tii'o terms, the determinant may be expressed as a sum 
of two determinants, thns

To prove this, expand the determinant on the left according to the 
elements of the first column. A similar proof will establish the theorem 
for any column or row. 

7. If to the elements of any row or column we add the cor- 
respondin(/ elements of a parallel rotv or column^ multiplied hy 
one and the same factor, the value of the determinant is not 
changed.

and the second determinant of the right member is equal to zero on ac- 
count of Theorem .3. This actually proves Theorem 7 for the first and 
second columns. All other cases may be proved in the same fashion. 

8. If the elements of any rotv or column he multiplied hy 
their respective cof actors, the sum of the products ohtained in 
this ivay is equal to the value of the determinant. 

This is merely a restatement of equations (1) of Art. 207. 

9. If the elements of any roiv or column he multiplied hy the 
cofactors of the corresponding elements of a parallel row or 
column, the sum of these products is equal to zero. 

Proof. We know, for instance, according to Theorem 8, that 
(3) a^A^ + a^A^ + a^A^ = 



Now b^A^ + h^Aâ€ž + ^g.lg is obtained from tlie left member of (3) by re-

siuce the second determinant in (1) may be obtained from the first by 
multiplying the elements of the second row by - 2 and adding to the 
corresponding elements of the first row (Theorem 7, Art. 208). But 
the third determinant in (1) is equal to zero, since the elements in its

of its third row (Theorems 4 and 5, Art. 208). Therefore

Proof. The determinant will vanish if a = ft, or if ft = c, or if c = a 
(Theorem 5, Art. 208). Therefore it has a â€” b, h â€” c, and c â€” a as factors. 
(See Factor Theorem, Art. 84.) But the product (a â€” b)(b â€” c)(c â€” n) 
and the expanded determinant are integral rational functions of a, ft, r, 
of the same (the third) degree. Therefore the determinant can differ 
from this product merely by a numerical factor L independent of a, ft, 
and c.

the determinant D. (See Art. 207 for definition of cofactors.) Let us 
multiply both members of (1) by Ai, both members of (2) by A2, both 
members of (3) by .I3, and add. AVe shall find, after collecting terms,

210. Homogeneous equations. If the equations (1), (2), 
(3) of Art. 20*J are homogeneous, that is, if r ^ = rg = rg = 0, 
and if their determinant D is different from zero, equations 
(8) of Art. 209 and Theorem 2 of Art. 208 show that the 
only solution of (1), (2), (3) is the obvious one x = y = z = 0. 
It would be quite improper to draw the same conclusion in 
the case where D is equal to zero, since equations (8) of 
Art. 209 do not admit of division by D in this case. (See 
Art. 21.) What actually takes place in this case is ex- 
pressed by the latter part of the following theorem, which 
covers both the case when i) ^ 0, and i> = 0.

Proof, ^^'e have settled the case D =fz O already. Let us as.siime 
therefore that D is equal to zero, but that not all of the second order 
minors of D are equal to zero. There will then exist at least one second 
order minor of D which is not equal to zero. Let us assume in partic- 
ular that 



t>2 ^2

does not vanish. We may then solve equations (2) and (3) for y and 
z in terms of r, as in Art. 206, thus obtaining equations (5) of Art. 20G, 
where, however, we now have to put ?-j = r., = 0. If we take account of 
this, and make use of the notation introduced in Art. 207 for the co- 
factors of the various elements of D, we find that these equations (the 
equations (")) of Art. 206) reduce to 

A^y = B^r and A f = C\x, 
whence 

(4) 2/ = ^-^-^ ^ = ^^- 

.4, A, 

These values of 1/ and z will satisfy equations (2) and (3), no matter 
what value be given to x. But they will also satisfy (1). For if we 
substitute the values (4) of // and ~ into the left nieni])er of (1), we find 

a^x + h^ii + c^z â€” a^x + h^^x + r, ^ ' j; 
- ' 1 â€¢ M 

= â€” {a\A 1 -1- bilii + <\C\)x - â€” .r, 
-'1 '1 

and this is equal to zero, no matter what value x may have, since D is 
equal to zero by hypothesis. 

Since equations (4) give a solution of (1), (2), (3), no matter what 
value be given to x, we see that there exist in this case infinitely many 
solutions of the tlii-ee given equations, as our theorem asserts. 

Our proof was based 011 the assumption that A^ is not 
equal to zero. It is easy to see how the proof should be 



346 LINEAR EQUATIONS AND DETERMINANTS [Art. 211 

modified if A^ is equal to zero, provided that there exists 
some otlier second order minor of D which is not equal to 
zero. We may, in fact, state our theorem a little more 
precisely as follows: 

If the determinant D of the homogeneous equations (1), (2), 
(3) is equal to zero, hut if there exists at least one second order 
minor in D which does not vanish, theji there exist infinitely 
many solutions of (1), (2), (3), hut the ratios of the three un- 
knowns, X, y, z, will he determined uniquely hy these equations. 

For instance, if ^4^ ^ 0, equations (4) show that these ratios are 
y -.x - B^.A^, z: X - C-^-.yi-^, 
x:y:z = A^:B,:C\. 

If i) = 0, and if, besides, all of the second order. minors of 
D are equal to zero, it may be shown that two of the three 
unknowns, x, y, z, may be chosen arbitrarily. In this case 
the ratios x : y : z are not determined uniquely. 

Our method of proof showed us that, in the case D = 0, 
any solution of two of the three equations would also satisfy 
the third. We may express this by saying that the three 
equations are not independerit ivhen D is equal to zero. In the 
case when J) = 0, and when, besides, all of the second order 
minors of D are equal to zero, any solution of one of the 
equations satisfies both of the others. In this case, then, two 
of the three equations (1), (2), (3) are mere multiples of the 
third, and the three equations taken together convey no more 
information about the unknown quantities than a single 
equation. 

211. An application of linear equations in chemistry. There 
are certain substances like iron, silver, lead, sulphur, hydro.- 
gen, oxygen, chlorine, etc., which chemists have not been, 
able to separate into other constituents, and which they call 
elements. Very frequently several elements occur in a mix- 
ture which may contain its various constituent parts in any 
proportion. Thus pulverized iron and pulverized sulphur 



Art. 211] LINEAR EQUATIONS IN CHEMISTRY 347 

may be mixed in aii}' [H'oportion, but the various particles 
are still recognizable as iron or sulphur particles. If heat be 
applied, some of the iron and sulphur particles will combine 
to form a new substance which is essentiall}^ different in kind 
from both of its component elements, and which is said to be 
a chemical combination or compound of iron and sulphur. 

It is a fundamental fact of chemistry that the elements enter 
into chemical combinations only in certain fixed proportions, 
while in a mixture the proportions may be any whatever. 

For instance, one gram of hydrogen (chemical symbol H) 
will combine with 35.4 grams of chlorine (chemical symbol CI) 
to form 86.4 grams of hydrochloric acid (HCl). If the vessel 
in which the reaction takes place should contain just one 
gram of hydrogen and more than the proper amount of 
chlorine, only 35.4 grams of the chlorine will be used up. 
The rest will remain unchanged. This reaction is repre- 
sented by the chemical equation 

H + CI = HCl. 

To account for the law of fixed proportions, the English 
physicist and chemist Dalton (1766-1844) proposed the 
following theory. A gram of hydrogen contains a certain 
very large number of exceedingly minute particles called 
atoms. Similarly, the chlorine in the vessel is composed of 
atoms of chlorine. Each atom of hj-drogen combines with 
one atom of chlorine to form a smallest particle, called a 
molecule, of the compound. If all of the material is used up, 
there is one atom of hydrogen combined with every atom of 
chlorine, and the law of fixed proportion will be accounted 
for if we assume that all hydrogen atoms have the same 
weight, and that every chlorine atom weighs 35.4 as much as 
a hydrogen atom. 

Every chemical reaction is capable of a similar interpreta- 
tion, and as a result of a systematic study of all the elements 
and their compounds, chemists have come to attribute to 
every element a number, called its atomic weight. The 
atomic weight of an element tells* us how the weight of an 



348 LINEAR EQUATIONS AND DETERMINANTS [Ain. 211 

atom of that element compares with that of a hydrogen atom. 
Thus the atomic weight of chlorine is 35.4, as determined by 
the reaction which was described above. 

These atomic weights are sometimes called relative atomic 
weights. They do not teach us how heavy any atom really 
is. When we say that an element has the relative atomic 
weight jw, Ave only mean that one of its atoms weighs p times 
as much as a hydrogen atom. If the absolute weight of a 
hydrogen atom (expressed in grams) is w grams, the absolute 
weight of an atom of this other kind will then be pw grams. 

Let us now consider three elements A^ B, and P, whose 
relative atomic weights are a, b, and p respectively, and let 
AP and BP be two chemical combinations the molecule of 
each of which contains only one atom of each constituent. 
Suppose that we have a mixture of the two compounds AP 
and BP, and that we know the total weight g (in grams) 
of the mixture, and also the weight h of the element P which 
is present in the mixture. We can then calculate the amount 
present in the mixture of each of the two compounds AP and 
BP. 

The solution of this problem is known as indirect analysis 
of the mixture, and is often of practical importance. For it 
is easy to hud g the total weight of the mixture, and in many- 
cases it is easy to lind the amount h of the element P, while 
it may be very difficult to separate the elements A and B by 
chemical means and to determine their weights directly. 

To solve the problem we proceed as follows : Let us 
denote by x and y the number of grams present in the mix- 
ture of the compounds AP and BP respectively. Then of 
course 

(1) ^ + y = 9^ 

since g represents the total weight of the mixture. 

Let w be the weight (in grams) of a hydrogen atom. 
Then an atom of A weighs aw grams, one of B weighs hw 
grams, and one of P weighs pw grams. Consequently a 
molecule of AP weighs at<;+jow or (a + jt?)M'grams, and there 



Art. 211] LINEAR EQUATIONS IN CHEMISTRY 349 

are x I {a + p^iv molecules of AP and 7/ / {b + p)w molecules 
of BP in the mixture. Again, since there are h grams of 
the element P in the mixture and since each atom of P 
weighs pw grams, there are h/pw atoms of P in the mixture. 
But there is one and only one of these atoms in every molecule 
of AP and BP. Therefore the number of molecules of ^P 
and BP taken together must be equal to the number of atoms 
of P ; that is 

X _,_ y ^ A 

{a-\-p^w {b + p)w pw^ 
whence, multiplying both members by w, 

(2) ^ 1- y =^. 

a+p b+p p 

Thus, we have found two equations, (1) and (2), for our two 
unknowns. We may write them as follows, 

(3) I ^ + y = 9^ 

\p(b +p)x-\-p(a +p)i/=(a+p^(b +p}h. 
The determinant of the coefficients of x and 1/ is 
1 1 

p{h+p'). lK(^+p) 
Consequently this determinant will be different from zero 
whenever a is different from J, and it will actually be possi- 
ble to solve (3) for the two unknowns. The result is 

p aâ€” b p a â€” b 

Illustrative example. A mixture composed of sodium chloride (NaCl) 
and potassium chloride (KCl) was found to weigh 3 grams. The com- 
pounds were then decomposed and tlie amount of chlorine was found to 
be 1.7 grams. Find the amount of NaCl and of KCl present in the 
original mixture. 

The atomic weights in this case are a =39.1 for potassium (K), i = 23

h = 1.7. Substitution of these numbers in formulas (i) gives (to the 
nearest tenth of a gram) 

X = 0.9 gram, // = 2.1 grams,

350 LINEAR EQUATIONS AND DETERMINANTS [Art. 212 

212. Generalization to systems of n linear equations with n 
unknowns. The attempt to generalize the methods of this 
chapter to the case of n equations with n unknowns, leads 
to the introduction of determinants of the nth order. This 
might be done by the method of mathematical induction. 
(See Arts. 84 and 88.) But a more elegant treatment of 
this subject may be based on the theory of permutations, 
which is also important from many other points of view. 
We shall therefore reserve the discussion of w linear equa- 
tions with n unknowns for Chapter XII, devoting the next 
two chapters to some of the numerous questions concerned 
with permutations and combinations and the theory of 
probability.

CHAPTER X 

PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 

213. The notion of order. If we have n elements of any 
kind such as numbers, letters, chairs, tables, animals, or per- 
sons, we may think of these n elements as being arranged 
along a straight line. In any such arrangement we shall 
speak of one of the elements as the first, another as the 
second, and so on. Any arrangement of this sort differs 
from any other arrangement of the same elements merely in 
the order in which the various elements are thought of, not 
in the total number of elements included in the arrangement. 

214. Permutations. Each of the various ordered arrange- 
ments tvhich can be made of n elements is called a permutation 
of these elements. The principal problem which we shall 
have to solve is this : how many permutations are there 
of n elements, if each of the elements occurs in each 
permutation ? 

Clearly a single element can be arranged in one way only. If we 
have two elements, let us represent them by the letters a and h.* There 
are clearly two arrangeinents and only two in this case; namely a first 
one with a in the first place and h in the second, and a second arrange- 
ment with h in the first place and a in the second. We may represent 
these two arrangements symbolically as follows : ab and ha. 
In the case of three elements, a, b, and c, there are 
Two arrangements, ahc and ach, in which a occupies the first place. 
Two arrangements, bac and bco, in which b occupies the first place. 
Two arrangements, cab and dm, in which c occupies the first place, 
or 3 . 2 = 6 arrangements altogether. Thus there are six permutations 
of three elements. 

* This is somewhat of a departure from our general practice. So far we have 
used the letters a and b only to stand for numbers. In this connection, however, 
a and b may represent two different persons, two animals, or two elements of any 
kind. 

352 



Art. 214] PERMUTATIONS OF n ELEMENTS 353 

Let us consider the case of four elements, a, b, c, d. By our previous 
argument there are six permutations in which a occupies the first place. 
For, after a has been put into tlie first place there remain three other 
elements, 6, c, r/, which may be permuted among the remaining places. 
Similarly there are six permutations witli h in the first place, six with c 
in the first place, and six with tl in the first place, or 4 x 6 = 24 permu- 
tations in all. 

Let us now pass to the general case. We denote the n 
elements by 

(1) a^, a^. Â«3, .â€¢â€¢ aâ€ž, 

and we use the symbol Pâ€ž to denote the number of permutations 
of these n elements. 

If we omit any one of the elements (1) there are n â€” 1 
left, and the number of permutations of these nâ€” 1 elements 
will be represented by the symbol Pâ€ž_j. Now all of the 
permutations of a^, a^. â€¢â€¢â€¢, a^ may be divided into n classses 
according as a^, or Â«2i ^^i' Â«3' â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢> or aâ€ž, occupies the first place. 
The number of permutations in any one of these classes is 
represented by tlie symbol Pn-\- I' or, the first element 
having been fixed, there are onl}^ n â€” 1 elements left to be 
arranged. Since there are n such classes, there will be n 
times Pn-i permutations in all. But we have denoted the 
total number of permutations of n elements by Pâ€ž. There- 
fore we must have 

(2) P,, = nP^_y 

We have found already 
Pj = l, P2 = l-2, ^3= 1.2. 3 = 6, P4 = 1.2.3.4 = 24. 

By using (2) we now find 

P^ = .5P4 = 1 â€¢ 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 = 120, Pg = 1.2. 3. 4. 5. 6 = 720, 

suggesting the general formula 

(3) Pâ€ž = l .2.3.4. ..w. 

The product of all of the integers from 1 to w, which makes 
its appearance here, is called factorial n, and is usually de- 



354 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS [Art. 215 

noted by one of the two symbols n ! or \n. Thus (3) be- 
comes 
(4) Pn = n ! (read P sub n is equal to factorial ti). 

To complete the proof of this formula, we use the method 

of mathematical induction. We know that (4) is correct 

for w = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We can prove that if (4) is correct 

for n = k^ then it ivill also be correct for n= k+ 1. 

In fact, if 

P, = ;^! = 1.2.3...yt, 

then, according to (2), 

P,^^=(k+l)P, = kl(k+l)=1.2.S:.k.k+l={k + l^U 

tlius proving our assertion, and consequently the validity of 
(4) for all values of w. 

215. The number of permutations of n elements taken k at 
a time. Suppose again that we have w elements a^, ag^ â€¢*â€¢ ^w 
and let us examine in how many ways these may be arranged 
in groups of k elements each, where k S w? attention being 
given to the order of the arrangement in each of the groups 
of k elements. 

The following is a concrete problem of this sort. There are 25 base- 
ball players in a college (n = 25). Each of them is willing to take any 
position on the college team composed of nine players {k = 9). In how 
many ways can the team be formed? 

Each of the required permutations is composed of k ele- 
ments. The first place may be filled in n ways, since it 
may be occupied by any one of the n elements. After 
the first place has been filled there are only n â€” 1 ways of 
filling the second place. Thus the first two places may 
be filled in w(w â€” 1) different ways. There are 7i â€” 2 
elements still available for filling the third place, so that 
the first three places may be filled in n{n â€” 1) (w â€” 2) 
ways. If we continue this argument we see that the k 
places may be filled in n(n â€” l)(w â€” 2) â€¢â€¢â€¢ (ri â€” A; + 1) dif- 
ferent ways. 



Art. 215] n ELEMENTS k AT A TIME 355 

Let us now use the symbol â€žPt to,denote the number of per- 
mutations of n elements taken k at a time. We have found 

(1) â€žP, = n(w - l)(w _ 2) ... (n - y^ + 1), 

the right member being a product of k factors, namely of 
n â€” 0, n â€” 1, n â€” 2, â€¢â€¢â€¢ n â€” (k â€” 1). 

Of course for k = n, we find, as in Art. 214, 

Since we may write 
nl=n(n-l}(H-2^ ... (n-k + l)(n-^^(n-k-l) ...2.1, 

and since the product of the first k factors in the right 
member is â€žPfc, while the product of the remaining n â€” k 
factors is Qn â€” ^) !, we have 

n\ = ^P,(n-ky., 
whence 

n !

or two, or three, â€¢â€¢â€¢, or as many as r of these things? 

11. How many signals, composed of one, two, or three flags can be 
formed from five different flags ? 

216. Circular arrangements. The notion of order which 
we introduced in Art. 213 may be called more specifically 
linear order, since it is suggested by the arrangement of n 
objects placed in a row, or on a straight line. If the n 
objects are instead placed on the circumference of a circle, 
or on any other simple closed curve, we may adopt the point 
of view that, in such a circular arrangement, it is unnatural 
to fix upon any one of the elements, rather than upon any 
other one, as being the first. 

Thus, in Fig. 69, we may consider that the three points 
A, B, C have the same circular order whether we start from 
A and then proceed in the order ABC, or 
wliether we start from B and proceed in 
order to and A, or finally whether we 
start from O and proceed in the order CAB. 
Thus, although there are six permutations of 
these three elements, there are only two cir- 
cular permutations. In one of these permu- 
tations we go around the circle in clockwise fasliion ; and 
the other order may be described as a counter-clockwise 
arrangement. 

In general, if we wish to arrange n elements in circular order, 
we may place any one of the elements in a fixed position and 
leave it there. The remaining elements can then be arranged 
in (rtâ€” 1)! different ways. Therefore, there are (w â€” 1) ! 
circular permutations of n elements. In some cases there are 
pairs of clockwise and counter-clockwise arrangements which 
are indistinguishable; namely, whenever it is admissible to 
turn the circle around a diameter through an angle of 180Â°. 
In such cases the number of arrangements reduces to ^(wâ€” 1) I.

5. If we have Â« beads of different colors to form a bracelet, how many 
distinguishable arrangements are possible? 

217. Permutations when all of the elements are not distinct. 

It happens quite frequently that the elements which are to 
be arranged are not distinct. Such is the case, for instance, 
if we wish to answer the following question. How many 
distinct words of eight letters each can be formed from the 
letters i, Z, ?, i, n, o, ^, s ? There will not be as many as 8 !, 
because several of the 8 I permutations of these eight letters 
will give rise to the same word, since there are three I's and 
two Vs. 

The general question is easily answered. Among the n 
symbols which are to be arranged, let us suppose that a 
occurs r times, b occurs s times, c occurs t times, and so on. 
We find it convenient, for the purpose of our proof, to write 
aj, rTg, ^3, â€¢â€¢â€¢, a^ for the r symbols a ; b-^, b^. â€¢â€¢â€¢, b^ for the s sym- 
bols b ; and so on. Thus we have 

r symbols a^, a^, â€¢â€¢â€¢, a^, each of which means the same as a, 
(1)8 symbols b^, b^, â€¢â€¢â€¢, 6,, each of which means the same as b, 
t symbols c^, c^^ â€¢â€¢â€¢, c^, each of which means the same as c, 
etc. etc. 

Since there are w symbols all together (counting repetitions), 
we have n = r + s + t -\- â– â– â– .^ 



358 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS [Art. 217 

and there are n ! permutations of w symbols. But not all 
of the n ! permutations will be distinct. Let X be the 
number of these permutations which are distinct, and let 
us imagine that all of these X permutations have been 
written down. 

From each of these X distinct permutations we can obtain 
r ! permutations by interchanging the r symbols a, leaving 
the 5's, c's, etc., fixed. We obtain in this way X â€¢ r\ arrange- 
ments. From each of these we can obtain s ! arrangements 
by permuting the 6's, leaving the Â«'s, c's, etc., fixed. This 
gives rise to X â–  r\ s\ arrangements. Proceeding in this 
way, we find that the total number of arrangements will be 

Xrlsltl-.' . 

But, since there are n symbols all together, the total number 
of arrangements is also equal to m !. Therefore 

X 'r\s\t\ -" =n\, or 



(2) X =

Consequently, (2) gives the number of distinct permutations 
of n elements, r of which are a's, s of which are b's, t of which 
are c''s, and so on.

Aim. 218] TWO CLASSES OF PERMUTATIONS 359 

5. Piove the following theorem. // there are n distinct elements 
Ou Â«2> â€¢â€¢â€¢) oâ€ž, which are to be arranged in sets of r elements at a time, and if 
it be permitted that each element be repeated as often as r times, then there 
are n'' permutations. 

218. Two classes of permutations. It happens frequently 
that some particular arrangement of 7i elements is regarded 
as more important or more natural than any other. Thus, 
if the elements under consideration are the n numbers 1, 2, 
3, â€¢â€¢â€¢, w, we naturally think of the smallest number first and 
then arrange the others in the order of increasing magni- 
tude. If the elements are letters a, b, c, d, â€¢â€¢-, we naturally 
tliink of their alphabetic order as^being the most important. 

Whenever, for ayiy reason, one of the n ! permutations of n 
symbols is to be regarded as more important than any other, we 
call it the principal permutation. 

Let X, c, m, y, b, â€¢â€¢â€¢ be tlie principal permutation of a sys- 
tem of n symbols. We may rename x and call it aj, rename 
c and call it a^, and so on. Thus, by changing the names of 
the elements, if necessary, we cati always fix our notation in 
such a ruay that the principal permutation will assume the 

form 

rtj a^a^ â€¢â€¢â€¢ rtâ€ž 

in ivhich the subscripts 1, 2, 3, â€¢â€¢â€¢, n appear in their natural 
order. 

In every other permutation of w elements a^, â€¢â€¢â€¢, aâ€ž, some 
of the lower subscripts will be preceded by a higher one. 
Every instance of this kind is called an inversion. By the 
number of inversions in a permutation we mean the total number 
of instances in ndiich a loiver subscript is preceded, in that per- 
mutation, by a higher one. 

Thus, in the permutation 23514G7 of the numbers from 1 to 7, there are 
four inversions. 1 is preceded by 2, 3, 5 (3 inversions). Neither 2 nor 3 is 
preceded by a higher number. 4 is preceded by 5 (1 inversion). 5, 6, 7 
are not preceded by higher numbers. Thus there are 3 + 1 = 4 inversions. 

A permutation is called even or odd according as it contains 
an even or an odd number of inversions. 



360 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS [Art. 218 

The principal permutation contains no inversions and is regarded as 
an even permutation, thus leading ns to classify zero as an even number. 

Theorem 1. If any two elements of a permutation are in- 
terchanged^ the class of the pefmutation tvill he changed from 
even to odd, or vice versa. 

Proof. Let us begin with the case in wliich a pair of adjacent elements 
are intei-changed. Let these adjacent elements be called a^ and a^ and 
suppose that /i< ^â€¢. We may represent by a single letter .1 the collec- 
tion of all of the elements of the permutation which precede the pair 
QhOki and by B the collection of all those elements which follow Offlif. 
If the original permutation was 

(1) Aa^akB, h < k, 

the second one, after the interchange of o^ and a^., will be 

(2) AakOhB, h < A-. 

In both of these permutations every element of A, and also every ele- 
ment of B, is preceded by exactly the same elements, and therefore by 
the same number of elements with higher subscripts. But in (2) a^ is 
l^receded by a/c (/; < k). Therefore (2) contains one more inversion 
than (1). 

If, instead, Aaua^B was the oi'iginal permutation, and Aa^akB the 
second one, we see by the same argument that the second permutation 
contains one inversion less than the original one. In either case, the 
number of inversions is changed by one, and therefore the class of the 
permutation is changed from even to odd or vice versa. 

If the two elements, o^ and Uk, which axe to be interchanged are not adja- 
cent, we may proceed as follows: Let there be m elements, ci, C2, â– â– â€¢, râ€žâ€ž 
between a^ and a^, so that the original permutation may be represented by 

(;3) Aa!,CiC2 â€¢â€¢â€¢ CmOkB, 

where A represents the collection of elements which precede a^, and B 
the collection of elements which follow aa.-. We can accomplish the 
interchange of Â«/, and rtt by a series of operations each of which con- 
sists in merely interchanging adjacent elements. Thus, we obtain, in 
order, the following permutations : 

AayfivCiCz â€¢â€¢â€¢ c^-iCmakB, the original permutation, 
Acia^^C2C:i â€¢â€¢â€¢ Cm-iCmakB, result of 1st operation, 
AcidtthCs â€¢â– â€¢ Cm-iCmCikB, result of 2d operation. 



AciC2CsCi â€¢â€¢â€¢ ('m-i'^'hCm.(ikB, result of m â€” 1th operation, 
Aciczc^d â€¢â€¢â€¢ c,n-\câ€ž/iiflkB, result of mth operation. 
Acic-zCzCi â€¢â€¢â€¢ Cm-ic^QkahB, result of m + 1th operation. 



Art. lMO] COMBINATIONS 361 

After these m + 1 operations, Uh actually occupies the place originally 
occupied by a,;. But a^t is not yet in the place originally occupied by o^. 
To get it into that place, we change the last of the above permutations 
by interchanging a^ and câ€ž, giving the new permutation 

Ac^c.fiC^ â€¢â– â€¢ QkC^ahB. 

As a result of m operations of this kind, we finally obtain the desired 

permutation 

(4) AokC^c.^ â€¢â€¢â€¢ câ€žahB. 

Thus, the interchange of o/, and Uk is equivalent to ( Â»?+ \) + m â€” 1 m 
+ 1 interchanges of adjacent elements. Since each of these interchanges 
changes the class of the permutation from even to odd, or vice versa, 
and since 2 m + 1 is an odd integer, the total effect of interchanging a^ 
and flfc will be to change the class of the permutation, and we have 
proved our theorem. We may also state this same theorem as follows: 

Theorem 2. The interchange of any two elements of a per- 
mutation changes the number of inversions by an odd integer. 

Let us think of a list composed of all of the n ! permutations of n 
elements. If we intei'change any two of the elements, say the first and 
second, in every one of these permutations, the list, after this change has 
been made, will still include all of the permutations but not in the origi- 
nal order. For two permutations different from each other before the 
change will also be different from each other after the change. But by 
this change every even permutation is converted into an odd one and 
vice versa. Hence the number of even permutations must be equal to 
the number of odd permutations. This gives the following theorem. 

Theorem 3. Of the total number (n!) of permutations of 
n elements, one half are even and the other half are odd. 

These theorems are of great importance in the theory of 
determinants of the ni\\ order. (See Chapter XII.)

tion being given to the order in which they may be arranged, 
is called a combination of the n elements. 

Thus out of three elements, a, h, c, we can form three combinations if 
we take two at a time ; namely be, ca, and ab. The combinations be and 
cb are the same, since no attention is to be paid to the order or arrange- 
ment of the elements, although the permutations be and eb are different. 

We have denoted by ^Pk the number of permutations of 
n elements takmg k of them at a time. Let us denote simi- 
larly by J^C^. the number of combinations of n elements taken 
A; at a time. From each of these combinations we can form 
h ! permutations by writing the k elements of the combina- 
tion in their k ! different orders. Consequently we have 

SO that we find 

(1) nOk = '^= ''â€¢

if we make use of formula (2) of Art. 215. This formula 
may also be written as follows

C^; n^k- ^^ ^, 

on account of (1), Art. 215. 

Whenever we select k elements out of a total number of 
n elements, there are n â€” k left. Consequently, to every 
combination of n elements taken ^ at a time, there corre- 
sponds just one combination of the n elements taken n â€” k 
at a time. There must exist, therefore, just as many com- 
binations taken ^ at a time, as there are combinations taking 
n â€” k at a time, that is, it must be so that

a formula which may also be verified directly by means of 
(1) or (2). 

Of course, we have in particular 

(4) nC-'i=â€žCâ€ž_i = 7l, 

and 

(5) â€ž(7. = 1, 



Art. 220] INDEPENDENT COMBINATIONS 363 

since there is only one combination of n things taken all 
together. The application of formula (3) in this case 
would give 

and we shall occasionally, as a mere matter of convenience, 
make use of this formula although, from our original point 
of view, combinations which contain no element were not 
contemplated. 

In deducing formula (1) we assumed that the elements 
which were to be combined were all different from each 
other. The formula, of course, undergoes a modification 
if some of the elements are alike. 

220. Independent combinations. The following problem 
in combinations arises frequently. There are Â« classes of 
elements of which 

the 1st class contains a elements, 
the 2d class contains h elements, 
the 3d class contains c elements, 
etc. etc. etc. 

We are to form combinations of s elements by picking out 
one element and only one out of each class. In how many 
ways may this be done? 

We select any one of the elements of the first class, any 
one of the second class, any one of the third class, and so on. 
Clearly there are i 

different ways of doing this. 

In particular, if each of the Â« classes contains the same 
number a of elements, the number of combinations is a'.

for â€ž(7^ is precisely the same as the expression (2) of Art. 88 
for tlie coefficient of rc"~V' in the expansion of (x + a)". 
Of course this agreement is not a mere accident. In fact, 
we shall now give a new proof of the binomial theorem based 
on the theory of combinations. 

Let us consider n binomials .r + f7i, x + a-y, â– â– â€¢. x -\- aâ€ž and let us form 
their product, 
(1) (.r + (t\){x+ n.^ â€¢â€¢â€¢ (.r + Â«â€ž)â€¢

rational function of x, of degree n. The complete product will be the 
sum of all of the partial products which can be obtained by selecting 
one and only one term from each of the binomial factors of (1), and 
nniltiplying these together. In order that such a partial product may 
contain exactly the (n â€” ^â€¢)th power of x (no higher and no lower power) 
as a factor, n â€” k of the factors of the partial product must be x's, and the 
other k factors must be a's. Consequently, there will be as many partial

CHAPTER XI 

PROBABILITY 

223. Definition of Probability. As our knowledge of 
Natui-e becomes deeper and more extensive, we become more 
and more convinced that tlie laws of Nature are permanent 
and universal and that, in the strictest sense of the word, 
there is no such thing as chance. Nevertheless there are 
many phenomena which may be studied from the point of 
view of chance. Thus, if we toss a coin, it is quite evident 
that the peculiar way in which we toss it will cause it to 
land either head or tail and that the result, whether head or 
tail, is really determined by our method of tossing and the 
laws of mechanics. But these laws are difficult to apply to 
any specific instance of this sort, and a very slight impercep- 
tible change in our method of tossing would change the 
result. We therefore profess complete ignorance of the 
causes which govern the process of tossing coins, and say 
that the two possible results, head or tail, are equally likely 
or equally probable, and that the probability of tossing a 
head is equal to |. Again, if a bag contains three white and 
seven black balls, and if we draw out a ball at random, we 
say that the probability of drawing a white ball is -j^^, since 
there are three chances out of ten for this. 

In all such cases, to use general language, we estimate the 
probability of an event. In the above illustrations, the 
event is either the appearance of a head after the coin has 
been tossed, or the appearance of a white ball as a result of 
the drawing. By a trial we mean any operation which gives 
the event an opportunity to happen. In our illustrations 
the tossing of the coin, or the act of drawing a ball from the 
bag, are trials. 

366 



Art. 223] DEFINITION OF PROBABILITY 367 

In estimating the probability/ of an event, it is very important, 
first of all, to decide which ones of the various possibilities are 
to be regarded as equally probable. 

Thus in tossing a coin tliere is no reason to suppose that one side will 
turn up rather than the other. Consequently we say that the probability 
of a toss resulting head is ^, and the probability for tail is also |. 

But suppose we aie tossing two coins. Either face of either coin may 
turn up, giving 2 x '2 = i possibilities. We might be led to conclude 
that a double head would be just as likely as a combination of head on 
one coin and tail on the other. But this would be erroneous. For a 
double head is only one of four possible cases, so that its probability is |. 
But there are two chances out of four for a combination head-tail, since 
we obtain such a result in both of the following cases : (1) the first coin 
lands head and the second tail, (2) the second coin lands head and the 
first lands tail. Thus, the probability of tossing head-tail with two coins 
is I or |. 

Suppose we have made a list of all of the results which mag 
possibly apjjear when we make a trial, and that each of these 
results is as likely as any other. Let us call each of these 
possibilities a case, and let there be m + n cases all together. 
Suppose that m of these cases are favorable to the event under 
consideration ; that is, let ^ls suppose that each of the m cases 
makes it certain that the event will happen. Let us suppose 
further that each of the remaining n cases is unfavorable, that 
is, makes it certain that the event will not happen. Then ice 
say that the probability of the event is 

.^ . m 

the ratio of the favorable to all possible eases. 

The probability that the event will not happen is 



(2) 


p' =^^1â€” 
m + n 


so that 




(3) 


p + p'=l, 


(â€¢i) 


p'=l-p. 



368 PROBABILITY [Art. 224 

Therefore, the sum of the probability that an event will happen 
and the probability that it will fail is equal to unity. 

If all possible cases are favorable, then w = so that, 
according to (1), we have p = 1. If all possible cases are 
unfavorable, then ^ = 0. In all other cases p is a positive 
proper fraction. Consequently the probability of an event is 
always a positive proper fraction unless we are certain either 
that the event will happen or else that it will fail. Tlie prob- 
ability of an event which is certain to happen is equal to 
unity; that of an event which is sure to fail is equal to zero.

8. If three dice are thrown, what are the probabilities of throwing

224. Compound events. It is frequently convenient to 
think of an event as being composed of several simpler 
events. 

Thus, if we are tossing two coins, we may i^refer to think of what hap- 
l)ens (head or tail) when we toss each of the coins separately, and speak 
of the result of tossing the two coins together as a compound event. 

But whenever we decompose any event whose probability 
is to be computed into simpler events, it is very important 
to know wliether the component simpler events are independ- 
ent, dependent, or exclusive. 



Akt. 2-H] COMPOUND EVENTS 369 

Two or more events are said to be independent or dependent, 
aecording as the occurrence of one of them at a given trial does 
not or does affect the prohahility of the others. 

Suppose we are drawiug two balls out of a bag containing three white 
and seven black balls. We may decompose this process into two separate 
drawings of one ball at a time. The probability of a white ball at the 
first drawing is y*j. But if we have actually drawn a white ball, the 
probability of a white ball at the second drawing will be |. If the 
first ball had been black, the probability of a white ball at the second 
drawing would be |. Thus the probability of having the second drawing 
result in a white ball is aifected by the result of the first drawing. 

If instead tlie balls are returned to the bag after each drawing, the 
probability of a white ball will be the same at each trial. In this case, 
the event of drawing a second white ball would be independent of the 
event of drawing a first white ball. 

Two or more events are said to he exclusive if only one of 
them can happen. 

For instance the two events of a single coin landing head and landing 
tail at a single toss are exclusive. Either may happen, but not both. 

If |)j, p.^, â€¢â€¢'-, Pn <^>'^ the probabilities of n independent events, 
the prohahility that all of these events will happen together, at a 
given trial, is 

(1) P=PlP'i-' Pn^ 

the product of their separate probabilities. 

Proof. Let us suppose that there are two events only. Let there be 
rtj cases favorable to the first event and />j which are unfavorable. Then 
the probability of the first event is 



Pi = 



ij_ 



Oj + i, 
Similarly we shall have 

^2 = â€” fr 

if aâ€ž cases are favorable to the second event, and ^2 are unfavorable. Since 
the events are independent, both of them will happen together in a.^a.2^ 
cases out of a total number of (ai + h\)(^a-i + b-i) cases, thus giving 

, n^aâ€ž 



370 PROBABILITY [Art. 224 

as the probability that both may happen together. We may now regard 
the combination of these two events as a single event of a probability p'. 
The probability that a third independent event of probability /jg may also 
happen will therefore be 

P' Pz = PiP-.Pz- 

If we continue to reason in this way, we finally obtain (1) which was to 
be proved. 

We have a similar method for calculating the probability of a com- 
pound event which is composed of several dependent events. This 
method may be expressed by means of the same formula (1), but with a 
somewhat different meaning attached to the symbols pi, p.j, â€¢â€¢â€¢, joâ€ž, as ex- 
plained in the following theorem. 

Let p^ be the prohahility of a first event ; let p^ he the proba- 
bility of a second event after the first has happeiied ; let p^ be the 
probability of the third event after the first two have happened ; 
and so on. Then the probability that all of these events will 
occur together is 

(2) ^ = PiP2Ps---Pn- 

Proof. Let us suppose first that there are two events only. If there 
are a^ cases favorable and b^ cases unfavorable to the first event, we have 

Â«i 
pi- 



Â«i + ^1 

Now both events cannot happen together unless the first event happens. 
Consequently the cases which favor both events can be found only among 
the Oj cases which favor the first. If 62 of these cases favor the second 
event, the probability that both events will occur is 

P' = 



Oj + 61 



If the first event has actually happened, one of the a^ cases favorable to it 
must have occurred. Since b^ of these a^ cases are favorable to the second 
event, the probability of the latter, after the first has occurred, will be 

But we have 

I _ ^2 â€” ^1 ^2 _ 

thus proving our theorem in the case of two events. The extension to n 
events is made as in the proof of the preceding theorem. 



Art. 224] COMPOUND EVENTS 371 

The following theorem is concerned with mutually exclu- 
sive events. 

Let pi^ p^, â€¢â€¢â– ,Pn ^^ i^^ probabilities of n mutually exclusive 
events. The jj^'obabiHt// that one of these events (we care not 
which} will occur, is equal to the sum of their separate 
probabilities. 

Proof. Let there be m equally probable cases. Let ai of these be 
favorable to the first event, a., to the second event, and so on. Then 

a, aâ€ž (/â€ž 

â– ^' to' to to 

Since the events are mutually exclusive, the Â«, cases which favor the 
first event, the a.^ cases which favor the second event, and so on, must be 
entirely different from each other. Consequently there are just 
Â«i + flo + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + On cases among the m eqiuiUy jii-obable cases which are fa- 
vorable to one of these events, and the probability of one of these events is

372 PROBABILITY [Art. 225 

225. Repeated trials. If p denotes the prohahilitij that an 
event will happen on a single trials the prohahility that the event 
will happen exactly r times in n trials is equal to 

(1) ^CrpX^-py-'-. 

Proof. We separate the proof into three cases ; r = 0, 
r = 1, and the general case when r has any value. 

I. It r â€” 0, the event does not happen at all ; it must fail at each of 
the n trials. If p is the probability of the happening of the event at any 
trial, 1â€”p is the probability of its failing to happen (Art. 223). 
Therefore, since the n results which correspond to the n trials are inde- 
pendent, the probability of failure in all n trials is (1 â€” p)" (Art. 224). 

II. Let r = 1. If the event is to happen once and only once, it must 
happen at one trial and fail at the other n â€” L The probability of 
its happening at a specific one of these trials, say the first, and failing at 
the other n â€” 1, is jtÂ»(l â€” p)""^. (See Art. 224.) But since there is an 
equal opportunity for it to happen at each of the n trials, we find the 
value 

np(l â€” p)"~^ 

for the probability that the event will happen just once in n trials. 

III. The general case. In order that the event may happen exactly 
r times, it must happen on some combination of r trials and fail on the 
remaining n â€” r trials. The probability that the event may happen on 
any specific combination of r trials and fail on the remaining n â€” r is 

/)-(! - p)"--. (See Art. 224.) 

Since there are â€žC, combinations of r trials out of n, the probability that 
the event shall happen exactly r times in n trials is 

as stated in the theorem. 

Of course, on account of (3) of Art. 219, this is also equal to 

â€žCâ€ž_j;-(l -/))"-. 

In many cases we are interested in the question whether the event 
occurs at least r times in n trials rather than whether it occurs exartly r 
times in n trials. Such is the case, for instance, if a chess phiyer under- 
takes to win three games out of four. He will make good his intention 
if he wins either three or four games. 

The solution of the question is immediate. The event will happen at 
least r times, if it happens exactly n times, or n â€” 1 times, â€¢â– â€¢ , or r + 1 
times, or r times. Therefore (see Art. 224) the prnfxiJiillti/ Ihal nn ereiil

226. Application to life insurance. When a company 
insures a man's life it makes a contract with him according 
to which the company agrees to pay his heirs, after proof of 
death has been offered, a certain sum of money, in return for 
payments made by him to the company at certain stated 
intervals during his lifetime. These payments, called 
premiums, may be continued during the whole life of the 
insured person, or else for a stated number of years. The 
company undertakes a risk in each individual case, since 
the insured may die long before his premiums are sufficient 
to cover the sum for which the company is liable to his 
heirs. To put the insurance business on a sound basis it 
is necessary, therefore, to know what is the probability 
that a person of a certain age shall live a certain number 
of years. 

In order to be able to do this, actuaries have constructed 
so-called Tables of Mortality which are based on statistics. 
Suppose we make a record of 100,000 people at the age of 
25 and find that, at the end of a year 99,194 of them are still 
living. We should conclude from these data that the proba- 
bility of surviving one year, for a person 25 years of age, 
would be 99,194/100,000 = 0.992, The results obtained in 
this way become more reliable the greater the numlier of 
cases which have been taken into account. The Appendix 
contains such a table of mortality. 

The general i)rinciple, upon which this method of esti- 
mating probabilities is founded, may be formulated as 
follows : 



374 PROBABILITY [Art. 226 

If n is a very large number and if observations show that a 
certain event has happened m times in n possible cases, the 
probability of this event is equated to m/n. In other words, 
the assumption is made that at the next opportunity the event 
will again happe7i m times out of a possible n. 

To find the probability p that a person of age a will live to 
age 5, we take from the table the number of persons living 
at age b and divide it by the number living at age a. 

If the insured person of age a promises to pay $ m per 
year until he is b years old, the value of this promise to the 
company may be calculated as follows : His first payment 
is certain, since the policy will not be in force until the first 
payment is made. The second payment is contingent upon 
his living at least one year. Let p^ be the probability for 
this, as obtained from the table of mortality. Then the 
value of the promise to pay I m at the end of the first year, 
or the value of the company's expectation is estimated to be 
$7wpj. Similarly the value of the company's expectation 
for the third premium of I m is f mp^i if P2 ^^ ^^^Â® probability 
that the insured will survive two years. These estimates 
are in accordance with the principle that the value of a prob- 
able payment (or the expectation) is equal to the sum to be 
paid midtiplied by the probability that it will be paid. 

Of course, in the case of life insurance the actual value, 
to the company, of each payment is really greater than in- 
dicated above. For the money is invested by the company 
and produces income. Therefore any complete solution of 
the question of the value of these payments to the company 
must take into account the interest earned by each payment. 
The company must also make the proper deduction for the 
expenses connected with the conduct of its business and for 
a reasonable profit.* 

Only by investigations of the sort here indicated can the 
proper rates and the proper methods of conducting the busi-

ness of life insurance be found. Similar questions arise, of 
course, in accident and fire insurance. 

227. Other applications of the theory of probability. There 
are many other applications of the theory of probability. 
One of the most notable of these is the theory of errors of 
observation.'"' Every measurement made by man is subject 
to inaccuracies due in part to unavoidable defects in the in- 
struments, and in part to physiological causes. Thus, if the 
same quantity is measured independently several times in 
succession, the results obtained will usually differ to some 
extent. The questions, how to obtain the most probable 
value from these discordant results, and how to find the 
probable error of this most probable result, are of great 
importance in physics and astronomy.

DETERMINANTS OF THE Â»iti> ORDER AND SYSTEMS OF

We shall now make use of these expressions to suggest by 
analogy the definition for a determinant of the nWi order. 
In both (1) and (2) we have a square array of numbers. 
The first term in the right member is, in both cases, the 
product of all of the elements which occur in that diagonal 
of the square array which passes from its upper left-hand to 
its lower right-hand corner. All of the other terms in the 
right member are obtained from this first or principal term 
by making a permutation of the subscripts while the letters 
are left in their alphabetic order. Those terms are preceded 
by a 'plus sign whose subscripts are so arranged as to form 
an even permutation, the principal permutation being 1, 2, 8. 
(See Art. 218.) The other terms are preceded by a minus 
sign. 

Thus 13 2 has one inversion (3 before 2). It is therefore an odd 
permutation and the corresponding term a\h;\c-i of (2) is preceded by a 
minus sign. Again 3 1 2 has two inversions (3 before 1, and 3 before 2). 
The corresponding term a-^\C.^ is preceded by a plus sign.

Art. 228] DEFINITION OK A DETKllMIXANT 377 

We now proceed to dt'liiic a dL-tenninant of the nth 
order. 

1. Consider a >(quare arrai/ of n^ numbers^ each of ivhich is 
called an element of (he determinant ; this array may he. writ- 
ten as follows :

and consists of n (horizontal) rows and n {vertical) columns. 
The notation has been chosen in such a way that the eleme)its 
in one and the same column are represented hy the same letter 
{column mark) while the elements of the same row have the 
same i<uhxcript {row mark). 

'1. The diagonal which passes from the upper left-hand to 
the loirer right-hand corner of this square array is called the 
principal diagonal and the jyroduct of the n numbers in this 
diagonal 

(4) ajVg ... ^â€ž 

is called the principal term of the determinant. . 

3. Let us consider all of the possible products which can be 
formed from the array (3) by taking as factors one elemeiit, 
and only one, from every column and every row. One of these 
products will he the principal term (4). Each of these prod- 
ucts may be ivritten in the form 

where every letter {or columti mark) occurs once and only o)ice, 
since one and only one factor is to be taken from each column, 
and where the letters a^e ivritten in their normal order. Among 
the subscripts ?'j, i^, â€¢â€¢â€¢, V &very one of the numbers 1, 2, ..-, w 
ivill occur once and only once, since one and only one factor of 

(5) is to be taken from each row of (3).

DETERMIXANTS OF THE 71^^ ORDER [Art. 229 



term being regarded as the principal permutation. (See Art. 
218.) 

5. There are n! such products. (See Art. 214.) They 
are called the terms of the determinant. The algebraic sum 
of these n ! terms., the sign of each term being determined by the 
rule given in No. 4, is a number called the determinant of the 
r? numbers (3). 

Thus we see that a determinant of the ?ith order is a 
single number which is obtained from n^ given numbers, 
arranged in a square arrajs by performing the various opera- 
tions described in the above definition. 

The symbol for such a determinant is obtained from the 
square array of its elements (8) by inclosing it between two 
vertical lines. Thus, the symbol 



(6) 



Z) =

h. 



calls for the formation of a single number D from the n^ 

given ones by means of the operations just described. 

Another notation, in some respects preferable to the one 

used above, for the elements of a determinant is shown in 

the formula

in which each element has two subscripts, the first subscript 
indicating the row and the second the column in which it 
occurs in the array. 

229. Another method for determining the sign of a term of 
the determinant. In our definition (Art. 228) we thought 
of any term of the determinant as written in the form 

(1) ^i,K<^H â– â– â–  ^in^ 



Art. 229] SIGN OF ANY TERM 379 

where the letters a, b, â€¢â€¢', k were in their alphabetic order. 
The sign to be i)retixe(l to this term was + or â€” according 
as ^'^, i^-, â€¢â€¢â€¢, in ^^'^^ an even or odd permutation of 1, 2, â€¢â€¢â€¢, n. 
We may, however, rearrange the factors of (1) so as to 
make the subscripts appear in the natural order 1, 2, â€¢â€¢â€¢, n. 
If we do this, the letters will now no longer appear in their 
alphabetic order. Let us count tlie number of inversions 
in this permutation of the letters, tliinking of the alphabetic 
order as the principal permutation (^see Art. 218), thus 
enabling us to decide whether this permutation of the let- 
ters is even or odd. 

We shall find that this permutation of the letters is even or 
odd according as the permutation of the subscripts in (1) was 
even or odd. 

That this is true follows from the following remark. In 
the product formed from the factors a^^^ b^,^,"-, ki^, taken in 
any specified order, let us interchange any two of the 
factors. We are then interchanging, in the first place, two 
of the subscripts and therefore we are changing the number 
of inversions of the subscripts by an odd number (The- 
orem 2, Art. 218). At the same time we are interchanging 
two of the letters, so that the number of inversions occur- 
ring among the letters will also be changed by an odd num- 
ber. Let us add the number of inversions of the subscripts 
to the number of inversions in the letters. The change pro- 
duced in this sum, by interchanging two of the factors of 
the product, will be an even number, since the sum of two 
odd numbers is always even. Consequently, the sum of the 
number of inversions of the letters and of the number of inver- 
sions in the subscripts in such a product, will not change its 
character of evenness or oddness by any rearrangement of the 
factors. 

In (1) the letters are written in their natural order, that 
is, with no inversions. Let there be i inversions among the 
subscripts. Rewrite (1) so as to make the subscripts occur 
in their natural order, that is, with no inversions, and let 



380 



DETERMINANTS OF THE w^'' ORDER [Art. 230 



j be the number of resulting inversions among the letters. 
Then, the sums + ^ and j + are either both even or both 
odd, that is, i 'dndj are both even or botli odd. 

Consequently, we may determine the sign of any term of 
the, determinant hy the rule of No. 4 of the definition given in 
Art. '22H. We inay equally well rewrite the term in such a 
way as to cause the subscripts to appear in their natural order, 
and prefix the plus or minus sign according as the resulting 
permutation of the letters is even or odd. Both methods ivdl 
give the same result. , 

230. Properties of determinants. We are now ready to 
show that determinants of the nt\\ order have essentially the 
same properties which we found in Art. 208 for determi- 
nants of the third order. 

1. A determinant of the nth order does not cha^ige its value 
if its elements are transposed, that is, if its roivs he converted 
into columns and its columns into rows, the relative order of 
rows and columns not being changed. 

Proof. Let

We observe in the first place that, when we apply the definition of 
Art. 228 to each of these determinants, exactly the same terms will 
appear in both, since these terms are formed by computing all possible 
products of n elements obtained by taking one and only one element from 
each row, and one and only one element from each column. ]Moreover, 
the corresponding terms of the two determinants will have the same sign 
prefixed to them, on accoimt of the final theorem of Art. 229. Therefore 
the two determinants are equal. 

2. If all of the elements of a row or column of a determi- 
nant are equal to zero, the value of the determinant is zero. 

For every term of the determinant will contain as one of its factors an ele- 
ment of the row or column in question, and will therefore be equal to zero. 



Art. 230] PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS 381 

3. If two roivs or columns of a determinant are interchanged^ 
the relative order of the elements in such rows or columns not 
being altered^ the determinant merely changes its sign. 

Proof. Change of two rows is equivalent to an interchange of two 
of the subscripts (row marks) in every term of the determinant. But 
such an interchange increases or diminishes the number of inversions 
among the subscripts by an odd number (Theorem 2, Art. 218), and 
therefore clianges the sign of tlie corresponding term of the determinant. 
(No. 4, Art. 228.) Similarly for interchange of two columns according 
to tlie final theorem of Art. 229. 

4. If all of the elements of a row (or column) are multiplied 
by the same factor w, the determinant is multiplied by m. 

Proof. Of the elements which are multiplied by m, one and only 
one occurs in every term of the determinant. 

5. A determinant of the nth order is equal to zero if two of 
its parallel lines (rows or columns) read alike, that is, if all 
pairs of corresponding elements in two parallel lines are equal 
to each other. 

The proof is exactly the same as for determinants of the third order. 
(See Theorem 5, Art. 208.) 

6. If every element of any row or column is expressed as a 
sum of two terms, the determinant may be expressed as a sum 
of two others. 

For instance,

To prove this theorem observe that, as a result of the hypothesis, any 
term of the original determinant may be expressed as a sum of two terms, 
each of which is one of the terms occurring in the expansion of another 
determinant. 

7. If to the elements of any row or column we add the corre- 
.^ponding elements of a parallel row or column, multiplied by one 
and the same factor, the value of the determinant is not changed. 



382 DETERMINANTS OF THE n**^ ORDER [Art. 281 

Proof as in the case of third order determinants. (See Theorem 7, 
Art. 208.) 

Before we can generalize the remaining theorems of 
Art. 208, we must discuss the notions of minors and cofactors 
of a determinant of the wth order. 

231. Minors. Consider a determinant of the nth order and 
suppress both the row and the column in which any particular 
element lies. The determinant of the {n â€” 1)^^ order formed 
from, the remaining elements, ivithout disturbing their relative 
position, is called the minor of the element in question. 

For examples of such minors see Art. 206. 

Let us use the notation Dg for tlie minor of any element 
of D which is named e. Thus, the minor of Â«j will be called 
Da^i that of Cg will be i><,^, and so on. We then find the fol- 
lowing theorem. 

1. If the determinant D is expanded, the sum of all of those 
terms which involve the element a^ (^which stands in the upper 
left-hand corner of D) is a^D^^. 

Proof. According to the definition of a determinant of the nth order^ 
Art. 228, every term of D which contains a^ as a factor is formed by 
multiplying a^ by a product of n â€” 1 elements chosen from the n â€” 1 
rows and columns of D which are different from the first row and the 
first column, and chosen in such a way that one and only one element is 
selected from each of these rows and columns. Consequently every term 
of this kind is obtained by multiplying a^ by a term of D^j. Moreover, 
the sign which precedes such a term of D will be the same as that which 
precedes the corresponding terms of D^^, since the number of inversions 
among the subscripts in any term of D^^, such as 

'2 '3 '/l' 

will not be changed if we write Oj in front of it. 

2. If we denote by e the element in the ith roiv and the kth 
column of D, the sum of all of the terms of I), lohich have e as 
a factor, is ^_ -^y+,^j)^^ 

To prove this theorem, we observe that e may be brought into the 
position originally occupied by a^ without disturbing the relative posi- 



Art. 231] MINORS 383 

tion of any of the elements of D excepting those which lie in the row 
and column in w^hich e stands. This may be done by first interchanging 
the row in which e stands with the preceding row and repeating this 
operation until e stands in the first row. Since e was originally in the 
ith row, i â€” \ such operations will accomplish this result. We may then, 
by interchanging columns in the same way, bring e finally into the posi- 
tion originally occupied by Oj. This will be accomplished after k â€” \ 
further operations, making 

i-\ + k-\ = i+k-'2 

operations in all. Each of these operations changes tlie sign of the 
determinant (Theorem 3, Art. 230). Consequently we shall have 

if we denote by D' the new determinant obtained from D by these 
i -\- k â€” 2 operations. The minor, D'^ of e in Z>', is the same as the 
minor, D^ of e in D, since the elements in both determinants are the same, 
and since the rows and columns of the two determinants, excepting only 
the row and the column which contains e, are arranged in the same rela- 
tive order. Hence D^ = D\. 

By Theorem 1 the sura of all of those terms of D' which contain e as 
a factor is eD'^ = eD^' Therefore the sum of the corresponding terms 
in D is 

as we wish to prove. 

If this proof does not seem quite clear to the student, let him actually 
trace the changes of sign which take place as some element, say d^, of 
the determinant of the fourth order 

a^ a^ ag a^ 

&i &2 ^3 ^'4 

c-y Co <'^ c^ 
f/j d.^ d^ d^ 

is gradually brought into the upper left-hand corner. 

As a result of Theorem 2 we obtain at once the following 
theorem. 

3. Let us fix our attention upon any particular row or 
column of a determinant. Multiply every element of such a 
row or column by its minor and prefix the plus or minus sign 



384 DETERMINANTS OF THE n^^ ORDER [Art. 2:52 

to this pi'oduct according as we find a plus or minus sign in the 
place which corresponds to that element in the diagram of signs 

+ - + - â€¢ 
- + - + â€¢ 
+ - + - â€¢ 



which contains n^ signs arranged in a square array ^ alternating 
in checkerboard fashion^ the signs along the principal diagonal 
all being -\- . The algebraic sum of all such products, with the 
proper sign prefixed^ will be equal to the value of the deter- 
7ninant. 

This follows from Theorem 2 because (â€” 1)Â»+* is equal to + 1 or â€” 1 
according to the indications given by the diagram of signs. 

This method of expressing a determinant is called expand- 
ing with respect to the elements of a definite row or column. 
Since the minors are determinants of a lower order, to which 
the same method of expansion may be applied, this method 
is often convenient when we wish to calculate the value of a 
determinant. (Compare Art. 206 for the special case of 
determinants of the third order.) 

232. Cofactors. If e denotes again that element of D which 
stands in the ith row and the kth column, the quantitg 

which differs from the minor Dg at most in sign^ is called the 
cofactor of e. 

Let us denote by Ai, Bi, â€¢â€¢â€¢, A2, Bo, â€¢â€¢â€¢, the cofactors of di, /y,, â– â€¢â€¢, 112, h-i, 
â€¢ â€¢â€¢ respectively, in tlie deterniiiiaiit D. Then we may write 



Z>= r/,.li 4 (uAi + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + aâ€žA, 
D^h.B^ + b.B. + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + ^/Jâ€ž

D =aâ€ž.4â€ž + IkB,^ + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + Aâ€ž/vâ€ž.

To prove, for instance, the first equation of (1) it suffices to remark 
that flj^i represents the aggregate of all of those terms of D which con- 
tain Oj, that a.,.!, is equal to the sum of all of those terms of D which 
contain (z.^, and so on. 

But equations (1) and (2) are equivalent to Theorem 8 of Art. 208, 
which was there proved only for determinants of the third order. 
Theorem 9 of Art. 208 may be generalized to determinants of the rjth 
order by an argument whi(Oi involves merely a repetition of the essential 
features of the proof given in Art. 208 for third order determinants. 
Thus we have the further result: 

Theorems 8 and 9 of Art. 208 are true of determinants of 
any order.

If we multiply both members of the equations (1) in order by

In the case n = 3 these formulas reduce to equations (8) of Art. 209, 
if we put x^ = X, X2 = y, Xg = z. 

From (3) and (4) we obtain the values of the unknowns x,, Xo, â€¢â– â–  , Xn 
if we divide by D, provided of course that D is not equal to zero. 



Art. 234] HOMOGENEOUS EQUATIONS 387 

Just as in the case n = o we obtain tlie following theorem: 

A Si/stem of n linear equations ivith n unknowns has a single 
solution composed of the n numbers i'j, .rg, â– â– â€¢, tâ€ž, obtainable fronn 
(3) and (4) by dividing by />, provided that the determinant 
D of the coefficients of the unknoivns is not equal to zero. 

If D is equal to zero and if even a single one of the deter- 
minants occurring in the right members of (3^ and (4) is dif- 
ferent from zero^ the system (1) lias no solution, that is, the n 
equations (1) are not consistent. 

The following supplementary theorem we shall state with- 
out proof. 

If D = 0, and if besides all of the nth order determinants 
which are written in the right members of (3) and (4) are also 
equal to zero, then system (1) has infinitely many solutions. 
More specifically let us assume that among the minors of D 
there exists at least one determinant of the (nâ€” l)th order which 
is not equal to zero. Then a single one of the n unknowns may 
be left arbitrary and all of the others may be expressed in 
terms of that one. 

234. Homogeneous equations. If rj = 7*2 = â€¢â€¢â€¢ = râ€ž = 0, 
equations (1) of Art. 233 assume the form 

a-^^x^ + ^^3-2 + â–  â€¢ â€¢ + ^,.râ€ž = 0, 
n\ Â«2^i + V2 + â€¢â€¢ â€¢+ h^n= 0, 

Â«na^i + br^x^ + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + k^x^ = 0. 

Such a system is said to be homogeneous. The discussion of 
Art. 210 may be generalized to the case of n unknowns 
without any trouble, giving rise to the following theorem. 

The homogeneous equations (1) have no solution except the 
obvious one x-^^ = x^ = â– â€¢â€¢ = Xn= 0, if their determinant D is 
different from zero. If I> = these equations have infinitely 
many solutions besides the obvious one. If in this case when 
D = 0, among the minors of D, there exists at least one deter- 
minant of the (jn â€” l)th order which is not equal to zero, then the 



388 DETERMINANTS OF THE n^^ ORDER [Arts. 235-237 

ratios of the n unknowns^ x-^: x^: â€¢â– â–  : 2;â€ž, ivill he determined 
unique! 1/ b>/ the given equations. If all of these minors vanish, 
even these ratios luill not be determined uniquely. 

235. Systems of linear equations with more equations than 
unknowns. Obviously such systems will ordinarily not be 
consistent. We might solve n of these equations for the n 
unknowns. The resulting values will ordinarily not satisfy 
the remaining equations which were not used in the solution. 
The conditions for consistency are obtained by demanding 
that the values of the unknowns obtained from w of the 
equations shall also satisfy the remaining equations. These 
conditions can always be expressed most conveniently by 
ec^uating to zero certain systems of determinants. 

236. Systems of linear equations with fewer equations than 
unknowns. Let there be m equations and m -{â–  n unknowns. 
We can ordinarily solve these equations for m of the un- 
knowns in terms of the remaining n whose values remain 
perfectly arbitrary. Such systems therefore usually have 
infinitely many solutions. 

Thus the system 

(1) x + y - z=\, X- y + -2z = 2, 

may be solved for x and ij in terms of ~, giving 

(2) :,^__i(3 + ~), y = 1(3 2-1). 

The values (2) will satisfy (1) no matter what the value of z may be. 

237. Application of determinants to the theory of elimina- 
tion. A quadratic equation 

(1) ax'^ + bx + c = 

has two roots x^ and x^. Similarly a second quadratic 
equation 

(2) a'x"^ + b'x-\- c' = 

also has two roots which may be called x^ and x^. Ordi- 
narily neither of the two roots of (2) will also be a root of 



Art. 237] ELIMINATION 389 

(1), but in special cases it may happen that this is the case. 
What condition must the coefficients of the two quadratics 
satisfy in order that they may have a root in common ? 

We may find this condition as folh)\vs. If tlie equations 
(1) and (2) have a root in common, let it be called x. Then 
X will satisfy the following four equations : 

+ ax^ + l>.r + c = 0, 

.3. + a'x^ + h'x + c' = 0, 

ax^ + bx^ + C.V + (J = 0, 

a'x^-hh'x^ +c's +0 =0. 

But we may regard (3) as a system of four homogeneous 
equations for the determination of the four (quantities 

Not all of these quantities can be zero, since x^ is equal to 
unity, even if x^, x^^ and x^ should happen to be equal to zero. 
Therefore according to the tlieorcm given in Art. 234, the 
determinant 



E = 



must he equal to zero if the equations (1) and (2) have a root 
in common. Our argument does not suffice to prove the 
converse; that is, if E=0, then the two (quadratics actually 
have a root in common. Su(!h, however, is actually the case, 
a statement which we shall leave without proof. U is called 
the eliminant or resultant of the two quadratics (1) and (2).

CHAPTER Xril 

QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TV70 INDEPENDENT VARI- 
ABLES AND SIMULTANEOUS QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 

238. Integral rational functions of two independent vari- 
ables. A function of the two independent variables x and y is 
said to he an integral rational function, if it can be expressed as 
a sum of a finite number of terms of the form 

(1) Ax'>/\ 

where A is a constant coefficient (that is, a quantity not de- 
pending for its value on x or y^ and ivhere the exponents, r 
and s, are positive integers. 

Tlie sum of the exponents, r and s, is called the degree, 
order, or dimension of tlie terra (1). An integral rational 
function is said to be of degree, order, or dimension w if there 
occurs in it at least one term of order n and no term of degree 
greater than n. 

According to this rnle xr-, xy, and y"^ are terras of the sec- 
ond order in x and y. Some students find it difficult to 
understand why the terra xy should be classified as being 
of the second order. To clear up- this difficulty, consider x 
and y as the numerical measures of line-segments (ex- 
pressed in inches) ; then each of the three terms x"^, xy, and 
y"^ may be regarded as the numerical measure of an area 
(expressed in square inches). 

EXERCISE evil 
State the degree of each of the following functions of x and y :

392 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 239 

Express the following as functions of two independent variables: 

13. The volume and surface of a rectangular parallelopiped of dimen- 
sions X, X, y. 

14. The volume and total surface of a right circular cylinder of 
radius r, and altitude /(. 

15. The volume and total surface of a right circular cone of altitude 
11, if the radius of its circular base is r. 

239. Quadratic function of x and y. A?! integral rational 
function of the seco7id order is called a quadratic function. 

Thus, a quadratic function can contain only terms involv- 
ing a:^, xy., y^^ x, ?/, and a term independent of x and y. The 
most general quadratic function of x and y may be written 
as follows 

(1) fi^x, y) =Ax^ + 2 Hxy + By'' ^ -1 Gx + 2 Fy + O, 

where the constant coefficients A, B, (7, F, (x, H may have 
any values whatever. We have used the notations 2 F., 
2 6r, and 1 H to represent the coefficients of ^, a;, and a;y, in 
this expression, rather than F, G-, and H., because the for- 
mulas assume a somewhat simpler aspect when we use this 
notation. (Compare the corresponding remark in Art. 71.) 

EXERCISE CVIII 

In each of the following examples, determine the values of A, B, C, 
F, G, and H. 

1. f(x, .'/) = B 3-2 + 4 xi/ + 7 //2 - 4 X + 8 ?/ - 10. 

2. /â– (.!â– . //) = 7 x^ - ") .r// + 4 If- + -ix -2y + G. 

3. f(x, y) = - x- - 2 x + \. 

4. /(.r, y) = X- + ?/2 â€” 4. 

240. Composite and non-composite quadratic functions. 

Clearly, the product of two linear functions of x and y is 
a quadratic function. Therefore, some quadratic functions 
can be expressed as products of two linear functions. 
Whenever this is the case we shall say that the quadratic 
function is composite or factorable. We shall now show how

the question may be decided whether a given quadratic 
function, 

(1) fix, y) = Ax-^ +-2EXI/ + Bf + 2 Gx + -2 Ft/ + C, 

is composite or not. 

Let us le-write (1), arrano'ing the terms according to 
descending powers of ?/. \Vc fnul 

(2) f(x, y ) = ^//2 +2(^Hx + F)y + Aj^ + 2 Gx + O.

We may, for a moment, think only of the way in which

pends upon X also, hi order to do this it will help us to

394 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 240 

Since the factors of /(a;, ^) as exliibited in (6) contain the 
square root of jo^ â€” 4 q, these factors, although rational and 
of the first degree in y, will in general be irrational func- 
tions of X. As shown by (6) and (7), the only irrationality 
which these factors contain is the square root of the integral 
quadratic function 

(8) Q {x) = (ir2 - AB)x'' + %FH- B a)x + F'^ - BO, 

and the square root of Q{x} will be a rational function of x 
if and only if the two linear factors of Q (a;) are the same 
(see Art. 152), or, as we may express it briefly, if Q{x^ is a 
perfect square. 

We may rewrite Q{x} as follows: 

(9) Q(^x) = ax^-\-bx-{-c, 
if we put 

(10) a = H^-AB,b= 2(Fff- BG), e=F^- BO. 

The two linear factors of Q{x^ will be the same if and 
only if 

(11) b^-4:ac=0. (See Arts. 68 to 70.) 

If we introduce the values (10) of a, 5, c into this condition 
(11), we find , 

4(iFIf - Bay - 4(H^ - AB)(F^ - BC} = 0, 

or, dividing both members by 4 and performing the indicated 
operations, 

F^IT^-2BFaH+ B'^G^ 

- (i^2^2 _ ^^^2 _ ^CH^ + AB^C) = 0, 
which reduces to 

(12) - 2 BFQH^ B^G-'^ + ABF'^ + BCm - AB^O^ 0. 

Every term of this expression contains B as a factor. 
Since we are just now treating the case B ^0, (12) can be 
satisfied only if 



Art. 1240] DISCRIMINANT OF A QUADRATIC FUNCTION 395 

-2FaH+BG^ + AF^+ CH^-ABC=0, 

or, rearranging the terms and changing all of the signs, if 

(13) ABC+IFGR-AF^-BG^- (77/2 = 0. 

Thus, in order that the given quadratic function may be a 
product of two linear functions, its coefficients, A, B, C, F, 
G, Â£[, must satisfy the condition (13), at least if B is different 
from zero. Moreover, if B^O, and if A, J5, C, F, G, H do 
satisfy this condition (13), the given quadratic function can 
actually be expressed as a product of two linear functions. 
The factors are given by (6) where, if (13) is satisfied, the 
square root which occurs will reduce to a linear function 
of X. 

The quantity which occurs in the left member of (13) is 
usually denoted by A (pronounced delta) and is called the 
discriminant of the quadratic function (1) of x and y. 

Our argument only covers the case B ^ 0. If i? = we have, instead 
of (1), the simpler expression 

f(x, y) = Ax^ + 2 Hxy + 2 Gx + 2 Fy + C. 

Let us assume that A is not also equal to zero and let us arrange /(r, y) 
according to descending powers of x. We may now repeat our argu- 
ment essentially as above merely interchanging the part played by the 
two variables x and y. The resulting condition for factorability will turn 
out to be 

(14) 2FGn- AF^ - CH^^O. 

But this is precisely w-hat (13) would reduce to in the case 5 = 0. We 
conclude that the condition (lo) may be used even it B = 0, although 
our original method of finding this condition was not applicable to this 
case. 

Our argument now covers all cases in which at least one of the num- 
bers A and B is not equal to zero. It remains to consider the case 
^ = 5 = 0. The function (1) reduces to 

(15) f(x, y)=2 II xy + 2 Gx + 2 Fy + C, 

where we may assume /f ^ 0, since otherwise the function would reduce 
to a linear function. 

If (15) is a product of two linear functions only one of the factors 
can contain x. For otherwise the product would contain a term involv- 
ing X-. Similarly, only one of the factors can contain y. Therefore, if 



896 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Aur. 240 

(15) is a product of linear factors at ail, it must be equal to a product of 
the form 

(16) {px -\- q){r7j -{- s). 

Tims, in this case, (15) must l)e equal to (16), that is, we must have 
â€¢ 2 Ilxy + 2 Gx + 2 Fi/ + C = prxy + psx + qry + qs 

for all values of x and y. But this is possible only if 

(17) 2II^pr, 2G^ps, 2 F = qr, C = qs. 

Since, in the case under consideration, we also have A = B = 0, the left 
member of (1:5) will assume the value 

'qr\( P><\f pf\ p-r'^ _1 â€ž ., 1 



'(f^jlf )(?â– ) ~ 9^^ = |PV'Â« - ^P'V 



0. 



Consequently condition (13) is satisfied by the coefficients of a composite 
quadratic function even ii A = P> â€” 0. Conversely, if the coefficients of a 
quadratic function satisfy the conditions (13) and A = B = 0, we have 

(18) ^ = jB = 0, 2 FGH - CH^ = 0, H =^0, 

and we can actually find four numbers p, q, r, and s which satisfy equa- 
tions (17). It suffices for this purpose to put 

p = 2II, q = 2F, r^l, s = ^ = -^ 
f ' / H 2F 

where the two values obtained for s are equal on account of (18), and 
where F is assumed to be different from zero. If F should be equal to 
zero, we should, according to (18), find C = also, since H ^ 0, and (15) 
would reduce to 

f(x, y) = 2 Ilxy + 2 Gx = 2 x (Hy + G^ 

the composite nature of which is evident by insjiection. 

We liave proved the following important theorem: 
An integral rational quadratic function 

( 1 9) Ax"^ + 2 Hxy + Bf + 2 G.v + 2 Ft/ + 

may he expressed as a product of two integral rational functions 
of the first degree., if and only if the coefficients satisfy the con- 
dition that the discriminant 

(20) A ^ ABC +2 Faff- AF'^ -BG"^- Gff'^ 

is equal to zero. 

It is easy to apply this criterion to any given quadratic 
function. It is also easy to actually find the factors if the 



Art. 240] COMPOSITE QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS 397 

condition is satisfied. It is sufficient for tliis purpose to 
apply the general methods of this article. 

If tlie function (10) is homogeneous, that is, if it contains 
no terms of degree lower than the second, we have (7=0, 
F= 0, (r = 0, and therefore, according to (20), A will also 
be equal to zero. Therefore, every homof/eneous quadratic 
function may be resolved into integral rational factors of (he 
first degree. 

The factors of (19) need not be real. Thus the factors of the homo- 
geneous function x- + y'^ are .r + /// and :r â€” i;/. 

EXERCISE CIX 

1. Is 2 x^ â€” xy â€” 3 _?/â– - +9 X- + 4^ + 7 a composite function ? If so, 
find its factors. 

Solution. We have .4=2, 73 = - 3, C = 7, F = 2, G = f, H = - j, 
and, therefore, find A = 0. Therefore the function is composite. To find 
the factors follow the general method of Art. 240. The given function 
is equal to 

^ .r/^ l-'--^)-' (â€¢f-4)-^ + 12(2x'^ + 9x + 7) -| 

__ .^ r/ 2- + y - 4 \^ 25 x^ + 100 X + lOO l

= -J,(Gx+()^ + G)(-4x + Gy-14)=-(.t-f//+l)(-2x + 3^-7) 

= (x + i/ + l)(2x-3y + 7). 

Thus, 2 a;2 - x/y - 3 y- + 9 X + 4 y + 7 = (x + y + 1) (2 X - 3 3/ + 7). 

The result may be checked by multiplying out the product in the 
right member. 

In each of the following examples state whether the given function 
is composite or not. Find the factors if they exist.

898 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 241 

241. The values of a quadratic function. In order to 
obtain some idea of tlie values wliich a quadratic function 
takes on for various values of x and ?/, we formulate tlie 
question : what are all of the values of x and y which cause 
the function to assume the given value h ? That is, what 
are the values of x and y for which 

(1) ^z2 + 2 Hxy + By'^+2ax^2Fy+0=V'^ 

These values are obviously the same as those which cause 
the new quadratic function 

(2) Ax'^ + IHxy + By'^^-^ax+IFy+O-h 

to assume the particular value zero. Since (2) is a function 
of the same kind as the left member of (1), our question 
may be regarded as answered if we can only solve the fol- 
lowing, somewhat simpler, problem. To find all of those 
pairs of values for x and y which will satisfy any given equa- 
tion of the form 

(3) Ax"^ + IHxy + By^ -^ 2 ax + ^Fy + C = 0. 

Every pair of numbers which, when substituted for x and 
y, will satisfy equation (3) is called a solution of the equa- 
tion. The equation is called a quadratic equation. 



EXERCISE CX 

In each of the following examples test the given pair of numbers, to 
see whether or not they constitute a solution of the given equation. 
Give the details of your work. 

1. X- â€” 4 z^ = ; X = 2, ?/ = 1. 

2. x2 + 2 x?/ + ?/2 = 5 ; X = 1, 2/ = 1.

6. (X - ?/)2 + 2x - 3/ = 2; X = 0, 2/ = 2. 



Art. 242] EXISTENCE OF SOLUTIONS 399 

242. The existence of solutions of a quadratic equation. 
Every quadratic equation 

(1) A.i- + 2 Hxy + %2 + ^ax+ IFij + 6'= 

Aas infinitely many solutions. For we may substitute for x 
any number we please (real or complex), and then obtain, 
if B =^ 0, two corresponding values for y by solving the 
equation (1), which then becomes a quadratic equation with 
a single unknown, for y. Thus (1) may be tliought of as 
defining y as a two-valued function of x, provided that B is 
not equal to zero. If B = and if at least one of the coef- 
ticients ^and F is not equal to zero, we find that (1) defines 
3/ as a one-valued function of x. Finally if B, F, and II hre 
all equal to zero, the equation (1) does not contain any y ; 
it will be satisfied by the two values of x which are roots of 
the equation Ax^ -\- 2 G-x-\- C= 0; with each of these values 
of X may be associated arbitrary values of y. 

Although, as we have just seen, every equation of the 
form (1) has infinitely many solutions, it does not follow 
that these solutions are real. There actually exist equations 
of this sort which have no real solutions at all. 

Thus the equation x- + //- + 4 = has no real solutions. For, if x 
and y are real numbers, x^ and y'^ cannot be negative, and therefore 
a;2 + ^- + 4 cannot assume any value less than 4 for real A'alues of x and 
y. The equation x^ + ^^ _ o ^as one and only one real solution, namely 
X = ^ = 0. 

We have shown in Art. 240 how the left member of (1) 
may be resolved into two factors of the first degree in y if 
B ^ 0. In order that the equation (1) ma}^ be satisfied, one 
of these factors at least must vanish. Therefore, if we use 
the notations of Art. 240, we find the following explicit 
expression for ?/ as a function of x : 



(2) ^^ -pÂ±y-4y ^

400 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO A^ARIABLES [Art. 242 

These formulas show clearly the two- valued character of 
this function, since we may use either the plus or minus sign 
in (2). We may also, and in many respects this is desirable, 
regard (2) as defining two one-valued functions rather than 
a single two-valued function. The resulting tivo functions 
are rational or irrational according as p^ â€” 4q is a perfect 
square or not, that is, according as the discriminarit A o/" (1) 
is or is not equal to zero. 

The case B =Q is easily settled. We shall leave the dis- 
cussion of this case as an exercise for the student. 

The formulas (2) and (3) give us the general solution of 
equation (1) in the case B ^ 0. If we substitute in them 
for X any number whatever, and then compute the corre- 
sponding values of ?/, all pairs of numbers, x and i/, obtained 
in this way are solutions of (1). 

EXERCISE CXI 

Solve each of the following equations for ?/ as a function of x and dis- 
cuss the following questions. Is the resulting function one-valued or 
two-valued ? If it is two-valued in general, are there any particular

of X will the resulting values of y also be real?

Akt. 21:3] GRAPH OF QUADRATIC EQUATION 401 

243. Graph of a function defined by a quadratic equation in 
X and y. Whenever a function, detinecl by means of a quad- 
ratic equation in x and y, is real, that is, if tlie quadratic 
equation has real solutions, these may be plotted as points 
in accordance witli the metliod which we have used so fre- 
quently. The general question as to the nature of the 
graphs obtained in tins way, while not very dilTicult, is 
usually reserved for the course in analytic geometry. 
There are, however, several special cases in which it is quite 
easy to draw the graphs. We shall now discuss some of 
these cases, a few of which have appeared already in this 
book in a different connection. 

Case 1. The graph of a quadratic equation in x and y con- 
sists of a pair of straight lines if the discriminant A is equal to 

zero. 

For we have seen in Art. 240 that, in this case, the quad- 
ratic function is a product of two linear functions, say 
a^T + b^g + c^ and a^x+b^g + c^ ; and we have also shown how 
these linear factors may be found. The values of x and y, 
which cause the quadratic function to vanish, must make 
at least one of the factors equal to zero. But the locus of 
all of those points, whose coordinates cause a linear function 
of X and g to vanish, is a straight line. Therefore, the 
graph of a quadratic equation with a vanishing discriminant 
consists of the two straight lines 

a^x + b^g -(- (?! = 0, a^r -f- b.^r/ + c.^ = 0, 

whose equations are obtained by equating to zero the linear 
factors of the quadratic function. 

Case 2. If B = 0, g becomes a rational function of x. 
If A = 0, X becomes a rational function of g. \\\ either case, 
the graph may be constructed by the methods of Art. 140, 
special attention being devoted to the poles of these rational 
functions whenever they have any poles. (See Art. 139.) 

For illustrations see Art. 140. 



402 QUADRATIC FUNCTIOXS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 243 

Case 3. If F = G- = H = 0, the locus of the equation is 
symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis. In this 
case the origin is called the center of the locus. 

Proof. The equation, in this case, reduces to 
(1) Ax'^ + %2 ^ c=0. 

If this equation is satisfied by a pair of numbers (a;, j/), it 
will also be satisfied by the pair (a;, â€” y'), since only the 
second power of y occurs in the equation and since 
(~~ I/)^ = (+ ^)^- ^^t ^li6 ^^^o points (2;, ^) and (.t;, â€” y} 
are symmetrically situated with respect to the a:-axis. A 
similar argument shows that for any point (x, y^ which is 
on the graph of (1), there exists a second point (â€” a;,["?/) 
which is also on the graph and which is symmetric to the 
first point with respect to the y-axis. 

It is easy to see what the graph of (1) will look like in 
the various cases. If B = 0, (1) does not contain any y 
term at all, and solution of the equation for x shows that the 
graph consists of a pair of lines parallel to the y-axis. These 
lines may be real and distinct, coincident, or imaginary. 
Of course in this case A is equal to zero. 

li B =^ 0, we may rewrite (1) as follows 



y^ = 


Ax^-\- A ^ 
B = B^- 

Â«/2 = mx'^ + w, 



' B' 



or 

(2) 

if we use the abbreviations, m and n, for â€” A/B and â€” C/B 
respectively. The appearance of the graph depends essen- 
tially on the values of m and w, and more especially upon 
the signs of these numbers. 

Case 3 a. If m = 0, the graph of (2) reduces to a pair 
of straight lines, parallel to the a;-axis, namely the lines for 
which 

y â€” Â± Vw. 



Art. 243] GRAPH OF QUADRATIC EQUATION 403 

These lines are real and distinct, coincident, or imaginary, 
according as n is positive, zero, or negative. 

Case ?> h. \i )i = 0, the graph of (2) reduces to a pair of 
straight lines throngli the origin, namely y = Â± Vma\ these 
lines being real and distinct only if ni is positive. 

Case 3 c. If m and n are both negative, the right mem- 
ber of (2) will be negative for all real values of x. Conse- 
quently, in this case, no real values of i/ will correspond to 
real values of x; the equation has no real solutions and it has 
no real graph. 

There remain three cases, namely Case 3 d when w < 0, 
% > 0, Case 3 e when m > 0, w < 0, and Case 3/ when m > 0, 
n>0. 

Case Z d. w < 0, w > 0. We may write, in this case, 

(3) m = â€” k\ n = k^a^, 

where a and k may be regarded as positive numbers whose 
values may be computed from (3) in any case where m and 
n are given, m as a negative and w as a positive number. 
Then (2) becomes 

y = â€” k^x"^ + k'^aP- = k'^(^a^ â€” a;^), 
whence 



(4) y = Â± kVa^ â€” x\ 

If x^ > a^ a^ â€” x^ will be negative and therefore y will 
be imaginary, as shown by (4). Therefore, there are no 
points on the graph whose distances from 
the ?/-axis are greater than a. Let us 
mark the points A and A' on the a;-axis 
(see Fig. 70) whose abscissas are equal 
to + a and â€” a respectively. If we draw 
lines parallel to the y-axis through these 
points, we know then that no point of 
the graph can be outside of the strip inclosed by these two 
lines. The points A and A' themselves are points of the 
graph. For if we put a; = Â± a in (4), we find y = 0. 




404 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 243 



For X = 0, equation (4) gives y = Â± ka. Let us construct 
the points B and B' on the y-axis (Fig. 70) whose ordi- 
nates are equal to + ka and â€” ka respectively. Both of 
these points are on the graph of equation (4). For any 
value of X which lies between â€” a and + a, we find from 
(4) two values of y, of the same absolute value but of oppo- 
site sigh, thus proving again that the graph is sjanmetric 
with respect to the a^-axis. Moreover as x increases from 
to a, the numerical value of y decreases from ka to 0. 

If ^ < 1, the case assumed in constructing Fig. 70, OB is 
less than OA. If ^ > 1, we should find OB > OA. If ^ = 1, 
we have OB = OA^ and it looks as though the curve would 
be a circle with as its center. This is actually the case. 
For if ^ = 1, (4) becomes

But, if X and y are the coordinates of a point 
P (see Fig. 71), x^ -\- y'^ will be the square of 
the distance from the origin to the point 
P. If the point P moves in such a way that 

x^^f- = OP 



always remains equal to the same number a^^ it must remain 
on the circumference of a circle whose center is and 
whose radius is equal to a. Therefore, the graph of (5) is 
indeed a circle whose center is at the origin and whose radius 
is equal to a. 

When k is not equal to unity, the graph of (4) is called 
ill! ellipse. The line-segments AA' and BB' are called the 
principal axes of the ellipse, the larger one being the major 
axis and the smaller the minor axis. 

Case 3 e. m > 0, w < 0. In this case we put 
m = k^, n = â€” k'^a^,

The discussion of this case is ^y 

quite similar to that of Case 3 d. 
But this time the values of x 
which give rise to imaginary 
values of y are the small values, 
namely those for which a? < a^. 
The vertical strip of width 2 a, 
between A and A\ instead of in- 
cluding all of the points of the 
curve as it does in Case 3 d, does not include any point of 
the curve. The curve has two infinite diverging branches, 
as illustrated in Fig. 72, and is called a hyperbola. Case 3/ 
also leads to a hyperbola, but located in a different way. It 
may be obtained by rotating Fig. 72 through an angle of 90Â°. 

Case 4. If H= 0, if A and B are both different from zero, 
while at least one of the numbers F and (7 is not equal to zero, 
the (jraph will have the same general characteristics as in Case 
3, but the tivo axes of symmetry will not both coincide with the 
coordinate axes. They will merely he parallel to the coordinate 
axes. 

The following illustrative example will show how the 
axes of symmetry may be obtained, by the process of com- 
pleting the squares, and how the locus of such an equation 
may be plottc^l. 

Example. Discuss 4 a;^ + sy^ _ g x â€” 4 y + -4 â€” 0.

and proceed similarly for the terms involving //. This gives

Let us mark the point O' whose co- 
ordinates are x = 1, y = 2 (see Fig. 
73) and ciroose a new coordinate sys- 
tem with O' as origin, the new (x' 
and y') axes being parallel to the 
old (x and y) axes. Let P be a point 
whose coordinates referred to the old 
coordinate system are x and y, and 
let its new coordinates be called x' and 
y'. Then we have (see Fig. 73) 

X = OM, y= MP, 
x' = O'M', y' = jWP, 
OB' = 1, B'O' = 2,

Let us substitute these values in (8). AVe find

which is an equation of the form discussed under Case 3. Thus the x' 
axis and y' axis are the axes of symmetry of this curve, and the point 0' 
is its center. We may continue the discussion as in Case 3 and verify 
that the loans is the ellipse ABA'B' shown in Fig. 73. 

Case 5. If F = G- = Q^ that is, if the equation contains no 
terms of the first degree, the origin is the center of the locus. 

Such an equation lias the form 
(10) Ax"^ + 2 m-g + Bg^ +(7=0. 

If X and g constitute a pair of numbers which satisfy this 
equation, the numbers (â€”.?-, â€” ^) will also form such a pair. 
But the origin is always halfway between two points whose 
coordinates are (x, g^ and ( â€” a;, â€” ?/) . Consequently the 
locus of any equation of the form (10) has the property 
that, to every point P which is on the locus, there corre- 
sponds another point P' also on the locus, sucli that the 
segment PP' is bisected at the origin. This is what we 
mean by saying that the origin is the center of the curve. 



Art. 244] LINEAR AND QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 407 

Case 6. This is the general case which we shall not dis- 
cuss in detail. It may be stated, however, without proof, 
that the graph will always be an ellipse, a parabola, a hyper- 
bola, or a pair of straight lines. The distinction between 
this case and the others which we have discussed lies merely 
in the fact that the axes of symmetry of the curve will not 
be related to the .r-axis and y-axis in such a simple manner. 

All of the curves, which may be obtained as loci of quad- 
ratic equations in x and y, are known by the collective name 
conies.

244. Solution of a system of simultaneous equations one of 
which is linear and one of which is quadratic. All of the 
points whose coordinates satisfy an equation of the first

nates satisfy an equation of the second degree 

(2) Ax^ + 2 my +Bif + 2 a.r + '2Fij+C=0 

are on the conic (parabola, ellipse, hyperbola, or a pair of 
straight lines) which is the locus of (2). The points whose 
coordinates satisfy both equations, if there are any, will be 
the common points, or points of intersection, of the straight 
line and the conic. Therefore we may find the real solutions 
which the two equations (1) and (2) have in common, hy draw- 
ing the line and the conic represented hy these two equations 
individually, and then measuring the coordinates of their points 
of intersection. 

The common solutions of the two equations may also be 
found quite easily by algebra. We solve (1) for y, and sub- 
stitute the resulting value of y in (2), thus obtaining a quad- 
ratic equation for x alone. If Xj^ and x^ are the two roots of this 



408 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 244 

quadratic equation, there will correspond, by means of (1), 
to each of these values of a; a value of y. If y^ and y^ are 
these values of ?/, the common solutions of (1) and (2) will 
be (Xy, y-[) and (x^, y,^. This process would fail only if m 
were equal to zero. In that case we solve (1) for x^ and 
substitute the resulting value in (2), obtaining a quadratic 
for y alone. 

We always obtain two solutions (a^j, y-^ and (x^-, y^) which 
may, however, as in the simple case of Art. 70, be real and 
distinct, coincident,' or imaginary. The corresponding loci 
actually intersect in distinct points only when the solutions 
are real and distinct. If the two solutions coincide, the 
straight line is tangent to the conic. If the solutions are 
imaginary, the straight line and the conic do not intersect at 
all.

245. Simultaneous quadratics. The problem of finding 
those pairs of numbers, x and //, which satisfy eacli of two 
quadratic equations 

(1) Ax^^1Hxij^Bif^2ax-\-1Fy-^C=^, 

(2) Ax^ + 2 E'xy + B' if +'2a'x + 2 F y + C' = 

is equivalent graphically to that of finding the coordinates 
of those points in which the two conies intersect which are 
obtained by making the graphs of (1) and (2). Conse- 
quently we have a graphic solution of the problem immedi- 
ately available. We need merely draw the graphs of the 
two equations, determine their points of intersections, and 
measure the coordinates of these points. However, this 
graphical method will only furnish the real solutions of the 
problem, and these only approximately. 

We might think of attacking the algebraic sohition of the problem 
by means of the following direct but rather clumsy method. Arrange 

(1) according to descending powers of ij, and solve the resulting equa- 
tion, which is a quadratic in y, for y as a function of x. The resulting 
expression for y is given by ("i) and (3) of Art. 242. If we substitute 
this value of y in equation (2), we obtain in general an irrational 
equation for x. If this be rationalized (see Art. 154), the resulting 
equation for x turns out to be, in general, an equation of the fourth de- 
gree. Since such an equation has four roots (Art. 126), the solution of 
this equation will furnish four values of x. 

In similar fashion, elimination of x between the equatinns (1) and 

(2) gives rise to an equation of the fourth degree for y, the oolution of 
which furnishes four values of y. 

The four values of x and the four values of //, obtained in this way, 
can be combined into jiairs in sixteen ways. But not all of these pairs 
are solutions of (1) and (2). It remains, therefore, to ascertain, by 
actual substitution in (1) and (2), which of these sixteen combinations 
are actually solutions of the simultaneous system (1) and (2). 

This rather laborious process may he simplified very consid- 
erably by making use of the results of the following article. 

246. Equivalent systems of simultaneous equations. Let 

us denote by /(a;, ^) and f\x^ y) the two quadratic 
functions 



410 QUADKATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 246 

(1) f(x, y) = Ax'^+2 Hxij + By"^ + 2ax+ 2 Fy + C, 

(2) f'(x, y) = A'x-2 + 2 H'xy + B'y^ +2a'x + 2 F'y + C", 
and let us put 

(3) g(x,y) = a.f(x,y:, + b.f(x,y\ 

(4) g' (X, y) = a' â–  /(.r, y} + h' -fix, y), 

where a, J, a', and 6' are four constants whose values may 
be chosen arbitrarily. Then g(x^ y/) and g' (x, y') will also 
be quadratic functions of x and y, although in some special 
cases ^(a:, ?/) or ^'(.r, ^) may reduce to a linear function, 
^(.r, y~) and ^(.r, ^) are said to be linear combinations of 
fix, y) and/'(.r, ^). 

If we multiply both members of (3) by h\ those of (4) 
by â€” 6, add, and then interchange members, we find 

{ah' - a'b}f{x, y) = b' â–  g{x, y) - b â–  g' (x, y}. 

Simihirly, let us multiply both members of (3) by â€” a', 
those of (4) by + a, and add. We find 

(ab' - a'b^f'(x, y) = - a' â–  g{x, y') + a - g'Qx, y). 

If ab' â€” a'b is different from zero, we may write the last 
two equations as follows ; 

(5) fix, ?/) = -^^ ^/, r/-^^' 

ab ~ a'b 

^^\ /C-^'^)- ab'-a'b 

In other words, if 

a b 
(7) 



.' A' 



= ab' â€” a'b^O, 



not only will g(x, y^ and g' (x, ?/) be linear combinations of 
f(x, ?/) and f'(x, y}-, but conversely f(x, y') and f'(x, y^ will 
also be linear combinations of g(x, ?/) and g' {x, ?/). 

Now let (x, y) be any solution of the simultaneous quad- 
ratic equations 

(8) /(^, J/) = 0, f'ix,y-) = 0. 



Art. 247] NORMALIZATION 411 

According to (3) and (4), (a;, y/) will also be a solution of 
the simultaneous quadratics 

(9) gix,n-) = % g'{x,y)==Q. 

Conversely, according to (5) and (6), any solution of (9) 
will also be a solution of (8). Consequently the two sys- 
tems (8) and (9) have exactly the same solutions, that is, 
every solution of one system is also a solution of the other. 
In other words, the two systems are equivalent. We have 
proved the following important theorem : 

All of the solutions of a system of two simultaneous 
quadratics 

(10) /(.r,2/) = 0, /'(.r,i/) = 
are also solutions of the system 

(11) a .f(x, y)+h ./(.T, y)=0, a' .f(x, y}+b' .f'(x, y) = 0, 

whose left members are said to he linear combinations with con- 
stant coefficients a, b, a', ?/, of the left members of (10). More- 
over, the tivo systems (10) and (11) are equivalent, if the 
constant coefficients a, b, a\ b' are such as to make 



(12)

247. Normalization. We shall now make use of this 
theorem to simplify the solution of a system of simultaneous 
quadratic equations 

(1) f(x, y) = Ax^ +2Hxy + By'^ + 2ax+2Fy + C=0, 

(2) f'{x, y-) = A'x^ + 2H'xy + B' y'^+2a'x+2 F'y + C =Q. 

Let us make the following linear combinations of f(x, y') 
aud/(.c, ^): 

(3) gir, y^ = B' .fix, y)-B -fix, y), 
g'Qc, y) = -A' -fQx, y^) + A -fix, y). 



412 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 247 

In the notation of Art. 246, this amonnts to putting 

a=B',h = -B,a' = -A',h' = + A, 

so that we have, in our case, 

ah' -a'h = AB' -A'B. 

According to the final theorem of Art. 246, the equations 
g(x, 3/) = and g' (x^ ^) = will therefore form a system 
equivalent to (1) and (2) if 

(4) AB'-A'B^O. 

But we find, from (1), (2), and (3), that these equations 
become 

(5) c/{x, g) = (AB'-A'B).i^-\-2(HB'-H'B)xi/+^ + - = 0, 
and 

(6) g'{x,y)=^-{-2(AII'-A'Hyxi/+(AB'-A'B}f-h"- = 0, 

where we have merely indicated the terms of lower degree 
than the second by dots, and where the asterisk >|< indicates 
that the corresponding term has not been omitted by mis- 
take, but that the coefficient of that term is actually equal 
to zero. 

We may rewrite equations (5) and (6) as follows : 

"^ ^ ^ + 2H^xy + B^y'^+2a^x+2F^ij+ C^ = 0, 

if we put 

A^ = AB' - A'B, H^ = HB' - H'B, etc. 

Thus, we may replace system (1), (2), by a system equiva- 
lent to it of the simpler form (7) provided that AB' â€” A'B 
is not equal to zero. 

Let us consider now the case, hitherto excluded, that 

(8) AB' - A'B = 0. 

Then equation (6) contains at most one second degree term, 
namely 

(9) 2(iAH' - A'H^xy = 2 H^xy, 



Art. 247] NORiMALIZATION 413 

siuce the coefficient of a-^ is equal to zero, on account of (8). 
It may happen tliat the term (9) is also absent, namely if 
H^ = AH' â€” A'R= 0. In that case the equation g'(x, Â«/) = 
becomes linear,* and our system of equations may be solved 
by the method of Art. 244. If, however, H^ =^ 0, we may 
replace the two equations (1) and (2) by tlie equivalent 
system 

^2^+2 Hxy + By^+'iax + 2Fy+ O' = 
* + 2 K^y + * +2 (^..r + 2 F^_y + C^ = 0, 

and, by means of the second equation, we can eliminate the 
xy term from the first, giving rise to a new equivalent sys- 
tem of the form 

^.. A.x'' + * + By- + 2 a,x + 2F^y+ C\ = 0, 
'^ ^ * + 2 ff^xy + * + 2 (7,.r + 2 F,y + (7. = 0. 

Thus, by the process of linear combinations, we may always 
reduce a system of two independent simultayieous quadratics tvith 
two unknowns either to the form (7), or to the form (10), or 
else to a system in which one of the equations is of the first 
degree only. 

When a system of simultaneous quadratics has been re- 
duced to one of these forms, we shall say that the S3'stem 
has been normalized. 

One great advantage of this normalization consists in the 
greater facility which it gives us in making a graphic 
solution. The loci of both of the equations of the normal- 
ized system (7) are easily plotted because one of these 
equations gives y as a rational function of x, while the other 
gives X as n, rational function of y. These graphs fall under 
the case 2 of Art. 243. If the normalized system is of form 
(10), the second equation will again give y as a rational 

* It might even happen that all of the coefticiciirs of this equation are equal 
to zero. In that case we say that theoriijinal two equations are not independent; 
one of them is a mere multiple of the other, the graphs of the two equations 
coincide, and every solution of one equation satisfies them hoth. We are assum- 
ing tacitly that the two given equations are independent, so that this case may 
be I'egarded as excluded. 



414 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 248 

function of x. The graph of the first equation will also be 
obtained easily, although it does not determine ^ as a 
rational function of x, because this graph comes under 
Case 4 of Art. 243. 

The student should not make the mistake of thinking that 
the graphs of the two original equations are the same as 
those of the two equations obtained from them by normaliza- 
tion. They are, in general, quite different, and it is pre- 
cisely this difference which accounts for the fact that the 
graphs are easier to construct for the normalized system 
than for the original. However, the points of intersection of 
the two pairs of graphs are the same, and that is the only 
thing we care about just now. 

EXERCISE CXIV 

Normalize the following systems of quadratics :

248. Existence of four solutions. Let us assume that 
AB' â€” A'B is different from zero, and let us normalize our 
system. We may then consider the normalized system (7) 
of Art. 247 instead of the original two equations. PVom 
the second of these equations we find, solving for a:, 

so that a; is a ratiotial function of y. If we substitute this 
value of X in the first of the equations (7), Art. 247, we find 
the following fractional equation for y : 

, f ^^2 + 2 F, ^ + C,r- jj- B,f^ + ^. F4, + (7,

- 4 a,iff,y + G^)(B^jf + -2F,y+ C^) 
+ KH^y+ a^)\^F,y+C\) = 0. 

If we perform the indicated multiplications, a rather long 
but perfectly elementary operation, we observe that (2) is 
an equation of the fourth degree in y, unless the coefficient 
of y^ should happen to be equal to zero. Thus there will 
exist, in general, four numbers t/j, j/g' ^3' ^4' which satisfy 
equation (2). (See Art. 126.) If we substitute in order 
these four values of y in (1), we find four corresponding 
values of a:, which may be called x^^ a-g, Xg, x^. We thus find 
four solutions, namely, (a-j, y{), (x^, y^), (x^, yg), and (a:^, y^) 
of the normalized system, and therefore also of the original 
system. 

If AB' â€” A'B is equal to zero, the normalized system has 
the form (10), Art. 247, instead of (7), Art. 247, but the 
argument remains essentially the same. We have, therefore, 
the following result. 

A system of two simultaneous quadratics with two unknowns 
in general has four solutions. 

Of course, since these solutions may be obtained by first 
solving an equation of the fourth degree with a single un- 
known, and since the roots of such an equation may be real 
or complex, finite or infinite, distinct or coincident (see 
Arts. 126 and 134), we are not asserting that the four solu- 
tions of the system are all real, finite, and distinct. We 
may say, however, that two simultaneous quadratics with tu'o 
unknowns have at most four distinct real, finite solutions if the 
two equations are independent. (See footnote on page 413 
for the definition of independence.) 

The graph of each of the two equations is a conic, and 
these two conies do not coincide if the equations are inde- 
pendent. We have therefore given an algebraic proof of 
the following theorem: 



416 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 249 

Two distinct conies have four points of intersection. Since, 
however, some of these points of intersection may have 
imaginary or infinite coordinates, and since several of them 
may coincide, we may state this theorem somewhat more 
concretely by saying that two distinct conies never have more 
than four real and distinct points of intersection. 

249. Special cases of two simultaneous quadratics. As we 

have just seen, the solution of two simultaneous quadratics 
may always be reduced to tlie problem of finding the roots 
of a certain equation of the fourth order with a single un- 
known. But in some cases this equation of the fourth order 
reduces to a quadratic, and in some other cases it may be 
solved by the methods which are used in solving quadratics. 
The following four articles are devoted to the discussion of 
some such cases. 

250. Case I. H=H' = F=F' = G = G' = 0. Neither equa- 
tion contains a first degree term nor a term in xy. The equa- 
tions are of the form 

(1) Ax'^ + Bf+C=0, 

A'aP' + B'y-^ + C'=0. 

These equations may be regarded as linear equations with 
ofi and y^ as unknowns. Solve them for x^ and y"^^ and then 
obtain x and y by extracting square roots. 

This method of sohition is quite in accord with the spirit of our 
s^eneral method. To solve (1) for x^ and //- is essentially the same thing 
as to normalize system (1) by the first method of Art. 247. The equa- 
lion ot the fourth degree (2) of Art. 248 in this particular case reduces 
lo a pure quadratic.

giving the four solutions,

The graj)!! of the first ecjuation of (1) is the ellipse ABA'B', that of 
the second equation (1) is tlie circle CDEF oi Fig. 74. These intersect 
in the four points Q, R, S, T whose 
coordinates are given by the four 
solutions (4). 

But observe how much easier 
it is to draw the graphs of the 
equations (2). The graph of the 
first equation (2) consists of the 
two lines IIK and H' K', that of 
the second equation (2) consists of 
LM and L'M'. These two pairs of 
lines intersect in the same four 
points Q, R, S, T as the ellipse and 
the circle, as they should according to the general theory, since systems 
(1) and (2) are equivalent. 

Solve the following systems algebraically and graphically. In Ex- 
amples 6-9 discuss also the conditions under which the solutions obtained 
will be real and distinct, coincident, or imaginary.

251. Case II. F=F'=G=G' = 0. This case includes 
the preceding one and is more general. Neither equation con- 
tains any first degree terms, but either or both equations may 
contain an xy term. The equations are of the form ; 



418 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 251 

,. . f A.r^ 4- 2 Ht?/ + Bf+C=0, 

^ ^ \a'x'^+ 2 R't>/ + B'f + C = 0. 

By linear combination we can obtain from these, the equation 

C QAx^ + 2 Rri/ + %2 + C-) - C(A 'x^ +2 R'xy-\-B'f+ C') = 

or 

(2) (iAC -A' C)x^- + 2(HC' - IT' C)xy + {BC'~B' 0)^=0, 

which is homogeneous in x and y and whose graph therefore 
consists of a pair of straight lines through the origin. (See 
Art. 240.) The system composed of (2) and either one of 
the original equations is equivalent to (1). But (2) may 
be decomposed into two separate equations of the form 

(3) ax + hy=0, {â– \~) a' x + h' y = 0, 

if ax + hy and a' x + h'y are the factors of the left member of 
(2). Hence by solving each of the first degree equations 

(3) and (4) simultaneously with one of the equations (1) 
Ave obtain the four solutions of (1). 

Illustrative Example. Solve the following system of equations: 

(4) a;- + 3 xy - 28 = 0. 

(5) x2 + f- 20 = 0. 

Solution. To form the homogeneous equation (2) in this case, we 
multiply both members of (4) by â€” .5, those of (5) by 7 and add. This 
gives 

2x-- loa-// + 7//2 = 0, 
or, factoring, 

(6) (2x-y){x-ly)=0. 

The system composed of (5) and (6) is equivalent to the original system 
(4), (5). But according to (6) we have either 

(7) y = 2 X, or (8) y = ^ X. 
Substituting the value (7) in (5) gives 

^2 + 4 x2 = 20, 5 .r2 = 20, .r2 = 4, x=Â± 2, 

and therefore from (7), y =Â±i. Thus (+2, +4) and (-2, - 4) are 
two solutions. Substituting the value (8) in (.5) gives the other two 
solutions (+|\/10, + ^VlO) and (-^VIO, -|VlO). 



Art. 251] 



NO FIRST DEGREE TERM

A second solution. The following modified form of the solution is 
convenient. Since we know that by finding the factors of the homo- 
geneous function which occurs on the left member of (2), and equating 
one of these factors to zero, we shall obtain an equation of the first 
degree of the form y = 7nx (see (7) and (8)), we substitute // = mx in the 
given equations, and regard m as an unknown quantity. Thus (4) and 
(.5) become 

a;2 + 3 nix^ = 28, x- + m-x- = 20, 

Solving each of these equations for x- gives

m = 2 or +. 



â– whose roots are 



Since we had piit // = ?nx, we now know that either 

?/ = 2 .r or ?/ = f X. 

These are the same equations as (7) and (8) and now we proceed as in 
the first solution.

ical solution. The graph of

points of intersection ^1, B, C, 
D are the solutions of our sys- 
tem. The graph of (G) is 
composed of the two straight 
lines AC and BD which pass 
through the origin 0. We 
might find the solutions graph- 
ically by drawing the circle 
(the graph of (5)), and these 
two straight lines, and then measuring the coordinates of the four points 
of intersection. Our algebraic process is exactly equivalent to this.

EXERCISE CXVI 
Solve the following systems algebraically, using the simplest graphs 
which you can find to accomplish the purpose. This means, for instance, 
to use the circle and the two straight lines of Fig: 75, rather than the 
cii'cle and the hyperbola.

252. Case III. Both equations contain x and y in sym- 
metric fashion, so that each equation is left unaltered if x and 
y are interchanged. The equations are of the form 

(1) A(x^ + f)+2Hxi/-h2a(x+2/}+ (7=0, 

(2) A' (x^ + j/2) + 2 H'x^ + 2 a' ix + y) + C" = 0. 

In this case it is advisable to introduce the fundamental 
symmetric functions of x and y (see Art. 133) as new un- 
knowns. We put therefore 

(3) x + y = u, xy = v. 

Since 

a;2 j^y'i-^(x^yy'â€”2 xy, 
we shall have 

(4) a;2 + ^2 ^ w2 _ 2 y, 

so that the equations (1) and (2) assume the form 

(5) aw^ + 5m H- 6'v + c? = 0, 

(6) a!iC"^Vu^ c^v + S! = ^. 

From these two equations we can always eliminate ti? by 
linear combination, so as to obtain an equation of the first 
degree between u and o. If this first degree equation be 
solved simultaneously with either (5) or (6) (see Art. 244), 



Art. 252] BOTH EQUATIONS SYMMETRIC 421 

we obtain two sets of values (Wj, Vj) and {u^, v^) ^^^' ^ ^^^^^ ^â€¢ 
It now remains only to solve the systems 

and 

in each of which one of the equations is of the first degree. 

ExAMPLK. Solve the system 

X- + y^ = 25, xy = 12, 
by this method. 

Solution. Putting x + /y = u, xy = v, we have 

u-2 - 2 (' = 25, V = 12. 
Therefore 

u- = 25 + 2 y = 49, w = Â± 7. 

It remains to solve the two systems 

â€¢^â–  + .^ = ^' and l^+U = -7, 



xy = 12, [ xy = 12. 

The solutions of the first system are (3, 4) and (4, 3). Those of the 
second system are (â€”3, â€” 4) and (â€” 4, â€” 3), 

A second method applicable to this case is to substitute 

(7) X = m + n, y = m â€” n, 
so that 

(8) X + ^ = 2 ?n, xy = m? â€” n-, x- + y'-^ = 2(7n- + n-). 

In the above example this would give us 

2(m2 + n^) = 25, m- - n^ = 12, 
whence 

4 m2 = 49, 4 n2 = 1 

TO = Â± I, n =Â± |. 
and tlierefore 

X = I + ^ = 4, or I - 1 = 3, or - I + 1 = - 3, or - I - ^ = - 4, 

to be combined respectively with 

y=i-i = -i, or I-(-D = 4, or - | _ i = - 4, or _|-(-'i) = -3, 

giving the same four solutions as before. 

Geometrically, the symmetry of the equations (1) and (2) 
has the follow! no- signiticance. If x = a, y = h is a point on 
the graph of (1), then the point x=h, // = a is also on the 



422 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 252 



graph of (1). But (see Art. 149) this means that the locus 
of (1) is symmetrical with respect to the line y = x, which 
bisects the angle between the positive a:-axis and y-axis. 
If this is true of both equations, then the solutions of the 
system must correspond to each other in pairs in such a way 
that the two members of a pair belong to points which are 
symmetric with resj^ect to this angle bisector. Observe that 
this is actually so in case of the system which we have just 
solved. 

For the graphic solution of this case it is advisable to 
replace (1) and (2) by an equivalent system composed of 
two equations one of which, at least, shall contain no xy. 
For the graph of such an equation will be a circle whose 

center lies on the bisector of 
the angle between the coordi- 
nate axes. Sometimes (if 
]I= W = 0) both graphs are 
of this kind. In all other 
cases the second equation 
may be chosen so as to con- 
tain no x^ + y^ term. Its 
graph will be a hyperbola 
with a vertical asymptote (see 
Art. 140) unless it happens 
to degenerate into a pair of 
lines, one parallel to the rr-axis and one parallel to the y-axis. 
Figure 76 represents these graphs for the system 

x^ -\- y^ â€” 25, xy = 12 

whose algebraic solution we have just given.

Arts. 253, 2o4] ONE EQUATION COMPOSITE 423 

253. Case IV. When at least one of the given equations is 
composite, that is, when its left member can be factored into 
two integral rational functions of the first degree. Such 
cases ma}' be discovered by computing the discriminant A 
for the left member of each of the given equations. (See 
Art. 240.) If one of these discriminants is equal to zero, 
we can find the linear factors of the left member of the cor- 
responding equation by the method of Art. 240. If we find 
that ax + bi/ + c is one of these factors, we solve the system 
composed of the equation ax -\- bi/ -\- e = and of the other 
quadratic equation. This gives two solutions (see Art. 244). 
We then use the second factor in tlie same way to obtain the 
remaining solutions. 

Example. Solve the following system : 

2 x^ â€” xy â€” 3 //- + 9 X + 4 ^ + 7 = 0, xy = 1. 

Solution. In Ex. 1, Exercise CIX, we have shown that 

2x^-~ xy -'dy-^ + 9x + iy + 7 =(x + y + 1)(2 x - Sy + 7). 

Therefore we may solve separately the two systems 

X + y + I =0, xy = 1, 
and 

2x-Sy + 7-0, xy = 1. 

The details of the solution are left to the student. 

EXERCISE CXVIII 
Solve each of the following systems by using an appropriate method. 

1. (x - 4 y - 3)(r + t/) = 0, 3. x^ + y^ = 28, 
x2 ^y-i - 4- xy = 22. X + y = i. 

2. x2 + y- = a\ Hint. Observe that x + y is a. 
Vx + Vy = Va, factor of x^ + y^. 

where Vx, Vy, \ a are to be re- 4. x* â€” y^ â€” 19, 

garded as positive roots. x ~ y = 1 . 

254. A new method for the general case of simultaneous 
quadratics. The method used in Case IV, Art. 253, may be 
extended as follows. Even if the left member of neither of 
the two given equations 



424 QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES [Art. 254 

( 1) /^(a;, y)=Ax^ + ^IRxy + %2 + 2 ax + 2^^/ + (7= 0, 

(2) f^(x, y^ = Mx'' + "IR^xy + B y'^ + 2a'x + 'lFy+ C = 

can be decomposed into a product of two linear factors, it is 
always possible to find a linear combination of the functions 
fi(x^ y^ and/2(2;, y) which can be factored. 

To prove this, we form the general linear combination 
^/lO^; y^+M^^ y\ of (1) and (2). 

This gives the new equation 

(3) (Ak + A')2^ + liHh + H')xy + {Bk + B'yf 

+ 2((7yt + a')x + 2(Fk + F')y + Ck+C' = 0. 

The left member of (3) will be a product of linear factors, 
if and only if its discriminant (see Art. 240) is equal to 
zero, that is, if and only if 

(4) (Ak-{-A'}(Bk + B'}(Ck + C') 

+ 2(Fk + F')(ak + G')(Hk + H'} - (Ak + A')(Fk + F')^ 

-(Bk + B')(ak+ a'y-iCk+ o'^{Hk+ H>y = Q. 

Now (4) is a cubic equation for k. If the k which occurs in 
(3) is one of the roots of this cubic equation, the left member 
of (3) will be a product of two linear factors, and the system 
composed of (1) and (3), which is equivalent to the original 
system, may be solved by the method of Art. 253. 

This method is applicable in all cases, but requires the 
solution of the cubic equation (4) for k. Thus we see that 
the general problem of solving any system of simtdtaneous 
quadratics may he reduced to that of solving a certain auxiliary 
cubic equation with one unknown. Tliis method is somewhat 
simpler than that of Art. 248, where we required the solu- 
tion of an equation of the fourth degree. However, the 
two methods are closely related. For, as we saw in Art. 124, 
the solution of an equation of the fourth degree requires as 
a preliminary the solution of an auxiliary cubic equation. 

The method outlined in this article becomes immediately 
available in particular, whenever one of the roots of the 
cubic equation (4) happens to be evident by inspection. 



Akt. 2r)o] THE METHOD OF SMALL CORRECTIONS 425 



Cases II and IV (Arts. 251 and 253) are really illustrations 
of this general method. 

EXERCISE CXIX 
1. Set up the cubic equation for k in llie case where the two given 
equations are of the form 

Ax^ + 2 Hxi/ + Bf + r* = 0, A'y- + 2 //'./â– // + />"//- + <"' = 0, 
and show how the method of tliis article applies to Case II. 

255. The method of small corrections. It often happens 
that the graphic solution gives only approximate values of x 
and y and that none of the algebraic methods which we have 
discussed will be convenient for actual numerical work. In 
such cases it is usually desirable to employ the method illus- 
trated in the following example. * 

Find a solution of the simultaneous (juadratics 

(1) 4x-' + !)y^=l 

(2) {x-\y+{ii-\Y = i 

correct to six decimal places. 

The graph of (1) is the elliiise ABA'B' (Fig. 77) which has the 
X-axis and ?/-axis as axes of symmetry and for which OA â€” \, and OB = \. 
The graph of (2) is a circle 
of radius unity, whose center 
C has the coordinates x = 1, 
y = \. Figure 77 shows that 
one point of intersection 5 is 
given approximately by x = 0, 
y = \, and the other point of 
intersection T has coordinates 
which are approximately x = \, 
y = â€” \. We propose to find 
more exact values for the co- 
ordinates of T. 

We regard the values 
X = 0.33, */=â€” 0.2.5 as a first 
approximation. Let 

(3) X = 0..33 + h, y=- 0.25 + k

be the true values of these coordinates. Then h and k, the corrections, 
may be regarded as small quantities whose squares and products may be 
neglected. If we substitute the values (3) in (1) and (2), neglecting 
h', hk, and ^-^, we find the equations of the first degree 

,,. 2.64 A - 4.5 A: = 0.0019, 

W 1.34 A + 1.50 yL- = 0.0114 

for the corrections. Let us solve these equations of the first degree for 
Ti and k, neglecting all figures beyond the 5th decimal place. We find 

(5) /Â« = + 0.00541, k = + 0.00275. 
Substituting these values in (3)- gives the values 

(6) X = 0.33541, y^- 0.24725 

which we regard as a second approximation to the desired coordinates 
of T. 

We now use these new values of x and ij and put 

X = 0.33541 + h^, y^- 0.24725 + k^, 

where /;, and k^ are the further corrections. We obtain the following 
equations for Aj and Atj, 

2.68 \ - 4.45 k^ = 0.000192, 
1.33^1 + 1.49 yti = 0.000062, 
giving 

hi = - 0.000001, ^â– l = + 0.000042. 

The corrected values of x and y will be (to six decimal places) 

X = 0.335409, 1/ = - 0.247208. 

As a check we substitute these values in our original equations. We 

find 

4x^ + 9 >f - 1 = 0.00000283, 

(x - 1)2 + (/y â€” *)â€¢â– =- 1 = 0.00000097. 

A third approximation would not alter our results by as much as a 
single unit of the sixth decimal place. Therefore the values obtained 
are correct to six decimal places. 

This method, known as the method of small corrections, is 
applicable not only to simultaneous quadratics with two un- 
knowns but to equations of higher degree involving more 
than two unknowns. Newton's method (see Art. 97) is 
really a special case of the method of small corrections.

256. Applications which involve simultaneous quadratics. 

The following exercise contains concrete pi'oblenis which 
lead to simultaneous quadratics. They have all been formu- 
lated in terms of general numbers. If the student wishes 
to obtain specific numerical applications, he may of course 
substitute particular numbers for the quantities a, 6, c, etc., 
which are to be regarded as known in each of these examples. 
But the practice of setting up the equations and solving them 
by general formulas is more important, at this stage, than 
that of obtaining numerical results, since the student has had 
ample practice in obtaining such results in the earlier parts of 
this chapter.

areas of the small circles may be equal to 
any specified fractional part m/n of the 

large circle? Wiiat is the smallest value which the sum of the areas of 
the two small circles can ever have ? 




CHAPTER XTV 

SEQUENCES AND SERIES WITH A FINITE NUMBER 
OF TERMS 

257. Continuous and discontinuous variation. All of the 

questions which have occupied our attention so far were in- 
timately connected with the notion of a function^ and we 
discussed, in order, tlie principal properties of linear and 
quadratic functions, rational functions both integral and 
fractional, algeln'aic irrational functions, exponentials and 
logarithms. Finally, in the last two chapters we studied 
linear and quadratic functions of two independent variables. 

In some cases the function f(x)^ which was under con- 
sideration, was defined as a real function for all real values 
of X. In other cases the function was defined only for a 
certain range of values. For instance, the functions log^a; 
and -\/x were defined, as real functions of x, only for posi- 
tive values of x^ and the function Vl â€” a^ is defined as a 
real function only for values of x between â€” 1 and + 1. 
But in all cases we admitted that x might assume any one 
of the values of the range for which the function was defined. 
We always thought of x as changing its value gradually^ 
from its initial to its final value, without omitting any of 
the intermediate values. In other words ive have so far^ 
almost exdusively^ thought of x as varying continuously. 

We now propose to think of x as varying discontinuously. 
More specifically, we shall allow x to assume only integral 
values. Moreover, we shall usually confine ourselves to 
positive integral values of x. 

Although we are only now beginning to enter upon a systematic study 
of functions of x when x is confined to integral values, we have considered 
a few especially important cases of this kind earlier in our course. (Com- 
pare Art. .'36 on arithmetical progression, also Art. 163, Theorem X.)

258. Definition of a sequence. Let us consider the values 
which a function /'(â€¢'â– ) iissumes when x assumes in succession 
tlie vahies 1, 2, 3, 4, â– â€¢â– , n. These values will he ecjual to 

/(I), ./â€¢(â€¢2), ./â€¢(;{), ..., /â€¢(//). 

respectively. Let us call these values Wp w.^, u^ â€¢â– â€¢, ?/.â€ž, so 
that 

(1) Wi =/(-!), W2=/(2), ..., 7^.=/(/0- 

We naturally think of the numbers ?/p u^^ â€¢â€¢â€¢ uâ€ž obtained in 
this way as being arranged in order ; Wj first, u^ second, Wg 
third, â€¢â€¢â€¢, iin in the ?ith place, and we shall say that they form 
a sequence, in accordance with the following definition : 

The 91 umbers of a set are said to form a sequence if the in- 
divii/ual numhers are regarded as standing in a definite rela- 
tion of order with respect to each other^ so that we may in a 
perfectly definite manner speak of the first, the second, â€¢â€¢â€¢, the 
nth number of the set. 

The kth number of the set (1), or the kth term of the 
sequence (1), is 

(2) %=.f(^). 

Since k may assume any one of the values 1, 2, 3, â€¢â€¢â€¢, n, the 
expression (2) may be regarded as representing any one of 
the terms of the sequence. For this reason we also speak 
of u,, as the general term of the sequence (1). 

In the sequence 1, 2, o, â€¢â€¢â€¢ n, we have 

w, = 1, Â»o = 2, W3 = 8, â€¢â– â– ,Uk = k, â€¢â€¢â€¢, wâ€ž = 71. 
In this case/(x-) = x. In the sequence 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, â€¢â€¢â– , 1/2", we have 

Mi = l, Mâ€ž = â€” , Mâ€ž = â€” , â€¢â– â€¢, Â«i= â€” Â» â€¢â€¢â€¢Â» "Â»= ?r ' '^'^d /( j) = â€” â€¢ 
2 2^ 2* 2* 2" .' V ' 2x 

We cannot always write down an explicit formula of the 
form (2) for the ^th terra of a sequence, even when it is 
clear that the sequence is perfectly well defined.

Thus, let ^^ ^ j^^ ^^^ ^ J ^j^ ^^ ^ j_^^4^ g^^^ 

and for any value of k let Hk be the largest decimal fraction with k digits 
to the right of the decimal point whose square is less than 2. In other 
words, let ui, mo, us, â€¢â€¢â– , U). be that sequence of decimal fractions which 
appears when we seek the approximate value of ^2 to 1, 2, 3, â€¢â€¢â€¢ k deci- 
mal places. Although u^ is perfectly well defined by this statement, we 
cannot write down a general explicit formula for m^- 

We shall, nevertheless, be able to say in all cases, that the 
kth term of a sequence is a function of k, and ivrite 

Uk=f(k). 

This equation merely means that the ^th term of the se- 
quence depends upon k for its value, whether we can find an 
explicit formula for it or not. We shall confine most of our 
discussion, however, to the cases where such an explicit 
formula is given, and we miglit begin with the simplest 
case when the function f (x^ is an integral rational function 
of the first order. However, this case has been treated 
already and leads to the theory of arithmetic progressions. 
(See Art. 56.) 

259. Higher progressions. Let us study the case of those 
sequences which naturally come next, that is, the sequences 
which are obtained from a quadratic function 

ax^ -f hx + c 

when we substitute for x in order the values 1, 2, 3, â€¢â€¢â€¢ n. 
The kth. term of such a progression will be 

(1) % = aP + hk + c, 

and w^_^ = a(k - 1)2 + h(k -!)+(? 

will be the (k â€” l)th term. If we denote by A'^_j the dif- 
ference between these two terms, we find 

A'^._j = %. - Uk-^ = aB + hk+c- la{B-'2 /c + 1) -f- h(k- 1) -f e] 
= ak'^-\-hk + câ€”[^ak'^+{hâ€” 2 d)k -\- a -/> + e], 



Art. 259] HIGHER PROGRESSIONS 431 

whence 

(2) A',_i = u, - n,_, = 2ak-a + h. 

Since the right member of (2) is of the Â£rst degree in k, 

the differences ^ , , , , , 

A A A ... A' 

form an arithmetical progression (See end of Art. 258), and 
the differences of these differences (called second differences^ 
are all equal to each other. In fact, if we denote these 
second differences by A";i_j, so that 

AVi=A',-AVi, 
we find, from (2), 

(3) A",_i = -2a{k + 1^ - a +h ~ \^ak - a + h^=2 a, 

and the third differences are all equal to zero. 

There is no difficulty in generalizing this interesting 
result. If the kth term of a sequence is expressible as an 
integral rational function of k, and if this function is of the nth 
degree^ so that 

u^ = ak"" + hk"-'^ + r-A;"-2_|_ ... 4. /^ _|_ ,^^ 

the terms of the sequence which is formed by the nth differences 
tvill all be equal to each other. In other ivords, the nth differ- 
ences are constant^ that is, their value does not depend upon k. 
TJie (n + V)th and all differences of a higher order will be equal 
to zero. 

This theorem has a very important application. When 
the numerical values of a function f(x) have been tabulated 
for certain equidistant values of x, as in the case of a table 
of logarithms, the values of /(.f) which correspond to inter- 
mediate values of x must be obtained by interpolation. (See 
Art. 171.) In the ordinary logarithmic tables the values of 
a;, for wliicli the function is tabulated, are so close to each 
other that the ordinary method of interpolation, in which 
only first differences are used, is satisfactory. In fact the 
second differences are either zero, or else their values do not 
exceed a single unit of the last decimal place which is used 



432 SEQUENCES AND SERIES [Art. 260 

in the calculation. But in many cases it is impracticable to 
make the tables so extensive. The Nautical Almanac, for 
instance, gives the declination of the sun, that is, the dis- 
tance in degrees of its center from the celestial equator, for 
noon of every day of the year. If we wish to find the 
declination of the sun at 6 A.M., we must interpolate and, in 
this case, the first differences are not approximately constant, 
so that the ordinary method of inter[)olation does not suffice. 
The method of interpolation by higher differences rests upon 
the fact that the converse of tlie above theorem can be 
established. That is, if the nth differences of a function are 
constant, the function may he regarded as an integral rational 
function of the nth order. For a proof of this theorem, and 
for further details in the theory of interpolation, we must 
refer to other sources. 

260. Geometric progressions. Another important sequence 
is obtained by considering the values which an exponential 
function ar"" assumes for a: = 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¢â€¢â€¢ w. These values, 
namely, a, ar, ar"^, ar^^ â€¢â€¢â€¢, Â«r", form a geometric progression, 
and we have already had tlie opportunity of becoming ac- 
quainted with the principal properties of such progressions. 
(See Arts. 59-63.)

Akts. 261, 262] SUMMATION OF SERIES 433 

261. Series. Whenever we have a sequence Mj, u^, W3, â€¢â€¢â€¢ mâ€ž, 
the sum of all of the terms of this sequence, 

Sâ€ž=Ui+ u^+ â– â– â–  + uâ€ž, 

is called a series. Since we may think of ;t, the number of 
terms, as being large or small, and since the sum of n terms 
of a sequence will depend upon the value of /i, we may say 
that jSn is a function of n, and this fact is indicated in the 
notation. 

Tn the case of arithmetic and geometric progressions 
we have been able to find simple formulas for S^ (see 
Art. 56 and Art. 60), which make it possible to compute the 
value of *S'â€ž without actually adding up all of the individual 
terms. Whenever such a formula has been found, which 
gives explicitly the value of >S'â€ž as a function of ?i, we say 
that the series u^ + U2+ â€” h Â«â€ž has been summed: the prob- 
lem of finding such a formula is known as the problem of 
summation of series. 

262. Summation of series by mathematical induction. In 
very many cases we can obtain a formula for the sum of a 
series by the method of mathematical induction. In fact the 
summation of series by this method is one of the best means 
for becoming thoroughly familiar with the method of mathe- 
matical induction, which is one of the most important forms 
of mathematical reasoning, and Avhich we have used several 
times in this book (See Arts. 84 and 88.) The following 
example will illustrate the method. 

Illustrativk Exampi,k. We observe that 

(1) 1+3 = 4 = 22, 1 + 3 + .â– ) = = 3'^ 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 42. 

These equations suggest that the following law may be true ; the sum of 
the n first odd integers is equal to ur. In fact, equations (1) prove that 
tlie law is true in the three special cases when n â€” 2. 3, or 4. 

To prove that the law actually is true for all values of n. we first 
prove the following leinina, or auxiliary theorem. 

Lkmm A. If the sum of the first k odd integers is equal to k-, then the 
sum of the first k + I odd integers will be equal to (k + l)^. 



434 SEQUENCES AND SERIES [Art. 203 

Proof of the lemma. The kt\\ odd integer is 2 A â€” 1, since the odd 
integers form an arithmetic progression whose first term is 1 and wliose 
constant difference is 2. Therefore, //'the sum of the first k odd integers 
is equal to k'^, we have 

(2) 1 + 3 + 5+ ... +(2A--l)=A---2. 

The sum of the first k + 1 odd integers will be obtained by adding the 
{k + l)th odd integer (which is 2 k -\- 1) to the sum of the first k odd 
integers. If the latter is given by (2), we shall therefore have 

(3) 1 + .3 + .0+ ... +(2/.-l)+(2/.+ 1) = B + 2k + l = {k+ \y. 

In other words : if (2) is true, then (8) must also be true, thus proving 
the lemma. 

But we know from (1) tliat the sum of the fii-st four odd integers is 
42. Apply the lemma for the case k â€” 4. The lemma tells us that the 
sum of the first five odd integers is 5-. Apply the lemma to the case 
k = 5. It tells us that the sum of the first six odd integers is 6^. Pro- 
ceeding in this way we finally conclude that the sum of the first n odd 
integers actually is equal to n^. 

263. General characteristics of the method of mathematical 
induction. The theorems which are capable of proof by 
mathematical induction have the following characteristics : 

(a) The theorem asserts that a certain property or relation 
is valid in all of a certain well-defined set of cases. 

(6) The cases with which the theorem is concerned can be 
arranged in a definite order, so that there is a first, a second, 
â€¢ â€¢â€¢, a kih. case. 

(c) The total number of cases may be large or small. But 
the most useful applications of the method of mathematical 
induction to theorems of this sort are those in which the 
number of cases is large. 

The proof of a theorem of this kind by mathematical 
induction always consists of two parts. 

The first part of the proof consists in verifying that the 
theorem states the truth in the first few cases. We shall 
call this part of the proof, the verification. 

For the purposes of the proof by mathematical induction, it really 
suffices to verify the correctness of the theorem for the very first case. 
But frequently, as in the illustrative example of Art. 262, the statement 



Art. 263] MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION 435 

whose general validity is to be proved is suggested in the first place by 
inspection of what actually happens in the first /ew cases. It is for this 
reason that the word induction is used in this connection. 

The second part of the proof consists in proving the lemma : 
if the theorem is true in the kth case, it will also be true in the 
(^k + l^fh case. 

This usually constitutes the more difficult part of the proof. If we 
have made the verification and proved the lemma, tiie proof of the 
theorem is complete. For the lemma enables us to conclude, from the 
fact that the theorem is true in case one, that it is true in case two. 
From this the lemma enables us to assert the truth of the theorem in 
case three, and so on for all cases. The lemma may or may not be true, 
but until we prove it to be true we have not proved the general theorem. 

In a proof by mathematical induction both parts of the proof 
are equally important. 

The following example, which is of considerable interest historically, 
will illustrate the fact that the first part of the proof alone does not 
suffice to jjrove the theorem. The numbers 

2 + 1 = 3, 2-^ + 1 = 5, 24+ 1 = 17, 28 + 1 = 257, 2i6 + 1 = 65537 

are all prime numbers (See Art. 3) and they are all expressible in the 
form .,.^fc ^ J 

Thus the numbers of the form 2-* + 1 are certainly prime numbers for 
k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. An incomplete induction would therefore make it seem 
likely that all numbers of this form are prime numbers. In fact, Fermat 
(1601-1665) thought that this was the case. But Euler showed later 
(in 1732) that this was not so by proving that the number given by 
2-^ + 1 = 232 + 1 = 4,294,967,297 is divisible by 641. 

Another illustration of this sort, due to Euler, is given by the expression 
n'iâ€”n + 41. If we compute the values of this function for n = 0, 1, 2, 
3, ..., 40, we find that all of the resulting values are prime numbers. The 
evidence seems to be very strong in favor of the assertion that ifl â€” n + ^\ 
is always a prime number. But it is very easy to see that this is not so. 
For n = 41 we find n2 _ â€ž + 41 = 412, and this is obviously not a prime 
number. Two similar expressions due to Legendre (1752-1833) are 
,j-2 + n + 17, which represents prime numbers for all integral values of n 
less than 17, and 2/t- + 28, which represents prime numbers for all values 
of n less than 28. 

All of the examples given so far emphasize the importance of the 



436 SEQUENCES AND SERIES [Art. 263 

second part of the proof by mathematical induction. We shall now give 
an example to illustrate the fact that the second part, when not accom- 
panied by the first part, does not constitute a complete proof. The veri- 
fication, or first part, is also essential. 

If we were to omit the verification we might easily prove the follow- 
ing proposition, which is an obvious contradiction to the illustrative 
example of Art. 262 : the sum of the first n odd integers is equal to 
2.5 + n2. 

In fact, the proof of the lemma is easy. If 

(1) 1-^3+5+ ... +(2k- 1)= 2.5 + k% 
then 

(2) 1 + 3 + 5+ ...-f(2^:-l) + (2A: + l)=25 + A:H2^ + l=25+(A,- + l)2. 
From this it would follow that 

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + C2 n - 1) = 25 + n^ 

in all cases, if this equation were true for 7i â€” 1, which, however, is not 
the case. 

The process of mathematical induction may be compared 
to the process of climbing up a ladder. The first part of 
the proof (preliminary verification for the first case) assures 
us that we can put our foot on the ladder ; the ladder actu- 
ally touches the ground and the first round is within reach. 
The second part of the proof assures us that there is no 
round missing ; we can actually pass from the ^th to the 
(k + l)th round.

where I is any positive integer, and where every term of the

merator of the right member is a product of / + 1 factors. 
Formula (4) is certainly true for Z = 1, 2, 3, for in these 
cases it reduces to equations (1), (2), (3) respectively. 

To prove the validity of (4) in general, we proceed as follovps. The 
^th terra of the series vrhich occurs in (4) is 

(5) n, = ^-(^^ + l)(^- + 2)-(^+/-l). 

It is a product of I factors, and may be expi'essed simply in terms of two 
similar expressions, each of which contains I + 1 factors. In fact, if we 
put 

(6) Vk = k(k +l)(Ic + 2)...(k + l- IXk + 0, 
and therefore 

(7) r,_, =(k - l)k(k + 1) ... (k + l- 2) (A- + 1-1), 

we observe that the first / factors of r/, are the same as the last / factors 
of J'i-i, so that 

Vk - i'A-i = K'' + 1)(^- + 2)...(k + l-l)lk + l- (k - 1)],

or, 

(8) V, - v,.t = k(k + l)(^â€¢ + 2) ... (k + l- !)(/ + 1). 

But the product of the first / factors of the right member of (8) is equal 
to Â«fc, so that we find 

(9) v^-r,_i=(!+l)H,. 

Let us write down the particular equations which follow from (9) if

The sum of all of the left members reduces to râ€ž â€” I'l, since each of the 
other terms i'2. is â€¢â– â€¢ i'â€ž_i occurs twice, once with a plus and once with a 
minus sign. Therefore we find, by addition, 

(11) I'u - '-i =(/ + l)('/2 + "3 + Â»4 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + "â€ž)â€¢

so that

which is merely another way of writing the equation (4) which was to 
to be proved. 

Formula (4) is important, because it enables us to find the 
sum of n terms of any series whose kth term is an integral 
rational function of k, the degree of this function and its 
coefficients being the same for all values of k. 

For, let the A^th term of a series be given by an expression of the form

and we observe that *S'â€ž approaches the limit 2 as w grows 
larger and larger. Figure 79 illustrates the same situation 
graphically. s. s,s,s, 

The notion of limits also presented itself to 1 2 

our attention in Arts. 87 and 89, when we ^^^' '^^ 

were concerned with the determination of the tangent at a 
given point of a curve. The theory of limits is of importance 
also in discussing the so-called incommensurable cases of 
elementary geoyietry and in the closely allied questions con- 
cerning irrational numbers. It also comes up in the men- 
suration of the circle. There are many other subjects in 
pure and applied mathematics in which the notion of limits 
is indispensable. The theory of infinite series, of which the 
geometric progression (1) is an illustration, is one of these. 
Since we wish to give a brief treatment of infinite series in 
this book, we must first discuss some of the more important 
questions which are connected with the notion of a limit. 

443 



444 LIMITS ^ . [AuT. 268 

268. Definition of a limit. The notion of a variable which 
approaches a limit is a fairly familiar one. Thus the sum 
*S'â€ž of n terms of the geometrical progression (1), Art. 267, 
approaches the limit 2. If Pâ€ž denotes the perimeter of a 
regular polygon of n sides circumscribed about a circle 
whose circumference is (7, Pâ€ž approaches Q as a limit. At 
the same time the area A^ of the polygon approaches the 
area A of the circle as a limit, and the same statements are 
true of the perimeters and areas of the regular inscribed 
polygons. When an automobile slows up and finally stops, 
it approaches its stopping place as a limit. If we prefer to 
think of the variable as a number^ we may, in this last'illus- 
tration, say that the distance from the starting place of the 
automobile approaches as a limit the distance from that point 
to the place where it stops. A pendulum which swings in a 
resisting medium like air approaches the vertical position as 
a limit. In Arts. 87 and 89 we developed the notion that a 
straight line which joins a fixed point of a curve to a mov- 
ing point of the same curve, approaches a limiting position, 
called a tangent of the curve, when the moving point ap- 
proaches the fixed point as a limit. 

In order that we may be able to reason logically about 
limits in general, we must think about these various 
instances, discover the essential feature which they all have 
in common, and then formulate a definition which shall 
cover them all. If we do this we are led to the following 
definition. 

A variable x is said to approach the constant a as a. limits if 
the law ivhich describes the variation of x is such, that the 
numerical value of the difference between a and x ivill ultimately 
become and remain smaller than any positive number which may 
have been assigned in advance. 

B}^ the numerical value of the difference between a and x 
we mean, as usual, the magnitude of this difference, no atten- 
tion being given to its si n. We shall denote the numerical 
value of this difference by the symbol \x â€” a|, as in Art. 17. 



Art. 268] DEFINITIOX OF A LIMIT 445 

The positive number assigned in advance, which is men- 
tioned in the definition, may be called 8. If we use these 
notations, we may reformulate our definition as follows: 

A variable x is said to approach the constant a as a limit, if 
the law according to ivhidi the. variable x changes is such as to 
insure that uldmately \x â€” a\ will become and remain less than 
ang positive number h which has been previously selected, and 
which mag be chosen as S)nall as we please. 

Thus, to test whether a variable x approaches a certain 
number a as a limit, we may proceed as follows : 

Step 1. Choose a positive number 8. It is understood 
that this number may, in particular, be chosen arbitrarily 
small. 

Step 2, Examine whether the law according to which 
the variation of x takes place will permit |a: â€” a| to become 
less than 8. 

Step 3. Examine the variation of x after this stage has 
been reached, to see whether ja; â€” a| will not merely become, 
but ever afterward remain, less than 8. 

Step 3 is very essential. Thus in the geometric progression 1, ^, \, \, â€¢â€¢â€¢ 
of Art. 2(57, the numerical value of Sâ€ž â€” 1-5/8 does become less than any 
positive number 8 for n = 4. In fact we have St â€” 15/8 = 0. But S^ 
does not approach 15/8 as a limit, since j S,, â€” 15/8 | does not remain 
less than 8 after n has increased beyond the value n = 4. 

In accordance with our definition x may approach the limit 
a from above, so that x â€” a is always positive, or from below, 
so that X â€” ah always negative. Or else x â€” a may be posi- 
tive during some of the stages of the approach and negative 
during others. Since the definition merely speaks about 
the numerical value of xâ€”a, all of these cases are equally 
admissible. 

The geometric progression of Art. 267 is an instance of a variable 
which approaches its limits from below. The area ^â€ž of a regular cir- 
cum.scribed polygon aj^proaclies the area of the circle from above. If we 
consider a sequence of regular polygons alternately inscribed and cir- 
cumscribed about a circle, the area of a polygon of this sequence also 



446 LIMITS [Art. 268 

approaches the circle, but alternately from below and above. The same 
thing is trne of a geometric progression whose common ratio is negative 
but numerically less than unity. 

Again, ovir definition says nothing about whether the variable 
reaches its limit or whether it does not. The variable S^ of 
Art. 267, , . 



'S'n = l+f,+ â€¢â€¢â–  + 



â€” 9 â€”

9n-l On-1 



never reaches its limit 2 for any value of n. Neither do the 
variables Pâ€ž or A^-, if Pâ€ž and J.â€ž denote the perimeter and 
area of the regular circumscribed n-gon. But an automobile 
not only approaches its stopping point as a limit, but reaches 
it. Therefore, the variable distance from a fixed starting 
point to an automobile approaches a7id reaches a limit when 
the automobile stops. 

Thus, a variable which approaches a limit, may or may not 
reach its limit.* 

It is true, however, that in many problems it is desirable, 
or even necessary, to think of the variable x as approaching 
its limit a without reaching it. But such a restriction, if 
desired, we shall add explicitly. It is not included auto- 
matically when we say that x approaches a as a limit. 

We use the symbols 

lim X = a (read the limit of x is eqnal to a), 
or X â€” ^a (read x approaches a as a litnit^, 

whenever we ivish to say that a variable x approaches a constant 
a as a limit. 

The definition of a limit leads at once to the following 
property, which is used very frequently. 

If trvo variables., x and y., simultaneously pass through the 
same values, so that x and y are equal to each other at each and 

* This remark is valid on the basis of the definition of limit as we have formu- 
lated it in tliis bool^. Some authors define a limit differently, including in their 
definition explicitly a statement that the variable shall not reach its limit. For 
some purposes this definition is preferable to ours. But it leads to some compli- 
cations which we prefer to avoid. 



Art. 269] IXFINITY 447 

every stage of their variation, then if one of these variables 
approaches a limit, so does the other, and their limits are equal. 
In symbols; if x = y, and if liin .v = Â«, theyi Vww y = a. 

269. Infinity. The simplest sequence of numbers is that 
of tlie positive integers 

(1) 1, 2, 3, ..., k, :.. 

According to our fundamental assumptions (see Arts. 1 and 
2), if k is a positive integer, no matter how large, there 
always exists another one still larger, namely ^ + 1. Con- 
sequently the sequence (1) has no last or largest number; 
it has no limit, it is unbounded. A variable which assumes 
such values is said to grow beyond bound, or to become 
infinite. 

j\Iore generally, if the law, according to ivhich a variable x 
changes, is such, that the numerical values of x ultimately he- 
come and remain greater than any positive number M chosen in 
advance, x is said to become infinite. This is often expressed 
by the symbols 

(2) lima:=x or x â€” >-xi. 

These symbolic statements are in common use, and we, therefore, find 
it necessary to become acquainted with tliem. It should be remembered, 
however, that, strictly speaking, the use of the symbol lim in this case is 
inappropriate. For when we write (2) we mean to indicate that x does 
not approach a limit, but grows numerically beyond bound. Tu fact, the 
word infinite means just this; unbounded or unlimited. 

In accordance with this dcluiition a variable x may become 
infinite by passing through a sequence of values such as (1), 
all of which are positive, or by passing through a sequence 
of values all of which are negative, or else by passing 
through values some of which are positive and some of 
which are negative. If we restrict the variation of x, by 
compelling x to assume only positive values while it is grow- 
ing beyond bound, we write 

lim X = -|- GO. 



448 . LIMITS [Arts. 270, 271 

Similarly, the symbolic equation 

lim X = â€” CO 

means that x grows beyond bound, exclusively through nega- 
tive values. This distinction is frequently very important. 

270. Infinitesimals. If a variable approaches zero for its 
limit, if. is called an infinitesimal. 

The following statements are immediate consequences of 
this definition. 

1. If X approaches the limit a then x â€” a is an infinitesimal. 

2. If X becomes infinite, the reciprocal of x is an infinitesimal. 

3. Ifx is an infinitesimal, the reciprocal of x becomes infinite. 

The last two statements are sometimes expressed symbolically by 

writing j ^ 

â€” = 0, - = CO. 
CO 

Literally these equations have no iiieauing, since division by zero is ex- 
cluded from algebra (Art. 21) and since the symbol -jo does not stand for 
a number. 

271. Variables which remain finite. If a variable x be- 
comes infinite it has no limit although we write symbolically 
lim X = cc . But a variable may remain finite and neverthe- 
less not approach a limit. Thus, if x assumes in succession 
the values +1, â€” 1, -f 1, â€” 1, and so on, it remains finite 
and nevertheless it does not approach a limit. 

A variable x, whether it approaches a limit or not, is s<tid to 
remain finite, if there exists a positive constant M, such that 

\x\ < M 

for all of those values which x may assume in accordance /rifh 
the law vhi'di regulates its variation. Such variables are also 
said to be bounded. 

In particular, a variable which approaches a limit may be 
regarded as belonging to this class of variables which remain 
finite. (See Art. 268.) An extremely special case of such 
a variable is a constant. 



Art. 27-2] A THEOREM ABOUT INFINITESIMALS 449 

272. A theorem about infinitesimals. The following theo- 
rem will tind frequent application in what follows. 

Let u and V he two infinitesimals, so that 

(1) lim u= 0, lini r = 0, 

and let X and Y he two variahles which remain finite. Then 
Xu + Yc trill he an infinitesimal, that is, 

(2) lim (Xu + Yv) = 0. 

Proof. Since X and Y remain tinite, there exists a finite 
positive number M, such that 

(3) \X\<M,^Y<M. (See Art. 271.) 

Since u and v are infinitesimals, we may choose a positive 
number 8, as small as we please, and then be sure that the 
values assumed by u and v will ultimately become and re- 
main so small that 

(4) I M I < 8, 1 1; I < 8. (See Art. 270.) 

As a consequence of (3) and (4) we shall have 

I Xu \<MS, \Yv\< MS, 
and therefore 

(5) \XuA-Yv\<\Xu\ + \Yv\<2 MS. (See Art. 22.) 

But the right member of (5) may be made smaller than any 
positive number S', no matter how small. To show this, we 
think of S' as being assigned first, as small as we please. 
Then, in the second place, we choose S, so that 

'<2M- 
Then we shall have 

(6) 2MS<S'. 

Thus, if u and v are infinitesimals and if X and Y remain 
finite, the inequalities (5) and (6) assure us that ultimately 



460 LIMITS [Art. 273 

I Xu + Yv I will become and remain less than h\ where S' is 
an arbitrarily small positive number. But this means that 
Xu + Yv approaches the limit zero (see Art. 268), so that 
Xu+ Yv is an infinitesimal. (Art, 270.) 

This theorem may obviously be extended to any sum com- 
posed of a finite number of terms, as follows. 

If Ui^ u^-, â€¢â€¢â€¢, Un <^'*^ a finite number of infinitesiinals, and if X^^ 
X^i â€¢â€¢â€¢ X,i are n variahles which remain finite, then X-^u^-^- X^u^ 
+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ + X,^nn is an infinitesimal. 

273. Theorems about limits. Let x and y he tivo variables, 
each of which approaches a limit, and let 

lim X = a, lim y = b. 

Then ive shall have 

(1) lim (.r + ?/) = a + ^ = lim x + lim y, 

(2) lim (x â€” y^= a â€” h = lim x â€” lim y, 

(3) lim xy = ab = (lim a:) (lim ?/). 

Proof. To prove (1) we put 
(4) u â€” X â€” a, V = y â€” b. 

Then u and v are infinitesimals. (Theorem 1, Art. 270.) We now 
apply the theorem of Art. 272 putting A' = Y= 1. We conclude that 
u + V will be an infinitesimal, that is, 

lim [.r - Â« + ?/ - i] = lim [./: + // - (a + b)'] = 0, 

proving that x + y ajijiroaches a + & as a limit. 

To prove (2) we use the conclusion from Art. 272 that u ~ v will be 
an infinitesimal. 

To prove (3) we write (4) as follows 

X = a + u, y = h +v, 
whence, xy = ab + bu + av + uv = ab + [bu + (a + u)v'\, 

or xy â€” ab = bu + (a + ii)i\ 

We may now apply the theorem of Art. 272, putting 
A' = b, Y = a + w, 

since ti and v are infinitesimals, so that A' and Y remain finite. We con- 
clude that xy â€” ab is an infinitesimal, and therefore 

lim xy = ab = (lim a;) (lim y). 



Art. 274] LIMIT OF A QUOTIENT 461 

Thus we have proved the following theorem. If each of 
two variables approaches a limit, so does their sum, their differ- 
ence, and their product. Moreover the limit of the snm of the 
variables is equal to the sum of their separate limits, and a 
similar statement holds for the limit of the difference and 
the limit of the p)roduct. 

It is obvious that this theorem may be extended to sums, 
differences, and products, composed of any finite number of 
terms or factors. From this remark we obtain the following 
simple corollaries. 

Cor. 1. If X approaches a as a limit, and if n is a positive 

integer^ then 

lim j;" = a" = (lim a:)". 

Cor. 2. If c is any constant.^ 

lim ex =: ca = c lim x. 

By combining these theorems in obvious fashion, we find 

Cor. 3. Let f(x) be any integral rational function of x, 
and let a be any finite number. If x varies in such a way as 
to approach a as a limit, then the corresponding values of f{x) 
will also approach a limit, and moreover 

lim/( a;) =/(Â«). 

274. Limit of the quotient of two variables. Let x and y 

be two variables which approach the limits a and b respect- 
ively. Then we may write 

X = a + u, y = b -\-v, 

where u and v are infinitesimals, and 

X _a -\-u 
y b -\-v 
Therefore 

m ^-'L = 'LÂ±JL^^=^''â€”Â£^=Xu+Yv, 

^ ^ y b b + v b bib + v^} 



452 LIMITS [Art. 274 

if we put 

C2\ X = Y = ~ ^ 

If b is not equal to zero, X and 1^ approach the limits 1/b 
tind â€” a/b"^ respectively, and therefore remain finite. (Art. 
271.) Consequently (See Art. 272) the right member of 
(1) is an infinitesimal, and we conclude 

(3) Inn - = - = it ^ ^ 0. 

7/ b lim ?/ 

This conclusion does not follow, by our method of proof, 
if 5 = 0. For in that case the variables X and Y, defined by 
(2), do iiot remain finite. But we may say more than that. 
The theorem certainly is not true when 6 = 0. For, in that 
case, lira y = 0, and equation (3) cannot be true, since the 
riglit member of (3) becomes meaningless when 5 = 0. 

We may express our result as follows: 

Theorem 1. If each of two variables approaches a limit, 
their quotient also approaches a limit, which is equal to the 
limit of the dividend divided by the limit of the divisor, 
provided that the latter limit is different from zero. 

This theorem and the above discussion should not be 
understood to imply that the quotient x/y may not have a 
limit, even if the limit of y is equal to zero. We have only 
asserted that this limit, if it exists, is not equal to 

lim X 
lim y 

since this last expression is meaningless when lim y = 0. 

Theokem 2. If the limit oj' y is equal to zero, the quotient 
x/y may or may not have a limit. The decision of this ques- 
tion, in any particular instance, depends upon the relation (if 
any') whi'-h exists between the laws accordiny to which the 
variables x and y pass through their various values. 

We certaiidy cannot expect x/y to ap})roach a limit if 
lim y = 0, and if x does not approach a finite limit. Let us 



Akt. 274] LIMIT OF A QUOTIENT 453 

then assume that x does approach a finite limit a which is 
different from zero. In this case x/y will become infinite. 

The following example will illustrate this statement. Let x assume 
in succession the following values 

x=\^y 1+1, l+L'-, l+l,liinx=l, 
2 4 8 2" 

and let the corresponding values of y be 

111 1 r A 

11= -, -. -, â€¢â€¢â€¢ â€” , lim M = 0.

Biity if X and y both (tpproacli the limit zero, it is impossible 
to say in general whether the quotient approaches a limit or not. 

Thus, let X assume the values

Thus, if both x and y approach the limit zero, the quotient

quotient x/y^ if both x and y approach zero as a limit, requires 
special investigation in every particular case.

vahie of r. Then we shall have 

lim |r"I = GO if |r| > 1, 
lim|r"l = l if |r| = l, 
lim|rÂ«| = if \r\ < 1. 

276. Continuity of a function. Let a and h, where b > a, 
be two real numbers. By the interval (a â€¢â€¢â€¢ b) we mean the 
assemblage of all real numbers between a and i, includ- 
ing the numbers a and b themselves. Any such number, 



456 



LIMITS 



[Art. 276 



excepting a and b, is said to be m the interior of the interval 
(a â€¢â€¢â€¢ b). 

Let JO represent any number in the interval (Â« â€¢â€¢â€¢ b^. We 
say that afunctio7i of x is defined for x= p, if it is clear from 
the definition of tlie function, as expressed by a formula or 
by some other description of the function, what tlie value of 
the function will be for re = p. The function is delined as 
a real oyie-valued, function for x = p if there is only one value 
prescribed for x = p and if this one value is a real number. 
Let y=f{x) be defined as a real one- 
valued function of x for all values of x in 
the interval (a â€¢â€¢â€¢ 6), and let us think of 
Fig. 80 as representing the graph of such 
rx a function, where we have made

sented by the ordinates AA', BB\ and XX' respectively, 

so that ^^, ^^^^^^ BB'^fib), XX' = fix). 

Let lis now pick out any particular point P of the interval 
AB, whose abscissa is p, so that 

a<p<h, fip)=FF'. 

If the curve is continuous or unbroken, as represented in the 
figure, it is clear that a variable ordinate XX' will approach 
the fixed ordinate PP' as a limit if X approaches P as a 
limit in any manner, that is, from the right, or from the left, 
continuously, or by a series of jumps. In other words we 
shall have 

(1) lini f(x) = f(p).

But if there is a break in the continuity of the curve at

trary fashion, partly from the right and partly from the left

Art. 27G] CONTINUITY OF A FUNCTION 457 

(as is permissible according to tlie definition of a limit), XX' 
will oscillate between values nearly equal to PP' and PP" 
respectively, and not approach any limit. 

We see that the possibility of such 
a break in the continuity of the graph 
is excluded if equation (1) is satisfied. 
This remark leads to the following defini- 
tion of continuity. 

A real one-valued fnnction f(x} is 
said to be continuous in the vicinity of a particular value 
x = p ii the following conditions are satisfied. 

1. The function f(x') is defined for t = p, that is, the defini- 
tion of the function assigns a unique definite finite value to the 
sijmhol fi^p}- This symbol f(^p) then represents a definite 
finite real number. 

2. TJie function f(^x) is defined for all values of x in the 
neighborhood of x = p, in such a tvay that when x approaches p 
as a limit, the function f{x) tvill approach one and the same 
definite finite number as a limit, 7io matter according to what 
particular laiv x may approach p. This is expressed by saying 
that the limit lim f(^x) exists. 

3. Finally, if the function is to be continuous, the condition 
lim f(x)=f{p^ must be satisfied. 

This last statement is read as follows; the limit of f(.r), as x aj> 
proaches p, is equal to f( p). 

If the function f(x') is defined only over a finite interval 
(a â€¢â€¢â€¢ /)) we should modify Part 2 of the above definition in 
the case p = a ov p = b. We shall say that lim f(x} exists 

if we obtain a definite finite limit for f(x) when x ap- 
proaclies a from above, since no other values of x would be 
admissible in su(;h a case. Similarly for lim/(.r). 

If a function f (^x') is continuous in the vicinity of every par- 
ticular value p which belongs to the interval (<*â€¢â€¢â€¢ 6), it is said 
to be continuous in the whole interval. 



458 LIMITS [Akt. 277 

We have seen in Art. 273 that, if fix) is an integral 
rational function of a:, then 

lira f<ix~)=f(p), 

if p is any finite number. Therefore we may now state the 
following theorem. 

An integral rational function of x is continuous for all finite 
values of x. 

This is a theorem which we have stated and used before. 
(See Art. 96.) But up to the present moment we have left 
it unproved. 

277. Continuity of a fractional rational function. Let us 
consider next a fractional rational function (see Art. 135), 

(1) R(^=^^ 

where /(a;) and g(x') are integral rational functions of x. 
If such a function is not continuous in the neighborhood of 
a particular value x = p, according to the definition of con- 
tinuity (Art. 276), this may be due to any one of the follow- 
ing reasons. 

1. The function may not be defined for x = p. 

2. The function may not have a limit when x approaches 
p. This may happen because tlie function grows beyond 
all bound when x approaches p, or because the limit is 
not the same when x approaches p in several different 
manners. 

3. The limit of R(x') as x approaches p may not be the 
same as the value -B(/') which is obtained by substituting 
x = p in the defining expression (1) of R(x). 

Let us examine these possibilities. Since f(x) and g (x') 
are integral rational functions, they are defined for all finite 
values of x. Therefore M(x), their quotient, will be defined 
for all values of x except for those which cause the divisor 
g(x^ to assume the value zero. (See Art. 21.) l^et x = p 
be such a value of x, so that g(^p^= 0. If the rational func- 



Art. 277] CONTIXriTY OF A RATIONAL FUXCTIOX 459 

tion is in its lowest terms (see Art. 137) we shall then have 
/(jy)9tO, and x = p will be a pole of the fractional function 
rIx). CSee Art. 130.) In that case 

(1) lim It{x)= 00 ; 

in other words, IK^x} has no finite limit as x approaches p. 

Therefore, a fractional rational function is discontinuous in 

the neighborhood of any one of its poles. 

If the denominator g{x^ is not equal to zero for x = p, we 

have 

lim /(a:) 

(2) lim i^(.r) = f^^^L^ (Theorem 1, Art. 274.) 

But since /(a;) and (/(^x) are integral rational functions, and 
are, therefore, continuous for all finite values oi x (Art. 276), 
we have further 

lim/(a:) = /(^), lim g(x) = g(p)=^0. 

x-^p x-^p 

(Art. 276, Definition of a continuous function.) 
Consequently we find from (2), 

lim i2 (a:) = ^^^ = i^ ( 7^) . 

But this means, according to the definition (Art. 276), that 
R(x) is continuous in the neighborhood of x = p. 

We have proved the following theorem. A fractional 
rational function of x in its lowest terms is continuous in the 
neighborhood of every finite value of x, excepting only those 
which cause the denominator to assume the value zero.

278. Indeterminate forms. We may summarize the prin- 
cipal results of Art. 277 as follows. If R{x) is a rational 
function of x, written in its lowest terms, and if x ajjproaches 

the limit p, then ^ 

^ lim B(x) = Jl(p). 

Unless JO is a pole of RQx'), this limit will be a definite finite 
number. 

If R(x') is a rational function which is not in its lowest 
terms, and if we write /.^ x 

then /(a;) and gQx'), the numerator and denominator of 
IK^x^, will have a common factor dependinq- upon x. If we 
divide botli numerator and denominator of R(^x^ by tlieir 
highest common factor, we sliall obtain a new rational func- 
tion R^ix) which in in its lowest terms, and we shall have 

(1) IKx) = R,(x-) 

for all of tliose values of x for which this reduction is legiti- 
mate, that is, for all values of x except those whi.cli cause 



Art. 278] INDETERMINATE FORMS 461 



the liigliest common factor of f(x) and gi^x) to assume the 
value zero. 

a;2 _ 4 
Thus, the function R(x^ â€” â–  

is equal to -'^iC^) = x + 2 



for all values of x except for x = 2. For x = 2 these two functions are 
not equal, since the function /2(x) assumes the form ()/() for x = 2, 
and therefore is not defined for x = 2, while the value of Ri(x) for x ~ 2 
is 2 + 2 = 4. 

But for all values of x, with this one exception, we have 

= X + 2. 

X â€” 4 

If therefore we allow x to approach the limit 2, with the specification 
that X shall approach 2 tvithout reaching this limit, we shall have 

x'^ 4 

lim â€” = liin (x + 2) = 4 (see theorem at end of Art. 2G8). 

x-^-2 X â€” 2 x^l 

This example is typical of a large and important class of 
cases. We have given a rational function R(x) which is 
not in its lowest terms. Consequently there are certain 
values of x, which cause both the numerator and denomina- 
tor of Rix) to vanish. Let x=p\ie one of these values of 
X. The function R(x) then assumes the form 0/0 for x=p 
and is therefore not defined for x=p. Consequently the 

statement 

\m\f{x) 
\imRix)= ^r> =.^ 

x^p lim g{x) 

would be meaningless. The question is : lias R(t) a limit 
when X approaches p, and if so what is the value of this 
limit '? 

We proceed as in the illustrative example. Reduce R{^x) 
to its lowest terms and let R-^{x) be the resulting fraction. 
We shall have 
(1) i2(^) = B,^(x) 

for all values of x in tlie ueigliborhood of x = p^ excepting 
only the value x = p itself. If x approaches j3 in such a way 



462 LIMITS [Art. 278 

as not to assume the value p during the approach, we shall 
have (Final Theorem Art. 268) 

(2) \{mR{x) = \imR^(x). 

But we have further either 

(3) \\m R^{x^ = R^{p) 

or 

(4) lim R-^(x^ = 00 

x-^p 

according as R-^(x)^ which is in its lowest terms, is con- 
tinuous in the neighborhood oi x=p or else has 2;=^ as 
a pole. By combining (2) with (3) or (4) we obtain the 
desired limit. 

In Art. 87 and Art. 89 we introduced the notion of the derivative 
of a function. The variable whicli takes the j^lace of the a: of this 
article is the h which occurs there. Observe that we are there dis- 
cussing a problem of just the kind treated in the present article. 
This remai"k will serve to convince the student of the importance of 
such limits. 

The following examples will illustrate how to treat other 
cases in which the direct application of the theorems on 
limits of Arts. 273 and 274 give indeterminate or meaning- 
less results.

Alt. 60 that the sum of n terms of a geometric progression 
a, ar, ar^, â€¢â€¢. could be expressed in the form 

(1) S, = j^-^-

If r is numerically less than unity, that is, if | r | < 1, we saw, 

in Art. 275, that 

lim I r" 1 = 0, 

so that 

(2) S = \\m Sâ€ž = -^^ if I r ! < 1.

S is then said to be the sum of the nonterminating geo- 
metric progression. (See also Art. 62.)

281. Convergence and divergence of infinite series. We 

now proceed to generalize the notions encountered in Arts. 
279 and 280. Let Mj, u^, %, â€¢â€¢â€¢ be the terms of a non-termi- 
nating or infinite series, and let us denote by *S'â€ž the sum of 
the first n terms, so that 

S^ = Mj, S^ = U^ + U^i >S3 = U^ -{- U^ + W3, â€¢Â»â€¢, 

S^ = Wj + y.2 + W3 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + "â€ž-i + wâ€ž. 

Clearly the value of >S'â€ž will depend, in the first place, upon 
the nature of the series under consideration, that is, upon the 
law of formation of its terms, and, in the second place, upon 
the number of terms included in S^. We express this by 
saying that /S'â€ž is a function of n. 

If the sum of the first n terms of an infinite series approaches 
a definite finite limit as n grows beyond hound, that is, if 

lim S, = S 

ivhere S is a definite finite number, the infinite series 

Mj -I- â– ?^3 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ to infinity 

is said to be convergent, and the limit S is said to be its sum. 

If the series is not convergent, /S'â€ž will not approach a defi- 
nite finite limit as n grows beyond bound, and we shall say 



Art. 281] CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE 467 

that the series is divergent. There are two chisses of diver- 
gent series ; those of the first class for wliich *S'â€ž becomes in- 
finite when n grows beyond bound ; and those of the second 
class for which *S'â€ž does not approach a definite finite number 
as a limit although 8^ does not become infinite. Series of 
the latter class are often called oscillating series. To avoid 
confusion, the student should note that some authors use the 
word divergent only for the case when lim >S'â€ž = oo. 

The word sum is here used in a new sense. (Compare also Art. 62.) 
Our original definition of a sum (Art. 2) only applies to the case where 
the number of terms is finite. The sum of an infinite series, as here 
defined, is not a sum at all iu the original sense of the word; it is the 
limit which such a sum approaches when the number of terms grows 
beyond bound. 

Example 1. The geometric progression 

1 + * + i + i + - 
is a convergent infinite series. The sum of the first n terms is 

^ - ^ ^/^" (See (1), Art. 279), 



so that 



proving that the series is convergent and that its sum is equal to 2. 

Figure 82 illustrates graphically how it happens that .S",, approaches the 
finite limit 2. The distance OB is equal to two units. The distances 
OSo, OSz, OSi, and so on represent the sum of two, 

three, four, â€¢â€¢â€¢ terms of the series respectively, and ^ '^ â€” >^-^' 

it is evident from the figure that 05â€ž has OB as p^^ g2 

its limit. 

We have seen more generally, in Art. 279, that any geometric progres- 
sion, whose constant ratio is numerically less than unity, forms a convergent 
series, whose sum is equal to 

1-r 

Example 2. Each of the series of Art. 280 is convergent. Their 
sums are 1, i, and ^ respectively.

468 mrmiTE series [Art. 282 

Example 3. The series 1 + 1 + 1 4- â€¢â€¢â€¢ + 1 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ is divergent. For, 
in this case 5â€ž = n and therefore Sâ€ž grows beyond bound as n becomes 
infinite. 

Example 4. The series 1 â€” 1 + 1 â€” 1 + 1 â€” l+--is also divergent. 
But in this case Sâ€ž does not become infinite. In fact Sâ€ž is equal to zero 
when n is even, and S,^ is equal to 1 when n is odd. As n grows beyond 
bound, S^ oscillates between the two values and 1. It does not be- 
come infinite, but neither does it approach a limit. The series is an 
oscillating one. 

The method of investigation illustrated so far is applicable 
whenever we actually know how to find an exact and simple 
expression for Sâ€ž^ the sum of the first n terms of the given 
series. This is one of the reasons why it is a matter of great 
importance to be able to find the sum of a finite series. (See 
Arts. 262 to 266.) Moreover in all such cases we can do 
more than merely decide the question as to whether a series 
is convergent or divergent. If it is convergent, we can ac- 
tually find its sum. 

EXERCISE CXXIX

282. Fundamental criteria for convergence. Whenever we 
have no explicit formula for *S'â€ž we cannot decide whether a 
series is convergent or divergent by the method of Art. 281. 
We must therefore seek for more general methods. 

Let the series 

(1) u^ + ^2 + ^3-1- â€¢â€¢â€¢ 

be convergent. Let S be the sum and let S^ be the sum of 
its first n terms. Then >S' â€” *S'â€ž must approach the limit zero 



Art. 282] FUNDAMENTAL CRITERIA 469 

when )i grows beyond bound, and the same thing must be 
true of Sâ€”Sn-y Consequently the difference 

must also approach zero as a liuiit. But 

lS'â€ž = Wj + Wg -+- â€¢ â€¢ â–  + Wn-1+ "n^ 

SO that S^ â€” Sn-i is equal to mâ€ž. Consequently we obtain 
the following result. 

Theore^ni I. If a series is convergent its nth term must 
approach the limit zero ^ when n grows beyond hound; that is ^ 
the condition 

(2) lim Mâ€ž = 

must he fulfilled if the series (1) is to he convergent. 

The condition (2) is necessary for convergence^ hut hy no 
means sufficient. In other words, it may happen that con- 
dition (2) is satisfied and that the series is nevertheless 
divergent. 

Such is the case, for instance, for the following series, the so-called 
harmonic series, 

(3) i + J + i+l+-. 
In this case we have 

w,^ = â€” and lim Un = liin - = 0, 
n Â«->-Â» ?Â»->Â« n 

but the series is nevertheless divergent, as we shall now show. 
We may write (3) as follows : 

(4) 1 + ^ + (1- + \) + {\ + i + ^ + 1) + (i + A + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + h) + â– â– ; 
where the terms are collected in groups of one, two, four, eight, and so 
on in accordance with a law which is easily recognizable. Not counting 
the first term at all, the first group consists of a single term 1/2. The 
sum of the terms of the second group is 

I + \, which is greater than ^ + ^ or ^. 
The sum of the terms of the third group 

^ + I + J + ^ is greater than ' + J + 1 + i, Â«â€¢ e. greater than \. 



470 INFINITE SERIES [Art, 282

Each of these terms is greater than the last, whose value is equal to

Om-l _|_ >2m"l ~~ 2 â€¢ 2"'~1 ~ 2â„¢ * 

The sum of the terms of the mth group is, of course, greater than the num- 
ber of these terms multiplied by the value of the smallest one among 
them, that is, greater than 

2m 2 

Consequently, if we denote by Sm the sum of those terms of (4) which 
are included in the first m groups, we have 



(5) .Sâ€ž > 1 + 



o' 



since the sum of the terms in each group is greater than 1/2. But 
according to (5), Sm becomes infinite when m grows beyond bound, that 
is, when n becomes infinite. Therefore the series (3) is divergent. 

We have seen that the condition (2) is necessary, but not 
sufficient for the convergence of an infinite series. The fol- 
lowing theorem gives a condition which is both necessary 
and sufficient ; but we shall merely state this theorem with- 
out proof since the proof is a little difficult for a beginner. 

Theoreisi II. In order that the series 

Wj -f ^2 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ 
may he convergent, it is necessary and sufficietit that, not only 
the nth term, but the sum of any number of terms following the 
7ith term shall approach the limit zero when n grows beyond 
hound.

283. Series all of whose terms are positive. We shall 
assume the following theorem without proof. The student 
will easily convince himself of its great plausibility. 

Theore:si I. If all of the terms of a series are positive, it 
cannot he an oscillating series. It is either convergent, or else 
the sum of the first n terms will become infinite as n groivs be- 
yond bound. 

We may also formulate this statement as follows. 

Theore^f II. An infinite series of positive terms is con- 
vergent if Sn remains finite for all values of n, that is, if there 
exists a finite positive number M, such that >S'â€ž < M for all 
values of n, no matter how great. 

For according to Theorem I, such a series is either con- 
vergent, or else 

lim >S'â€ž= 30. 

But the latter possibility is excluded if >S'â€ž < J/ for all values 
of n. 

EXERCISE CXXXI 

1. Formulate the theorems which correspond to Tlieorem T and 11 in 
tlie case of series all of whose terms are negative. 

284. Comparison tests. The method outlined in the fol- 
lowing theorem often enables us to prove the convergence of 
a given series, by comparing it with another series whose 
convergence has been established previously. 

Theorem I. Let it be known that the series of positive terms 

(1) ^1+ ^2 + ^'3 -â€¢-â€¢â€¢â€¢+ ^'n+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ 

is convergent, and let 

(2) ?/l + W2 + W3+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ +Mn+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ 

be a second series of positive terms, ivhose convergence is to be 
tested. If 

(3) wâ€ž ^ vâ€ž, 



472 INFINITE SERIES [Art. 285 

for all of those values of n which follow a certain first value of 
n for which the inequality/ (3) is fulfilled, the series (2) is con- 
vergent. 

Proof. Since the series ?'i + re + â€¢â€¢â€¢ is convergent, the sura of any 
number of its terms following its nth. term will approach zero as n grows 
beyond bound. (See Theorem II, Art. 282.) Therefore we can make 
the sum of the p terms which follow râ€ž, that is, 

Â»"n+l + ''n+2 + â€¢â€¢â–  + Vn-^p, 

arbitrarily small by choosing n large enough. (See Art. 268, definition 
of a limit.) We may also assume that Â»i has been chosen so large as to 
insure at the same time the validity of all of the inequalities 

We shall then have 

Wn+l + Un+2 + â€¢â€¢â–  + Mâ€ž+p < l'â€ž+l + Vâ€ž+2 + â€¢" + Vn+p. 

But this means that m + U2 + â€¢â– â–  + uâ€ž+p may be made arbitrarily small by 
choosing n large enough. In other words, the sum uâ€ž+i + uâ€ž+2 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + Â«n+p 
will approach the limit zero as ?i grows beyond bound, no matter how 
large or small j3 may be. But this means that the series wi + W2 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ is 
convergent. (See Theorem II, Art. 282.) 

Theorem II. Let the series of positive terms v^ + v.^+ â– â€¢â€¢ 
he divergent, and let 

II ^ v 

"n ^ '^n 

for all of those values of n which follow a certain first value of n 
for which this inequality is fulfilled. Then the series u-^ + u^-\- â€¢â– â€¢ 
is also divergent. 

For, if this were not so, that is, if u^ + u^ + â€¢â€¢â€¢ were con- 
vergent, according to Theorem J, v-^ + v^+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ woukl also be 
convergent contrary to our assumption. 

285. Some convenient comparison series. In order to be 
able to apply Theorems I and II of Art. 284, it is necessar}' 
to have some series at our disposal whose convergence or 
divergence has already been established. We have found 
some such series already. (See Arts. 279 and 280.) More- 
over, as soon as we have proved some new series to be 



Art. 285] SOME CONVENIENT COMPARISON SERIES 473 

either convergent or divergent by this method we may make 
use of it for the purpose of examining still other series. 

The following theorem is particularly useful in connection 
with the comparison tests. 

The series 

(1) T- + ^ + ^ + -r+- +-+â€¢â€¢â€¢ 

iP 2p 8p 4p 7t" 

iH convergent wlien p > 1. It is diveryent when p = 1, or ichcn 
p < 1. 

Proof. We have already shown that this series is divergent for /> = 1 
since in tliat case it reduces to the harmonic series 

(2) 1+1 + 14-1+ ... +1+.... 

L: o 4 n 

(Compare Art. 282.) 

if yj < 1, we iiave n'><.n for all values of n except for n â€” 1. (See 
Theorem V, Art. 1(>3.) Therefore 

->1, for n =2,3, 1. â€¢â€¢â€¢, 

nP n 

so that Theorem II of Art. 281 assures us that the series (1) is divergent 
for p < 1 . 

It remains only to show that (1) is convergent when p > 1. To do 
this we arrange the terms of (1) in groups of two, four, eight, and so on, 
as we did in Art. 282 for the harmonic series. 

We have 

2p ;ip 2p 2p-i' 

4p op Op 7p 4p 4p~^ 

1 + i- -L <ii= J_ 



From these iuequalities we conclude. l)y addition, 

('i>,\ -!- + _ + _+ ... <'_J__ + ^ + â– *â–  + ... 

^* ^ ^p^p^p 2P-1 <^p-\ %p-^ 

But the right member of (3) is a geometric progression whose first term 
is a = 1/2''-^ and whose common ratio is r = 1/2''-^ This progression 
is a convergent series if the common ratio is less than unity, that is, if p 



474 INFINITE SERIES [Art. 286 

is greater than one. Therefore, the series in the left member of (3) is 
convergent if jo > 1, as was to be proved. 

We may even draw a further conclusion. The sum of the non-termi- 
nating geometric progression in the right member of (3) is 

1

286. Ratio test. Of all of the tests which we shall give 
in this book, the following is the most important. 

Theorem I. Let u^ + n^ + u^ + â€¢â€¢â€¢ he an infinite series all 
of whose terms are positive^ and let us consider the ratio of the 
(n + lyth term to the nth term of the series, that is, the ratio 
Wn+i/**n- ^ ^^^'^ ratio approaches a limit ivhen n groivs beyond 
bounds and if lim mâ€ž+i/wâ€ž < 1, the series is convergent. 



Art. 286] RATIO TEST 475 

If lim wâ€ž+i/?/â€ž > 1, tlie series is divergent. The question 

of convergence or divergence remains undecided by this test, if 
either lim mâ€ž+i/?/â€ž = 1, or if Un+i/Un does not approach any 

definite limit as n groivs beyond hound. 

Proof. Let us consider first the case when 
lim ^^2+1 < 1. 

Â»!â€”><Â» Uy^ 

Let us denote by r the limit of wâ€ž-f.i/Mâ€ž, so that 
(1) lim^*2+l = r< 1. 

According to the definition of a limit, tlie meaning of (1) 
may also be stated as follows. Let us consider the sequence 
of ratios 

-^â– , -^, -^, 'â€¢'â– , 

W'-f Wrt It'O 

and let us choose a positive number S, which may be taken 
as small as we please. Then there will present itself sooner 
or later a first one of these ratios, say 



which differs from r by less then 8, and such that wâ€ž+i/mâ€ž for 
all values of n which are greater than m will also differ from 
r by less than 8. 

Thus, after B has been chosen, m can be determined in such 
a way that all of the ratios 

*, â–  Â«, ..., ', ... 

will be included between r â€” 8 and r + 8. Since r was, by 
hypothesis, less than unity, and since 8 was a positive number 
which could be chosen arbitrarily small, we may in particular 
choose 8 in such a way that r -\- 8 will also be less than unity. 



476 INFINITE SERIES [Art. 286 

In Fig. 83 the line-segment OU is one unit long, and 07? = r rep- 
resents the limit, less than unity, which u,^^Ju^ approaches as n grows 
beyond bound. If 8 is chosen as a positive number 

f\ J Tf "K XJ 

^ ^iÂ» r r+l \ such that ?â€¢ -f S is still less than unity, the line-seg- 

â€ž â€žâ€ž ments OL and OK represent the numbers ?â€¢ â€” 8 and 

Fi<3. 83 â€ž . 

r 4- o respectively. The statement that Â«â€ž n/",, ap- 
proaches r as a limit is equivalent to saying that the various line-segments 
which represent the quotients Mâ€žr]/wâ€ž for growing values of n will ap- 
proach OR as a limit, so that if m is taken large enough, all of the 
quotients wâ€ž+i/wâ€ž, for which n exceeds m, will lie between OL and OK. 

Now let us put r + S = A". Then A; < 1, and we have 
(2) ?^^tt2<^A-, 



m+l 



^^A;, 



'm+2 



and so on. But from (2) we find 



â– ^m+i ^ "^wâ€ž 



\6) "MTO+ajS-^^m+i^^ ^TO? 

and so on. If we compare the sum of the left members of 

(3) to the sum of the right members, we conclude 

(4) w,â€ž+j -f w,â€ž+2 + ^â„¢+3 + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ :4 w^(^ + A'- + F -f â€¢ â€¢ â€¢). 

Since k is less than unity, the geometric progression in the 
right member of (4) is convergent. Consequently the series 
Wm+i + wâ€ž+2 + 'â– â–  ^^ convergent. If we add to this series the 
first 7W terms u^ + u^-\- â– â– â€¢ -}- wâ€ž, we alter the value of the sum, 
but the series will remain convergent. 

Thus we have proved that our series u^-\-u<^-\- â€¢â€¢â€¢is con- 
vergent if 

lim ^^^ < 1. 

If instead 

lini !^2+l = r > 1, 

nâ€” >.oc Wâ€ž 



Art. 286] RATIO TEST 477 

a slight modification of our argument shows that vi may be 
chosen so large that u,n+\/'^m ^^^ 3-^1 of the ratios mâ€ž+i/wâ€ž for 
which n > m will be greater than unity. 

In Fig. 83 the point R would be to the right of U and both points L 
and K will be to the right of [/ if S is chosen sufficiently small. 
Thus we shall have in this case 

and so on, so that 

liroving that w^ + Wj + â€¢â€¢â€¢ must be divergent if 

lim ^fiiÂ±i>l. 

nâ€” >Â« Wâ€ž 

This last argument enables us to complete our theorem by the follow- 
ing statement : 



If 



lim ^^5+1 = ^ = 1, 



hut if all of the ratios of the sequence 



*'TO+l "'m+2 "'m+3 
Urn Um^ I Ufn+2 



which folloiv a certain first one u^j^jum^ are greater than or 
equal to unity, then we may still assert that the series is 
divergent. 

But the ratio test gives us no information whatever in case 
lim ?^^ = r = 1, 

n->oo Un 

while all of the ratios of the sequence 

are less than unity. Such a series may be convergent or 
diverofent. 



478 INFINITE SERIES [Art. 286 

Thus the harmonic series 

'J o n 

is known to be divergent. In this case we have 



Mâ€ž n + \ n n + \ 1j-1 

n 

This ratio is less than unity for all values of n, but it approaches unity as 
a limit. The reason that the proof of convergence for the case 

lim ^/i+i â€” ^^1 

is not applicable to this series is easily seen. Although we have 

!fÂ»Â±i<l 

for all values of n, we cannot assert that there exists a fixed number 
A;< 1, the same k for all values of n, such that 

In fact, since Un+Ju,^ appi'oaches 1 as a limit, we know that no such 
number k exists which is less than 1. Consequently the argument based 
upon the inequalities (2), (3), and (4) fails to prove convergence of the 
series since the lowest value of k which we can use in this case is ^ = 1, 
and not a value of k which is less than 1. But for A- = 1 the series in 
the right member of (4) is divergent, and consequently the inequality (4) 
fails to prove that the left member is a convergent series. 

It may happen, however, that a series is convergent although the 
limit of uâ€ž^.j/wâ€ž is equal to unity. This is the case in the series 

We proved in Art. 285 that this series is convergent. But we have 

^5+1= 1 . 1 ^ n2 ^ n^ 1 

Mâ€ž {n + iy- ' n^~ {n + \y^ n2 + 2 ?i + 1 j ^ 2 ^ J_ 

n n^ 
and this approaches unity as a limit when n grows beyond hound. 

Thus we have the following result. 

Theorem II. Ifu^^Ju^ does not tend toivard a definite finite 
limit or if lim Ur^Ju^ = 1, then the ratio test fails to decide the 



Art. 287] RATIO OF TERMS OF TWO SERIES 479 

question zvhetker the series of positive terms u^ + U2+ u^+ â– â– â–  
is convergent or divergent. 

Of course such a series will actually be either convergent or divergent. 
We are merely asserting that the ratio test, in such cases, is powerless to 
decide the question and that a decision must be souglit by some other 
method. 

The limit lim wâ€ž+i/?^â€ž = /' is often called the test ratio, al- 

though it is really no ratio at all, but the limit which a cer- 
tain ratio approaches when n grows beyond bound.

287. Ratio of corresponding terms of two series. The fol- 
lowing theorem is convenient in many cases. 

Let the ratio of the nth terms of two series of positive terms 
he finite and different from zero for all values of n, and let this 
ratio approach a limit, ivhen n groivs beyond bound, which is 
also finite arid different from zero. Tfien either both series are 
convergent, or else both are divergent. 

Proof. Let 

(1) Ui + ^2 + W3 + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + Un + â€¢ â€¢â€¢ 

and 

(2) v^ + v^ + v^+ ... +t^â€ž+.-. 

be the two series under consideration, every term of each 
series being positive. Let us assume that Mâ€ž/yâ€ž is finite and 



480 INFINITE SERIES [Art. 287 

different from zero for all values of n and that this ratio 
approaches a limit 

lim ^ = k, 

which is finite and different from zero. We wish to prove 
tliat, under these conditions, (1) and (2) are either both 
convergent or else both divergent. 
Put 

(3) Sn = U^ + ^2 + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + M.â€ž, 

(4) ASV = Vl + f2+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ + ^'n, 

and let 

According to our hypothesis, r j, r^, â€¢â€¢â€¢ râ€ž are finite positive 
numbers, all different from zero. Let us denote by râ€ž' the 
smallest and by R^ the greatest of these n numbers. Then 
we shall have 

or 

(6) rjv^ ^ ^1 ^ ^n'^r â€¢ â€¢ â€¢' ^nVr, ^ Wâ€ž ^ RJVr,. 

From these inequalities we find by addition 

or, making use of (3) and (4), 

(7) r^S^^S^SRuSr!. 

The values of râ€ž' and RJ will ordinarily be different for 
different values of n. But, according to our assumptions, 
all of these numbers will be finite and different from zero. 
Consequently there will exist two finite numbers different 
from zero, r and 72, such that the inequalities 

(8) r^r^ and R^Rr! 
will be satisfied for all values of n. 



Art. 287] RATIO OF TERMS OF TWO SERIES 481 

The ouly thing wliich could interfere with the existence of two such 
numbers would be the possibility that wâ€ž/râ€ž might approach the limit 
zero or become infinite. But both of these possibilities are excluded 
by the hypothesis that this limit should be finite and not zero. 

From (7) and (8) we can conclude 



whence, since SJ is positive and surely not equal to zero, 

(9) r<Â§^,<R. 

Thus, the ratio of S^ to SJ will lie between the two positive 
numbers r and M for all values of n. 

Since all of the terms of (1) are positive, (1) cannot be 
an oscillating series. Consequently *S'â€ž will either approach 
a finite limit as n grows beyond bound, or else Sâ€ž will be- 
come infinite. (See Theorem I, Art. 283.) The same thing 
is true of *S'â€ž'. Since *S'â€ž' cannot have zero as a limit, every 
one of its terms being positive, we have 

a lim *S'â€ž 

â€ž_^^ SJ lim *S'â€ž' ' 

n-<â€” 00 

and therefore we conclude from (9), 

lim *S'â€ž 

aO) r^r^^^^â€”-<B. 

lim .Sâ€ž' â€” 

n > j : 

If *S'â€ž has a finite limit, the same thing must be true of SJ. 
For, as we have just noted, S^ either has a finite limit or 
becomes infinite, and the latter possibility would contradict 
the inequality (10). A similar contradiction would arise if 
lim *S'â€ž = X unless we have also lim Sâ€ž' = ^. 

Thus our theorem is proved.

288. Series with positive and negative terms. Clearly the 
criteria which we have developed for series all of whose 
terms are positive are applicable, with very minor changes, 
to series all of whose terms are negative, or to series all of 
whose terms, excepting only a finite number, have the same 
sign. We may make use of these criteria also for many 
series which contain an infinite number of terms of either 
sign, as a consequence of the following theorem. 

Theorem I. An infinite series u^ + u<^+ %+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ whose terms 
are all real, but not necessarily/ all positive, will be convergent, 
if the series of positive terms, 

composed of the absolute values of the terms of the original 
series, is convergent. 

Proof. Let 

/^â– v <Sâ€ž = Ml + Â«2 + â€¢â– â€¢ + Mâ€ž. 

2â€ž =|in| + |r<2| + â€¢â€¢â€¢ +1 wâ€žI- 

The sum of any number of terms, say p terms, of wj + W2 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ which 
follow the ?ith term mâ€ž is 

(2) Wâ€ž + l + "n+2 + â€¢â€¢â€¢ + Un+p. 

The numerical value of this sum will be smaller than or at most equal to 

(3) |Wn+l!+ |Mn + 2(+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ + I "n+p|, 

since the corresponding terms of the two sums, (2) and (3), are numeri- 
cally equal to each other, and since all terms of (3) are positive while 
(2) may contain positive and negative terms. But, whatever value p 
may have, the sum (3) will approach the limit zero as n grows beyond 
bound, since the series 

|wi l + l W2I+ â€¢â€¢â€¢ 



Art. 288] ABSOLUTELY CONVERGENT SERIES 



483 



is convergent by hypothesis. (Theorem II, Art. 282.) Consequently 
the sum (2), whose numerical value is at most ecjual to that of the sum 
(8), will also approach the limit zero as n^ grows beyond bound. But 
this means (Theorem II, Art. 282) that the series 

Ul + U2+U3 + â€¢â€¢â–  

is convergent, as was to be proved. 

A series of this sort, wliich is not merely convergent, but 
which has the further property tliat the series composed of 
the absolute values of its terms is also convergent, is said to 
be absolutely convergent. 

The ratio test (see Art. 286) may now be extended so as 
to become applicable to series whose terms are not all positive. 

Theorem II. The series Ui + U2+ â€¢â€¢â€¢, whose terms need 
not all have the same sign, is convergent if 



It is divergent if

and we have seen (see Art. 282) that in any convergent series the limit

we found before. (Theorem II, Art. 286.)

289. Conditionally convergent series. A series with posi- 
tive and negiitivo terms may be convergent although it is 
not absolutely convergent. (See the definition of absolute 
convergence in Art. 288.) Such series are said to be con- 
ditionally convergent. A simple illustration of a condition- 
ally convergent series will be given in the next article. 

290. Alternating series. An alternating series is one 
whose terras are alternately positive and negative. If Wj, Wgi 
Wg, W4, â€¢â€¢â€¢ denote positive numbers, 

(1) Wj â€” W2 + Wg â€” M4 -H W5 â€” Wg -I 1 â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 

is an alternating series. Any alternating series may be 
expressed either in the form (1) or else in the form 

(2) â€” (Wj â€” M2 + Wg â€” 7/4-I â€” â€¢â€¢â– ). 

Since (1) and (2) are convergent or divergent at the same 
time, it sujBfices to consider a series of form (1). We have 
the following theorem due to Leibniz : 

An alternating series is convergent if each term is numericalli/ 
less than the preceding one, and if the nth term of the series 
approaches the limit zero when n becomes infinite. 

PuooK. Let j/j. u^, Â«.. â€¢â€¢â€¢ be positive numbers, such that

(6) S^ = "1 - (",, - W3) - ("4 - W5) ("Â«-2 - "Â«-i) - ""â€¢ 



Art. 291] SERIES OF FUNCTIONS 485 

Again each of the differences inclosed in a parenthesis is positive, so 
that (6) tells us that 

(7) Sâ€ž<u,. 
Tlius the series whose terms are 

Ui â€” w,, M3 â€” W4, J'a â€” Uf., â– â€¢â–  

has all of its terms positive, and there exists a positive finite number, 
namely Ui, such that the sum of any number of terms of this series is less 
than Ml- Consequently (see Theorem II, Art. 28:3), tliis series of posi- 
tive terms is convergent. 

In other words, the sum of an even number of terms of our alternating 
series approaches a definite finite limit S, if the number of terms, always 
remaining even, grows beyond bound. Thus, if n is even, we have 

(8) lim Sâ€ž = S.

But if n is even, n â€” 1 is odd, and we have

on account of (4) and (8). Thus 5,, approaches the same definite finite 
limit S whether n be even or odd, and therefore the alternating series is 
convergent.

and divergent for others. If it is convergent for two differ- 
ent values of x^ x = a and x = b, we may expect it to have 
different sums in the two cases. 

All of those values of x for which a series of the form (1) 
is convergent, are said to constitute its domain of conver- 
gence. For all values of x in its domain of convergence, the 
series defines a function of x. 

292. Power series. The simplest and most important 
case of this kind is that of a power series 

Uq -{- a^x -\- a^x^ + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ -H Â«â€ža;" -|- â€¢â€¢â€¢, 

every term of which is a product of a constant aâ€ž (whose 
value depends upon n but not upon x} multiplied by the 
power x", n being a positive integer. 

The nth and (^n -\- l)th terms of such a power series are 

Mâ€ž = aâ€ž_ja:"~i and mâ€ž^j = aâ€ža:;". 

These terms may be positive or negative even if aâ€ž_j and aâ€ž 
are both positive, since x may be positive or negative. If 
we wish to apply the ratio test, we must therefore use it in 
the extended form of Art. 288. We have

It may happen that

does not approach any definite limit, finite or infinite. In 
that case our theorem conveys no inforjnation. But if such 
a limit exists, we have the following results: If the value 
of r obtained from (2) is zero, the power series is divergent 
for all values of x except for a:=0. If r is infinite, the series 
is convergent for all finite values of x. If r is finite and 
different from zero, the series is convergent for |a;| < r and 
divergent for | a; | > r. Our test tells us nothing, however, 
as to whether the series is convergent for \x\ = r^ that is, 
when x = Â±r. 

Corollary. If a 'power series is convergent for x = k, it 
is also (ionvergent for every value of x for ivliicli \x\ < | A: |.

293. Equality of two-power series. The following theorem, 
which is really an extension of Theorem F of Art. 126 has 
many important applications. 

Let each of the two-power iSeries 

a(^+ a-^x + a^x^ + â– â– â–  + aâ€ž2:" + â€¢â€¢â€¢ 
and 

be convergent for some values of x which are different from zero. 
If the sums of the two series are equal to each other for all 
of those values of x which make both series convergenU the 
coefficients of like powers of x in the two series must be equal, 
that is 

Aq = Jq, aj = 5^, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢, aâ€ž = b^. 

A rigorous proof of this theorem would require a rather 
long chain of preliminary theorems. We therefore content 
ourselves with a statement of the theorem witliout giving 
a proof. 

294. Expansion of functions as power series. We know 
from the theory of geometric progressions that the equation 

(1) l + :, + :^:2+^+ ... = 1_ 

1 â€” X 



Art. 205] EXPANSION OF RATIONAL Fl'NCTIONS 489 

holds for all values of x for which 1 2; | < 1. We may ex- 
press this by saying that the function 

(2) .-^ 

\ â€” X 

has been expanded into a power series, namely, 

(3) l4.:^+^:2_^^.3+ .... 

It is important to note that our proof of equation (1) assures 
us that its two members are equal to each other for all of 
those values of x for which \x\ < 1, but not for any other 
values of x. In fact the two members of equation (1) are 
not equal to each other for 2; = 2. F'or tlie left member 
becomes infinite when 2;= 2, while the right member is equal 
to â€” 1 when a; = 2. 

We may generalize these notions as follows. When a 
function f{x) is given, it is frequently possible to find a 
certain power series which is equal to fix') for those values 
of x for which the power series is convergent. In such 
cases we say that tlie function has been expanded as a poiver 
series. Tlie equivalence between the given function and the 
power series can never hold for values of x for which the power 
series does not converge. 

295. Expansion of rational functions. We may use the 

theorem of Art. 293 to obtain the expansion of a rational 
function, whenever such an expansion exists, by the method 
of undetermined coefficients. (See Art. 14:2.) The follow- 
ing examples will help to explain this method. 

1 â€” X â€¢ 
Example 1. Expand into a power series. 

1 + x'^ 

Sdlulinu. It' such a power series exists, let us denote its coefficients 
(as yet unknown) lÂ»y a^, ui, a.^, and so on, so that 

1 â€” X 

(1) ^ = Â«o + ^1-^ + "2-^" + "3-^^ + ^^4^ + â€¢â– â€¢â€¢ 

If this equation is true for all values of x for which the series is con- 
vergent, the following equation, obtained from (1) by clearing of frac- 
tions, must also hold for all such values of x; 



490 INFINITE SERIES [Art. 295 

\ â€” X = Gq + a^x + a^x'^ + a^x'^ + a^x* + â€¢â€¢â€¢ 
+ aQX- + a-^x^ + rioX-* + â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ 
In other words, we must have 

(2) 1 - X = Qq + rtjx + (Â«(, + rtj)^- + (Â«! + f/3)x3+ (oj + a^)x* + â€¢â– â€¢ 

for all values of x which make the series in the right member convergent. 
According to the theorem of Art. 293, this can be so only if the coeffi- 
cients of like powers in the two members of (2) are equal to each other. 
Consequently we conclude that (2) can be true only if 

1 = Â«oÂ» â€” 1 = "d = Â«o + Â«2' = rtj + Â«3, = 02 + 04, â€¢â€¢â€¢, 
whence 

Oq = 1, Â«j = - 1, flj = - Â«0 = - 1' "3 = - "i = + 1, O4 = - ^2 = + 1Â» â€” â€¢ 

Consequently we have 

(3) i^^ = 1- x-x2 + x3+ .r* , 

^ 1 + x^ 

if there exists a power series at all for (1 â€” .r)/l + x". 

In this particular example it is not very difficult to find the law of the 
coefficients, to prove that the series converges for ! .r| < 1 and to prove 
that equation (3) is actually true for all such values of x. However, 
that is a matter with which we are not primarily concerned just now. 

Example 2. Expand '- into a power series. 

x(x â€” 1) 

Solution. Let us try to use the same method as in Ex. 1 by putting 

3 

(4) â€” â€” = Qo + Â«i^ + "2^^ + â€¢â– â– ' 

x(x â€” 1) 

whence, clearing of fractions, 

3 = â€” UqX â€” Â«j.rj â€” aox"' â€¢â€¢â€¢ 

+ (loX- + Oj.r^ + â€¢â€¢â€¢. 

Equating coefficients of like powers we at once strike a contradiction, 
namely, 3 = 0. Therefore such an expansion is impossible in this case. 

The reason for this impossibility is very clear from (4). The function 
S/x(x â€” 1) has X = as a pole (see Art. 139) and therefore becomes 
infinite when x approaches zero as a limit. But the right member of (4) 
remains finite for x = 0, since it reduces to Qq. Therefore it is clear by 
inspection that an expansion of the form (4) is impossible. 

We may, however, write 

3 ^3 1 
x(x â€” 1) X X â€” 1 



Art. 295] EXPANSION OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS 491 

and expand the second fraction. We find 
1

so that 



â€” \ â€” X â€” X- â€” x^ 



^ = _ ? _ .3 - .3 X - 3 x2 - 3 x8 - â€¢â€¢ 



x(x-l)- 

This is not an ordinary power series expansion on account of the term 
â€” 3/x which occurs in it. This term may be written â€” 3 x"^. It in- 
volves a negative power of x as factor. 

These examples will suffice to justify the following gen- 
eral statement. But we shall not attempt to give a formal 
proof of its correctness. 

If a fractional rational function of x does not have x = as 
a pole, it may he expanded into a power series of the form 
a^ -f a^x + a^x^ + â€¢â€¢â–  

which will converge for some non-vanishing values of x, but not 
for all finite values of x. The coefficients of this series may be 
obtained by the method of undetermined coefficients. 

If a; = is a pole of the rational function, no such poioer 
series exists, but the function may be expressed as the sum of 
such a power series and certain additional terms, each of these 
terms having a negative power of x as factor. 

The following remark is of importance, if it be desired to 
obtain the general law according to which the coef'licieuts of 
the expansion are formed, so as to be able to judge of the 
convergence of the resulting series. 

In order to be able to recognize the general laiv of the co- 
efficients in the expansion of a rational function, it is advisable 
to express the function as a sum of simple partial fractions 
(^see Arts. 142-144) ayid then to expand the several partial 
fractions separately . 

EXERCISE CXXXVIII 
Expand the following rational functions in powers of x. Compute at 
least four terms of the expansion, find the general term whenever you 
can, and then determine the values of x for which the resulting series are 
convergent :

whenever n is a positive integer. In that case the right 
member of (1) contains w + 1 terms. 

If n is a negative number or a fraction, we may still form 
a series like the one which occurs in the right member of 
(1), but in all such cases this series will contain an infinite 
number of terms. It is easy to show that this series will 
be convergent for |a;j< 1 by applying the ratio test. (Art. 
286.) 

We have in fact

Thus, the quantity denoted by r in Art. 292 is equal to 1, 
and we conclude from the principal theorem of Art. 292 that 
the series is convergent for all values of x for which | a-j < 1. 
Thus, whenever |a:| < 1 the right member of (1) is a con- 
vergent series and therefore has a definite meaning. The 
left member of (1) also has a definite meaning. (See Arts. 
156 and 157.) In the particular case when w is a i)Ositive 
integer the two members are equal, as we have actually 
proved. We now state without proof, that the two members 
of (1) are equal (for \x\ < 1) for all values of n. This gives 
us the general binomial theorem.

In Exercise CXXXVIII, Example 2, Exercise CXXXIX, Example 4,

sions for -^ = (1 + x)-\ Vl + x = (1 + x)i v^rrr = (l + x)i The

student should verify that the expansions obtained by him for these 
functions are in agreement with the results which would be obtained 
by using formula (1). This may be regarded as a partial proof of (1). 
A complete proof may be found in Dickson's College Algebra, Chapter 
XV, according to a method due to Euler. The most convenient proof, 
however, depends upon methods developed in the calculus. 

Formula (1) may also be used to compute (a + by. For 
we may write 

a-\-b = a(l-{--

(2) Qa + by=aÂ«(l+^y. 

The second factor may be expanded as a power series in 
X = b/a by means of (1) if 1 5 1 < | a |. If instead 1 6 1 > | a |, we 
write 



(a + by = b"(l + ^Y 



and put x= a/b. 

This method is very convenient for computing square 
roots, cube roots, nth roots of numbers.

where \oge(l + x) means the natural logarithm of \ + x. 
This series is convergent for |2;| < 1, as the student may 
verify by using the ratio test. (See Ex. 5, Exercise 
CXXXVII.) 

Theoretically (1) may be used to calculate the natural logarithm of 
a number 1 + x whenever | x | < 1. But actually the difficulty arises that 
the series (1) converges very slowly, so that a very large number of terms 
would be required in order to obtain a fairly accurate result. 

It is easy, however, to find a more convenient formula for the calcula- 
tion of natural logarithms. From (1) we obtain 

(2) log,(l-x) = -x-f-^-5^- .... lxl<l.
