        many of the Love they owe to every living creature.

INTRODUCTION


The arranging of this help for those who are seeking to obey the call
to a higher humanitarianism, which is put forth by non-flesh-eating
men and women, has been a labour of love: the labour, the result of
an earnest endeavour to so write the receipts that "the way-faring
woman may not err therein," the love, of a kind whose integrity
may not be questioned, since it has inspired to the never easy task
of going against the stream of habit and custom, and to individual
effort in behalf of the myriads of gentle and amenable creatures,
which an animality that defiles the use of the word has accustomed
man to killing and eating.

The name Vegetarian has come to mean one who abstains from animal
flesh as food; and, as some designation is necessary, it is perhaps
a sufficiently suitable one. This term did not, however, originally
classify those who used a bloodless diet, but is derived from the
Latin Homo Vegitus, which words described to the Romans a strong,
vigorous man. The definition of the word Vegitus, as given in
Thomas Holyoke's Latin Dictionary, is "whole, sound, quick, fresh,
lively, lusty, gallant, trim, brave," and of Vegito, "to refresh,
to re-create." Professor Mayor of England adds to these definitions:
"The word vegetarian belongs to an illustrious family; vegetable,
which has been called its mother, is really its niece."

The word has unfortunately become intermingled with various dietetic
theories, but the Vegetarian who is one because his conscience
for one reason or another condemns the eating of flesh, occupies a
very different place in the world of ethics from one who is simply
refraining from meat eating in an effort to cure bodily ills.

Indeed, the dyspeptic frequenting the usual Vegetarian restaurant
has little opportunity to know much about vegetables as food,
the menu being, as a rule, so crowded with various mixtures which
are supposedly "meat substitutes" that vegetables pure and simple
find small place. This book contains no meat substitutes, as such,
but receipts for the palatable preparation of what is called by many
"live foods,"--that is, food which has no blood to shed and does not,
therefore, become dead before it can be eaten.

There will also be found lacking from the index such dishes as
"Vegetarian Hamburg Steak," "Pigeon Pie, Vegetarian style," etc.,
which should repel rather than attract, by bringing to mind what
Bernard Shaw has graphically spoken of as "scorched carcasses."

It has been proven by myself and my household that flesh eating may
be safely stopped in one day with no injury to health or strength,
and that a table supplied from the receipts in this book can make
those whom it furnishes with food well and strong as far as food can
make them so.

There are many reasons why thoughtful, cleanly, humane people should
not feed upon animals, but there is a surprising deafness to this
fact shown by the majority of those active in humane charities. One
marvels to see hundreds of consecrated workers in session, putting
forth every effort for the enacting of laws for the amelioration of the
sufferings of cattle travelling to slaughter by car and ship, who are
still content to patronise the butcher shop to buy food supplied by
the dead bodies of these tortured victims of a false appetite. Mere
thoughtlessness can make the kindest act cruelly inconsistent, for
I once saw a woman presiding at a meeting held to discountenance the
wearing of aigrettes with a sheaf of them decorating her bonnet. This
looks much like receiving stolen goods while denouncing theft.

It is well to write, and legislate, and pray for better and kinder
treatment of these frightened, thirst-maddened, tortured creatures
on their journey to our tables, but the surest, quickest way to help
(and this can be done even while continuing to work for the alleviation
of their sufferings) is to stop feeding upon them.

In a recent issue of a paper devoted to humane matters there is an
indignant protest against the sufferings endured by crated chickens
in a certain market, and another article deplores the cruelty shown
to turtles in the same place, but when we know the writers of these
protests to be still willing to use these creatures on their tables,
it is not always easy to fully credit their tender-heartedness. In
another such paper there appear from year to year sentimental pictures
and poems extolling the kindliness and virtues of "the cattle upon
a thousand hills," while those same pages print instructions on the
most humane way of slaying them, giving as a reason for the sudden
and painless death described that suffering "poisons the meat."

The favourite phrase, "our four-footed friends," seems rather an
anachronism in the face of our acknowledged relations to them as eater
and eaten, for the phrase indicates a mutual pact of friendship,
which, however well sustained by them, is dishonoured by man; for
even cannibals, we are told, sink no lower than to eat their foes.

The demand for butcher's meat may not seem materially lessened because
I do not eat it, but it is lessened notwithstanding, and I rejoice to
know that in the past seven years my abstinence from flesh must have
resulted in a little less slaughter, and I am glad to have reduced
by even one drop the depth of that ocean of blood. I have heard the
Biblical statement that man was to have dominion over all the earth
quoted as a justification for the eating of the lower animals. We
will some day be so civilised that we will recognise the great truth
that dominion implies care, and guardianship, and protection rather
than the right to destroy.

The first objection voiced against Vegetarianism is not usually
against its principle, but its practice; we are told that the refusal
to eat meat causes inconvenience, and that it is best to "eat what is
set before you, asking no questions for conscience's sake." I could
respect the position of one who literally believed and consistently
acted on this mandate, but where in Christendom can he be found? Few
of us could or would eat the flesh of a pet lamb, or partake knowingly
of horse flesh, or could or would feel called upon to dine on these
lines with the peoples who eat dog, or with so-called cannibals. The
host might have secured, in a broad spirit of hospitality, just the
particular carcass which most pleased his own palate, but courtesy
seldom forces us to eat any flesh other than the sorts to which our
own habits have accustomed us.

There is a well-known story of an American statesman who was reared
by Vegetarian parents in the country, and taken while still a small
boy to dine at a neighbour's. During the progress of the meal a large
platter was borne into the room, on which lay something the like of
which he had not seen on any table. He stared in wonder, and finally
located the resemblance and shouted, "Why, mother, if that isn't a
dead hen!" Habit had not overcome his horror of that particular dead
thing as food, as it would have done had he seen dead hens served as
food all his life.

As to the inconvenience caused my friends when I am at their tables,
I consider it of such small consequence compared to the fact that
even one child should be standing almost knee-deep in blood in some
slaughter-house, working to supply my wants, that it is not worth a
second thought. No one need go hungry from any well-planned dinner,
even though no extra preparation has been made for the non-meat-eating
guest; but if my hostess knows in advance that I do not eat meat,
and wishes to have prepared an especial dish, I give her the benefit
of the doubt, and believe that she is as pleased to do it as I would
be in her place. We like to take a little extra trouble to entertain
our friends, and the thought expended to give others pleasure is
perhaps the real joy of hospitality.

Another class of objector likes to remind us that we take life when we
eat vegetables, or drink, or breathe. A friend, who has since ceased
to consider the unnecessary and cruel slaughtering of thousands of
creatures daily a fit subject for joking, once sent me in raillery a
sonnet which rehearsed the sad death suffered by a cabbage to satisfy
a Vegetarian's selfish cravings. I find no qualms in my own conscience
on this subject, but should I ever come to feel as these over-sensitive
claim I should, I hope I will not then eat even the "innocent cabbage."

Again, if the germs in the water we drink and the air we breathe
do die by reason of our drinking and breathing I endure no
self-condemnation. Man cannot be required to do the impossible by
any Principle of Good, and to do each day what good he is able to do,
to avoid the evil he can avoid, and in every difficulty choose what
he thinks to be the lesser of two evils, is perhaps as much as even
Divine Love expects of him to-day.

It is well to face the unpleasant fact that there are occasions when
in our present state of development it seems necessary to kill in
self-defence, as it were, moths, rats, etc.; but even in this we can
"do our best," and it has been well said, "angels can do no more." We
can by care in our households greatly reduce this necessity, and we
can always see that no creatures, although destroying our property,
pilfering or stealing, are in their death made to suffer. In this
connection I would urge every one who reads these lines to never
permit a piece of sticky fly-paper to be brought into the house,
for of all cruel ways of destruction, this slow method, by which the
unfortunate fly almost dismembers itself in its frantic efforts to
escape, is one of the most fiendishly contrived.

An advocate of Vegetarianism has truly said, "A vegetable diet is
as little connected with weakness and cowardice as meat eating
is with physical force and courage." That Vegetarians are not
physical weaklings is no mere matter of opinion, but is proven
by the giant Japanese wrestlers; the ancient Greek wrestlers;
those Indian regiments of the British army showing most endurance;
by the peasantry of the world, which is seldom able to afford meat,
and above all, by those famous Vegetarians who march around the globe
doing the work carnivorous man is too weak to do,--the horse, the ox,
the camel, and the elephant. One of our best-known cooking teachers and
food experts printed this statement not long ago: "While meat seems
necessary to the rapid development of the American, I must contend
that a well-selected vegetable diet will give greater health, bodily
vigour, and mental strength," which would seem contradictory, for even
an American would not seem to require other food than that which will
give him greatest health, bodily vigour, and mental strength.

Nor have we cause to feel ashamed of the mentality of the guests at
Ceres' table, which is graced by a goodly company; the list of names
encircling the cover of "The Vegetarian Magazine" reads, "Adam, Hesiod,
Gautama, Isaiah, Daniel, Plato, Zoroaster, Aristotle, Seneca, Ovid,
Plutarch, Pope, Swedenborg, Leonardo da Vinci, Voltaire, Franklin,
Westley, Linnæus, Shelley, Tolstoi, and King Oscar II." Others are
Bernard Shaw, and Maurice Maeterlinck (who is said to have become a
non-meat eater to gain greater endurance for his favourite pastime
of mountain climbing), Richard Wagner, and General Booth.

But after all, the one great argument for a fleshless diet is the
humanitarian one, and it does not seem possible that persons exist
to-day who do not know of the horrors of cruelty which take place
hourly, in order that meat may be eaten by men and women who could
not look without sickening at the process which has made possible
the roast upon their tables, but who are nevertheless the employers
of every fainting child in the stock-yards, and every brutalised man
in the shambles, whose wages they pay with every pound of meat they
buy. The real butcher of an animal is the one for whom it receives
its death blow, not the one who actually deals that blow.

A man who recently visited some stock-yards writes: "We were sorry to
see the Thor man make mislicks at a pretty heifer. His first stroke
did not fell her, and she staggered and looked at him so wonderingly
and pathetically. He could not strike her while her head was in that
position, and after giving her two or three more ineffectual blows,
she looked at him so reproachfully, as if pleading, 'Why do you treat
me so cruelly?  What have I ever done to you?' Finally he got her
down and out of her misery. I shall never take a bit of steak on my
fork without seeing that pretty heifer lifting her stunned head to
that awkward pounder."

Perhaps nothing more revolting than this same writer's remarks anent
pig-killing has been written, but since the words are accurately
true, they should be fit to read, for if the words which tell the
truth about meat as food are unfit for our ears, the meat itself is
not fit for our mouths. He describes the pig-sticking, the skinning,
and the process which makes the pig into pork, and then adds: "He goes
into the cooling room, and the whole effort from that time is to keep
him from crumbling back into dust, attacked by worms. Salt and brine
and smoke and cold prevent the corpse from utter dissolution. The
refrigerator is a sort of Purgatory where the brute stays until he
finally finds a cemetery in the human alimentary canal." Yet this
man expects to again have meat "on his fork"!

The "Cosmopolitan" calls attention to the remarkable procession daily
passing through a certain slaughter-house, as follows: "Imagine a
procession of 10,000 cattle marching two by two, in a line fifteen
miles long; let 20,000 sheep follow them, bleating along twelve miles
of road; after them drive sixteen miles of hogs, 27,000 strong; then
let 30,000 fowls bring up the rear, clucking and quacking and gobbling,
over a space of six miles; and in this whole caravan, stretching for
nearly fifty miles and requiring two days to pass a given point, you
will see the animals devoted to death in the packing houses of ----
& Co. in a single day. Surely a Buddhist would think that the head
of that establishment had much to answer for. Never before in the
world's history was a massacre of the innocents organised on such a
stupendous scale or with such scientific system."

People are surprisingly callous to the sufferings of those animals
destined to become food. Recently some well-dressed, well-mannered
men were on a train returning East from a Western visit, and the train
coming to a standstill for some reason, their conversation was plainly
overheard by their fellow-passengers. They were discussing a visit
to the stock-yards, and one of them, quite convulsed with laughter,
cried out that he really thought the most comical sight he had seen
while away, in fact one of the funniest things he had seen in his
whole life, was the antics of a pig "which had escaped out of the
scalding pen!" The pig-sticker had evidently been as awkward that
time as the man who missed the pretty heifer.

It is daily less possible to buy turkeys and chickens minus their
heads. The delicate death without the use of the old-time axe (which
we degraded men and women have thought a pretty symbol to place on
Thanksgiving Day table cards) is brought about by hanging the fowls
up by the feet, in what fright can be imagined, an incision is then
made in the roof of the mouth, and after bleeding to death, which,
as in the case of calves or veal, insures solid white flesh, they are
served as food to dainty women who can scarcely bear to kill a fly,
and alas! to some members of the societies for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals!

One crate of chickens can encase more suffering than I want endured
for me. There is first the terror in capture, then the suffering of
being thrust, legs often tied, in the small over-crowded crate, then
the journey in the shrieking train, and the thirst-tortured hours in
the sun before the final twist of the neck or the blow of the axe,
given in many cases just before natural death would render the fowl
unfit for sale. And such food, poisoned by fear and suffering, is
considered the most delicate, and thought fit to feed to invalids!

That all chickens do not endure the same suffering before death is
no excuse for eating them, for some will have to submit to it while
chicken is an article of food. The modern invention of fattening fowl
by the machine-stuffing method, to make what are called in England
"Surrey fowls," and in America are given various fancy names, is so
revolting that it almost makes one faint to read a true account of
it. We are selfishly prone to comfort ourselves when these things are
brought to our notice with the thought that the lower creatures do not
suffer as we would. The fact is that no two live beings suffer the
same in any event, physical or mental, but the lower animal or bird
or fish suffers in its fear and death all it is capable of suffering,
and we have no right to make any creature do this for our pleasure.

Mr. E. Bell has written, "Dreadful are the revelations made by humane
men, who, setting aside personal comfort and peace of mind, have
endeavoured to sound the depths of animal agony and bloodshed. The
process of flaying alive, and even of dismembering animals before
the breath has left their bodies, is far from uncommon in private
slaughter-houses."

When we witness the cruelty to horses on our streets, though they
are property which the most unwise would naturally seek to care for,
we can only imagine what must chance to the unfortunate creatures,
already condemned to death and only regarded as food, at the hands
of the hardened men whose miserable lot it is to be employed by
Christendom to do its most evil work.

In a pamphlet called "An Epitome of Vegetarianism" C. P. Newcombe
writes: "Our opponents are quick to point out the supposed resemblance
between the canine teeth of man and those of the carnivora, forgetting
that they are even more prominent in the ape, the horse, and the
camel. We accept the challenge and appeal for an authoritative
statement of the facts to the great masters of science, among whom
there is complete agreement, viz., that expressed by Baron Cuvier, the
Professor of Natural History in the College of France, who wrote in
'The Animal Kingdom,' vol. i, page 88: 'Fruits, roots, and the other
succulent parts of vegetables appear to be the natural food of man;
his hands afford him a facility for gathering them, and his short and
comparatively weak jaws, his short canine teeth, not passing beyond the
common line of others, and his tuberculous cheek teeth would not permit
him either to feed upon herbage or devour flesh unless these aliments
were previously prepared by the culinary process.' Similar opinions
are expressed by Sir Charles Bell, F. R. S., Prof. William Lawrence,
F. R. S., Sir Richard Owen, K. C. B., F. R. S., and Dr. Charles Darwin,
with many others."

While interesting in stating a case, this interests me as an argument
but little, for if we were carnivorously made, with our minds,
our hearts, our capacity for love and charity, and that great hope
we have of finally manifesting the perfection of the sons of God,
we still should control our tendencies by a higher law, and no more
be carnivorous than we are apes, or marauders, or any other mental
or physical manifestation from which spiritual evolution has lifted
us high.

But this humanitarianism does not consider alone the animals
slaughtered, but the men, women, and children who do this revolting
work. One packing-house in the West advertises over 18,000 employees;
multiply this by thousands and one can estimate the numbers of human
beings who are thus degraded and brutalised. In my own household
I have made it a point of honour to demand no labour which I would
not be willing to do myself; I might fail in strength, but morally I
would be willing to undertake any work required by me, and from the
day I realised what I required from others if I ate meat, I became
an abstainer from it, for no surer ethical truth can be stated than
that we have no moral right to demand from the hands of another,
work we would not be willing to undertake ourselves.

Mr. Henry Salt has written, "Of all recognised occupations, the
work which is looked upon with the greatest loathing (next to
the hangman's) is that of the butcher--the trade of doing to death
countless numbers of inoffensive and highly organised creatures, amid
scenes of indescribable filth and ferocity--is delegated to a pariah
class of slaughter-men, who are thus themselves made the victims of
a grievous social wrong."

So large a percentage of the murderers of to-day have been butchers,
they or their fathers before them, that these statistics alone
constitute a sufficient argument for Vegetarianism.

Man's inhumanity to himself in this matter of flesh eating is rapidly
being uncovered by meat inspectors, food experts, and hundreds of
physicians the world over. The statistics comparing meat-eating
and non-meat-eating races with regard to tuberculosis, cancer,
appendicitis, etc., are of the greatest interest to those who care
not only for the health but for the mere cleanness of their bodies.

Dr. B. W. Richardson, in a book called "The Field of Disease," says:
"In Jewish communities there are a number of men set apart to act
as inspectors of animal food. They attend at the slaughter-houses,
and after an animal is slain and dressed they submit it to inspection;
then, unless they put upon it their sign, that it is free from disease,
it is not permitted to enter a Jewish family. It enters into the
families outside the Jewish community, so that we who are not Jews
actually accept into our bodies food which the Jews have rejected
as diseased."

The statistics taken from two small abattoirs alone, for one year, as
given by a secretary of one Jewish ecclesiastical board are as follows:


                  Total oxen killed        22,308
                  Diseased                  7,885
                  Total calves killed       3,330
                  Diseased                    705
                  Total sheep killed       41,556
                  Diseased                 13,019


According to this very nearly one-third of all the meat sold to
Christian families is tainted by parasitical disease. If an animal
dies of cancer, tuberculosis, etc., our laws protect us from the
carcass, but, if slaughtered, the diseased portion is cut away and
the remainder is sold as fit for food. Such blood is squeezed from
beef and poured by the gallon by loving hands into the willing lips
of consumptives and anæmics!

The true Vegetarian will not be seen adorned (?) by any of the
reapings from a dead body, whether they be feathers or furs, for
these have no beauty in the sight of those who see them in thought,
dripping with the blood from which they can never be truly cleansed.

Those who would "strain at gnats" while swallowing camels, criticise
the Vegetarian for his kid gloves and his leather shoes; but perfect
conditions do not yet prevail for the absolutely consistent carrying
out of his principles; his effort is to help to bring these to pass,
and he does not refrain from beginning for the reason that he cannot
yet do all. An adequate substitute for leather has been made which
experiments have proven of value, but, as yet, there is no demand
which justifies its manufacture.

Many express the fear that, were wholesale slaughter abolished, the
earth would be overrun by the lower animals; but were artificial and
unnatural breeding discontinued we can safely trust that the animal
creation would find its proper place in the world, as everything does,
under the guidance of the controlling Mind which is Creator.

Stop and think for a moment what the world would be like to-day if it
were Vegetarian. If the world were Vegetarian, the endless caravans of
doomed creatures would not be ambling to the shambles; not a man would
be brutalised by the daily slaughter of hundreds of gentle creatures;
not a woman would be engaged in sorting edible parts from the dissected
carcasses, making all red around her; not a child would be standing
deep in offal, seeking useful bits of dead bodies; "where sympathy is,
cruelty is impossible," therefore, not a dog would be maltreated, not a
cat selfishly deserted to starve, not a horse cruelly beaten, and not
a vivisectionist could be found on the face of the earth! Those who
had learned to be just to the lower animals would not fail in their
duties to man, and in this millennium, prophesied in Isaiah xi: 9,
slaughter-houses, transport cars, and cattle-ships would be empty,
and the fields and meadows would be filled with labourers under the
clear sky, tilling the ground to provide the food of man.

        I do not see how it is possible that so many good people
        remain meat-eaters.

THE KITCHEN


There is no room in the house which requires such careful furnishing
as the kitchen, and much time may be saved there if the right thing is
in the right place, for just as truly as "the means to do ill deeds
make ill deeds done," do the means to do things well tend toward
their being done.

To house-builders I would urge that it pays to have a white enamelled
sink, and to insist that no sand-soap or scouring soap be used
on it, as this removes the finish and makes it less easy to keep
it spotless. See that a package of one of the cleaning powders is
placed near the sink, convenient for use the first time the maid
looks about for materials, and over the sink on small hooks have hung
two or three different shaped sink brushes. An enamelled soap-dish
should be fastened above the sink, and on the left of it a grooved,
slightly slanting draining board for washed dishes; hanging under
this on a large hook should be the enamelled dishpan and back of it
a wire drainer, both hanging free from the wall.

Any kitchen can have a chair-rail put around it, and this four-inch
wide board should be arranged with small hooks placed at a distance of
ten or twelve inches apart, and on these should hang the enamelled
spoons, strainers, egg-beater, small jugs, and the saucepans,
the bottoms of these being always in evidence and not out of sight
in cupboards. The Europeans have always had their cooking utensils
displayed as a part of the kitchen furnishing, and when this is done
there is less temptation to neglect their absolute cleanliness.

One of the comforts of my kitchen is a holder for saucepan covers; I
was about to invent such a holder when I found that the wire ones made
to display half a dozen handsome plates were perfectly suitable. One
of these hangs beside the stove and the covers are conveniently at
hand when required.

A cupboard built in the kitchen, sixteen inches deep and six feet
across, will hold all the casseroles, baking-pans, tins for spices,
etc., which the usual family requires. Mine was built with this
conviction, and if it becomes overcrowded, I know it has things in
it which do not belong there, and a few moments given to overseeing
its rearrangement always leave it with all the space required.

The table shown in the illustration is becoming well-known in American
kitchens; the deep drawers for flour, etc., are a convenience not
easy to estimate, but the fact that two sizes of pastry boards slide
snugly into their places under the top is its best feature.

A ball of string in a holder hung up with small scissors attached,
a neat calendar, a washable tablet for orders, a burnt-match holder,
a match-box holder fastened near the stove, a small mirror on a door
or in an inconspicuous corner, and a wall clock are things which I
advise the young housekeeper to see securely placed in her kitchen
before the pictures are hung in the drawing-room.

A plate-rack is not only always quaint and decorative, but is
most useful and labour-saving. A pestle and mortar should be among
the utensils of every kitchen, as well as a vegetable mill, and a
small hard-wood board, used exclusively for the cutting of fruit,
vegetables, etc., which are to be sliced, saves many a cut finger,
as the plate usually used is not the proper shape or texture for such
a slippery process.

A piece of thick glass measuring about 7×9 inches, and bound about
the edges with heavy gummed paper or linen, is useful to lay upon the
open pages of the cook-book, and serves the double purpose of holding
it open at the required page and of protecting it from floured or
buttered fingers.

A plentiful supply of the small earthenware dishes, called casseroles,
marmites, ramekins, and gratin dishes, is especially useful in the
Vegetarian's kitchen.

Those building homes should see that the place on which the stove is
to stand is covered with suitable tiling, and this should extend for
two feet or more around the stove. The floor itself is best covered
with linoleum, and if a colour scheme is carried out in this room,
as it may well be in these days of many-coloured enamelled ware,
it can be accented by the linoleum chosen and the kitchen thus made
as beautiful for its purpose as any room in the house.








      I have not partaken of a fellow creature for fifteen years.

THE DINING ROOM


If a breakfast room is not used, a small winged table set in a
sunny corner, or bay-window recess of the dining room, and used as a
breakfast table, is an improvement upon breakfast at the large dining
table, and can be arranged in almost any dining room.

If pictures are hung in this room nothing less appropriate
than those usually chosen as fit subjects for its walls can be
imagined. Engravings showing the gentle deer hunted to his death, with
the dog's fangs already buried in his flesh, stuffed heads of the same
animal, and paintings of dead fish, ducks or grouse, hanging by their
feet, should not give pleasure to or improve the appetites of humane
people. If pictures are used let us have those which depict life,
joy, kindness, and beauty rather than cruelty, bloodshed, and death.








            Among the noblest in the land,
              Though he may count himself the least,
            That man I honor and revere
              Who without favor, without fear,
            In the great city dares to stand
              The friend of every friendless beast.

SUGGESTIVE COMMENTS


SEASONING

The subject of seasoning is indeed holy ground in culinary matters,
and after much thought and experiment I have decided that the phrase
so deplored by young housekeepers, "season to taste," is after all not
the worst one to use. No such inaccurate directions were to appear
in this cook-book when planned, but I have finally decided with the
army of wiser cooks who have preceded me that accurate measurements
in seasoning are dangerous to success. Not only do tastes vary,
but much depends on the time the seasoning is added, on the rapidity
with which the food is cooking, etc. With this in mind, and very long
prejudice against the old phrase above mentioned, I have compromised
and frequently been tempted to state quantities of salt and pepper,
usually regretting when I have. The truth is, unless one can "season
to taste" one cannot cook palatable dishes, and my final word on the
subject is that it is well to always use a little more salt and pepper
than seems advisable, and then just before serving add a little more!




MEASURING

Weights as a means of measuring quantities have been avoided in these
recipes, as I can see no advantage to the system which uses them,
and I have been able to show even English cooks that the scales are
not the most necessary part of the kitchen furnishing, and they have
become devoted to our simple method of using the kitchen cup as the
standard. It holds 1/2 pint, and 2 cups, therefore, hold 1 pint;
4 cups hold 1 quart; and I find no fault with the old couplet,--


                       "A pint's a pound
                        The world around."


It usually is, and one cannot go far wrong in acting as if it always
were.




THICKENING

In thickening sauces and soups, ordinary flour can always be used
and cornstarch also, and as a rule I have said "flour" only in these
recipes, but have only refrained from always advising potato-flour
because it would have confused many who cannot obtain it in America. In
Germany it is always used, and when it can be had is far nicer for
thickening all vegetable sauces and soups than any other sort of flour.




AN HERB GARDEN

No one thing pays better for the little trouble expended than a
small herb garden. Buy two or three tarragon plants, cover them in
the winter, and in the autumn pick the leaves to make vinegar and to
dry. Plant chervil, parsley, thyme, chives, and a plant of rosemary.

A window-box will keep parsley and chives on hand, and a clump of
chives from the market will grow for weeks if set in a bowl and
watered occasionally.




GELATINE

Instead of the usual gelatine use must be made of arrowroot or a
gelatine advertised to be purely vegetable. One tablespoon is usually
allowed to 1 pint of liquid, but experiments must be made and there
will usually be directions found with the package.




FAT FOR FRYING

The Vegetarian can well afford to do away with that doubtful economy,
cooking butter. For ordinary frying use good butter; for deep fat
use a good brand of cooking-oil, or cocoanut butter.




CANNED GOODS

It seems to be a habit with many people to decry the use of canned
vegetables, although I believe there are few households which
subsist without them. My experience is that the best grades of canned
vegetables are often far sweeter and better, fresher in fact, than
vegetables that can be bought in city markets. The housekeeper should
make it a point to know which brands she prefers and to trade where she
can get them; and where no retailer carries them she can usually obtain
cases containing two dozen each from the preservers themselves. A
little trouble taken in the autumn to stock the store-room, instead
of ordering "a can of peas" now and then at random, saves time and
trouble in the end. Among the canned vegetables which are put up and
sealed the day they are picked by the best firms are beets, peas,
corn, spinach, hard-shelled beans, tomatoes, stringless beans, wax
beans, mushrooms, pimentos, okra, okra-tomato, asparagus, etc.; and
the saving of time and labour in the preparation of beans, spinach,
and beets especially, is worth consideration. People make the mistake
of merely warming up canned goods and then serving them, whereas when
the can is opened the vegetables are only ready to be seasoned and
finished as they would be had they been boiled at home. Good canned
vegetables are not easy to improve upon, and I serve them constantly
to people who will not easily credit my statement that they are not
so-called "fresh" vegetables.








        I will not kill or hurt any living creature needlessly,
        nor destroy any beautiful thing, but will strive to save
        and comfort all gentle life and guard and perfect all
        natural beauty upon the earth.

                                                            John Ruskin.








SOUPS


Most clear soups can be greatly improved in colour by using a small
quantity of vegetable soup browning, or caramel. Do not overdo it,
however, as the flavour is not pleasant when too pronounced. All
cream soups should be cooked in a double boiler.




VEGETABLE STOCK

Few meat stocks have of themselves more flavour than vegetable stock,
that is, the water in which vegetables have cooked. The water in
which rice, onions, leeks, celery, beans, cabbage, etc., have boiled
is valuable in Vegetarian cookery, and the wise cook will use it in
many ways to enhance the flavours of soups and sauces.




A SIMPLE CONSOMMÉ OR STOCK

A simple way of preparing a rich, clear consommé is to wash well 1/2
cup of German lentils, drain them and toss them for ten minutes in a
saucepan in which 1 tablespoon of butter has been melted. Then pour
on them 5 cups of cold water, set them over a hot fire, and let them
boil rapidly about half an hour only. Drain, and strain through a
fine cloth, and return to a clean saucepan with 1 bay leaf, 1 slice
of onion, 2 cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed; simmer slowly
for fifteen minutes, season with salt and pepper, and add a little
sherry if liked.

If the lentils are cooked longer, it will make a cloudy soup, which
will be stronger but not clear.




CLEAR BOUILLON OR CONSOMMÉ

There are various vegetable extracts in the market which, when diluted,
make delicious stock, or clear soup. If these are not available,
a clear vegetable broth may be made as follows:

Wash 3 cups of any dried beans or lentils, and put them to soak in
a covered earthenware dish with 10 cups of water for twelve hours or
so. Then empty with that same water into a kettle, and let come slowly
to the boiling point, skim frequently, and do not let it actually
boil. When clear, and there seems no further need of skimming, add 1
cup each of cut onions, carrots, turnips, 1 tablespoon of parsley,
1 tablespoon of salt, 1 clove of garlic, and 1 teaspoon of thyme,
etc., 1 tablespoon of celery seed, and 1 bay leaf.

Let boil up once, and then place on the back of the stove to barely
simmer for two hours; then strain through a fine sieve, and a good
broth is made. The beans, etc., can be utilised in a deep pie, or with
brown or white sauce in crust cups, in a curry, or many other ways.

To make this into a strong, clear soup put 2 tablespoons of butter
in a saucepan, and when melted add 1/2 cup each of chopped onions,
carrots, turnips, and celery, 2 cloves, and a bit of parsley; fry
until somewhat browned, then cover with 6 cups of the broth, and
let simmer very quietly for two hours. Skim often, drain, let cool,
remove any grease from the top, and to clarify add to it, when cold,
the slightly beaten yolk of 1 egg and the whites of 3, then set
over a hot fire and stir vigorously, watching for the first sign
of boiling. At this, remove to a place where it cannot even simmer,
but will be warm for half an hour, and strain through a fine, clean
cloth. A wineglass of sherry may be added if to be served in cups.




CREAM OF ARTICHOKE

Scrape and slice enough Jerusalem artichokes to make 2 cups, and cover
them with cold water. Let them stand for fifteen or twenty minutes,
and put them in a saucepan with 2 quarts of cold water or milk, or
1 quart of each, and let them cook for an hour or until thoroughly
soft. Now rub them through a sieve with 2 cups of the stock in which
they cooked, and return to the fire. When boiling add 1 tablespoon of
butter and 1 of flour, rubbed together, and 1 teaspoon of salt and 1
saltspoon of pepper, and cook about ten minutes before adding 2 cups
of hot milk, or 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of cream. Stir well and let
boil up once before serving. A teaspoon of chopped parsley or chives
improves the appearance and taste of almost any cream soup.




CREAM OF ARTICHOKE WITH NASTURTIUMS

Make the plain cream of artichoke soup as in preceding recipe, and
add before straining 1 handful of nasturtium leaves and blossoms;
or, instead, add 1 tablespoon of these, finely minced, to the soup
before serving.




ASPARAGUS SOUP

Use 1 can of asparagus, cut off the tips, and lay them aside. Cut up
the stalks, cover with 4 cups of cold milk (or use half water and half
milk), and let cook slowly in a double boiler for half an hour; then
strain, pressing the asparagus well to extract the flavour. Return to
the saucepan, add 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of butter, into
which 1 teaspoon of flour has been made smooth, season generously
with salt and pepper, add the asparagus tips, 1 cup of milk, and,
just before serving, 1 tablespoon of whipped cream. A tablespoon of
minced onion fried for ten minutes in butter is sometimes added to
the stalks while cooking.




BARLEY AND TOMATO SOUP

Cook 1 can of tomatoes and 1 chopped Spanish onion together for
fifteen minutes, then rub through a wire sieve; add 3 tablespoons of
pearl barley, 1 tablespoon of butter, some pepper and salt, and cook
for one hour, until the barley is soft. Re-season before serving.




BLACK BEAN SOUP

Soak 2 cups of beans for twelve hours or more, and then drain them and
put into 8 cups of cold water; add 3 whole cloves, 3 whole allspice,
and 3 whole peppers, salt well and boil gently for two hours, rub
through sieve, and reheat. Mix 1 tablespoon of thickening flour, and
1 tablespoon of butter and water, and stir into the soup at boiling
point; season afresh and pour into a tureen in which are placed, neatly
sliced, 1 hard-boiled egg and half a dozen seeded slices of lemon. This
soup is improved by adding 1 wineglass of sherry, or one may substitute
for it a few drops of Tomato Chutney or Worcestershire sauce.




BELGIAN SOUP

Take 4 cups of diced turnips and put them in a saucepan with 2
tablespoons of butter, and stir for ten minutes over a slow fire;
then stir in 2 cups of water, 2 teaspoons of brown sugar, and plenty
of pepper and salt, and let simmer for another ten minutes; add
2 cups of milk thickened with 1 tablespoon of flour, let boil up,
stirring constantly, and serve with croutons.



PLAIN BEAN SOUP

Wash 2 cups of any sort of dried beans and soak twelve hours or more
in cold water. Before using, strain them and cover with 8 cups of
cold water. Put over the fire and let cook gently for four hours,
then rub them through a sieve into their own stock, season with 1
tablespoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and 1 tablespoon of
butter, and let them cook ten minutes longer. Serve with half-inch
squares of toast in the tureen.




BROWN BEAN SOUP

Take 1 cup of brown beans and 1/2 cup of German lentils, wash well
and put in a saucepan with plenty of cold water, 2 or 3 chopped
onions, 1 stalk of celery, 1 bay leaf, and simmer together for three
hours, then strain. If a thin soup is wanted, do not press any of
the pulp through the strainer, but if it is liked somewhat thick,
do so. Return the strained soup to the saucepan and thicken with
1 teaspoon of thickening flour. This is now delicious soup stock,
and can be served plain, or varied by adding peas, diced carrots,
spaghetti, a few drops of sauce, a little sherry, tomato catsup,
or curry powder. Season well with salt and pepper before serving.




RED BEAN SOUP

Soak for 8 hours or more 2 cups of red beans, then put them in a large
saucepan containing 8 cups of cold water, 1 cup of milk, and 2 onions
halved, each having 4 cloves stuck in it. Let cook for two hours, then
press through a sieve, reheat, adding just before serving 1 wineglass
of claret and fresh seasoning of salt and pepper. 1 hard-boiled egg
chopped fine is an improvement to this soup.




LIMA BEAN CREAM SOUP

Soak 2 cups of dried lima beans for several hours and then put them
in a saucepan with 1 cup of cold water and 1 cup of milk and let them
cook for two hours, adding salt when they have partly cooked. Put
1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion
chopped fine. Let cook slowly until browned, then scrape the contents
of the frying pan into the saucepan containing the beans, and add
1 tablespoon of tomato catsup or chutney and press all through
a sieve, and re-season before serving. If liked a little thick,
use 1 tablespoon of flour, made smooth in 1/2 cup of milk or cream,
to thicken. A tablespoon of whipped cream in the tureen is always an
improvement to a cream soup.




DUTCH CABBAGE SOUP

Make exactly like Cockie-Leekie soup, using the water in which a
cabbage has boiled for stock and adding 1/2 cup of finely chopped
cabbage instead of using any of the barley to return to the strained
soup. Those who like caraway seed will enjoy the addition of 1
teaspoon of these to the soup. If used, add them with the chopped
cabbage after the other seasoning has been removed.




CALCUTTA BISQUE

Put 1 cup of tomato pulp in a saucepan and with it 1 bay leaf. When
hot add to it 1 saltspoon of soda, and as it foams stir slowly into it
3 or 4 cups of milk, 1 teaspoon of curry powder, 1 teaspoon of butter,
and 1 saltspoon of salt. Let boil up once and serve with croutons.

The water in which rice has boiled or any vegetable stock may be
substituted for milk and the soda then omitted.




CANTON STEW

Put 2 cups of finely shredded cabbage in enough water to boil and let
cook slowly until tender, which should be in about three quarters of
an hour. When the cabbage has been cooking half an hour, add a cup of
milk, and when it is nearly done put in 2 cups of milk; let boil up
once, then season with salt, black pepper, and pour in a hot tureen,
in which should be laid 1 teaspoon of butter. Those who like oyster
crackers served in or with milk stews can use them with this soup
which greatly resembles an oyster stew in flavour.




CARROT BROTH

Scrape and cut 3 or 4 large carrots (or more of the small French sort)
in eighths lengthwise and boil them until tender. Put 2 tablespoons of
butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1 scant half cup of oatmeal
to it, putting in 1 tablespoon at a time and stirring carefully with
a wooden spoon until all the butter is taken up; then put in 1 ladle
of stock in which the carrots have been cooked, and continue stirring;
then another ladle of stock, and so on until a cup and a half of stock
has been added during ten minutes' slow cooking. Now put in another cup
of stock and let cook ten minutes; then, as the soup will be getting
too thick, add another cup of stock and so on, thinning the soup with
additional stock until the oatmeal is thoroughly cooked. If Quaker
Oats is used, the soup will only have to cook about forty minutes,
and it is best to strain it before serving; fine Scotch meal will take
longer, but does not need to be strained and thickens somewhat better.

When the soup is half cooked add 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of
pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. (Serve the carrots with a plain sauce
or warm them up next day in some of the ways mentioned under Carrots.)




CREAM OF CARROT AND ONION

Take 2 cups of grated carrot and 1 chopped onion and fry for ten
minutes with 1 tablespoon of butter and then cover with 4 cups of
cold water and let boil. Add salt and pepper and in twenty minutes
1 cup of milk in which 1 tablespoon of flour has been dissolved.




CREAM OF CARROTS

Put 2 cups of grated carrot with 1 pint (2 cups) of cold water in
a double boiler, and when heated add 2 tablespoons of butter and 1
teaspoon of sugar. Let cook for an hour, then add 1/2 cup of stale
bread crumbs and 2 cups of water, and let cook half an hour longer. Rub
the contents of the double boiler through a fine sieve, add 1 1/2 cups
of hot milk, 1 tablespoon of salt and a saltspoon of pepper, and return
to the boiler. Beat 2 egg-yolks in 1/2 cup of milk, and when the soup
boils again stir them into it. Stir hard for one minute and serve.




CREAM OF CHEESE

Put 1 quart (or 4 cups) of milk in a double boiler, and put with it
3/4 of a cup of grated cheese, 1 teaspoon of grated onion, 1 teaspoon
of some piquant sauce, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, a dash of cayenne pepper,
and 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 of butter rubbed together. Stir until
smooth, then beat the yolks of 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of milk,
put in the tureen, and pour the boiling soup over them, stirring
during the process. Add a little salt and serve with croutons.




CREAM OF CAULIFLOWER

Take a good-sized cauliflower, and let it soak in cold water, which
is slightly salted, for half an hour; then drain it and put it, head
upwards, in a saucepan which is not over large, and let it cook for
half an hour uncovered. Put in a double boiler 1 quart of milk (4
cups), 1 onion and 1 bay leaf, and let them cook together while the
cauliflower is boiling. Drain the cauliflower when done, and reserve
1/2 cup of the little sprays which form the head, mash the remainder
in a wooden bowl, and add to it 2 cups of the stock in which it boiled
and put in with the boiling milk; stir well, and let cook five minutes,
then put through a sieve and return to the fire with a thickening of
1 tablespoon of flour rubbed together with 1 tablespoon of butter,
season lightly with salt and pepper and a dash of nutmeg, add the
1/2 cup of cauliflower as a garnish, and let cook ten minutes more
before serving. A tablespoon of whipped cream is an addition if added
at the last.




CHESTNUT SOUP

Peel and blanch 1 quart of Italian chestnuts and chop them fine, then
boil for half an hour in 2 quarts of water. Strain the chestnuts and
crush them to fine pulp in a mortar, and gradually stir on this 1 quart
of the stock in which the chestnuts cooked, and then rub all through
a sieve. Return to the fire in a saucepan with 1 cup of bread crumbs,
1 tablespoon of salt, and 1 saltspoon of pepper. Cook for half an hour,
then strain again, and add 2 cups of milk and a grating of nutmeg,
and 1 tablespoon of browned butter, and reheat to boiling point.




CREAM OF CELERY

Wash and scrape and cut into half-inch pieces what will make 1 cup
of celery; put it into 1 quart of boiling salted water and cook for
nearly an hour or until very soft, then mash it in the water in which
it was boiled. Put 1 teaspoon of chopped onion, 2 bay leaves, some
mace, and 2 cloves into 2 cups of milk, let simmer for ten minutes,
and add it to the celery pulp. Now press through a sieve and return
to the double boiler in which the milk was cooked. Melt 1 tablespoon
of butter and blend it with 1 tablespoon of flour until smooth, and
stir it into the boiling soup; then season with salt and pepper. Boil
five minutes and strain into a hot tureen in which a pat of butter
and 1 tablespoon of whipped cream have been put. The addition of 1
tablespoon of chopped chives is an improvement to the appearance and
taste, or parsley may be used if preferred.




CREAM OF CHESTNUT

Shell and blanch and cut in quarters 2 cups (1 pound) of Italian
chestnuts and cover them with 2 cups of boiling water. Add 1 slice
of onion (or a drop of onion juice extract), 1/4 cup of chopped
celery (or 1 teaspoon celery seed), 1 bay leaf, 1 sprig of parsley,
and 1 saltspoon of paprika. Cover and boil until the chestnuts are
tender,--about half an hour. Then grind in a mortar, or press through
a colander or vegetable mill, and add 1 quart (4 cups) of milk, and
1 tablespoon of butter and 1 of flour rubbed together, and cook for
three minutes; then add 1 teaspoon of salt, and press all through a
fine sieve and reheat before serving.




CREAM OF CORN

Put 1 quart of milk and 1 can of corn in a double boiler and let boil;
mix 1 teaspoon of butter and 1 of cornstarch or potato-flour together,
and add to the corn; season with salt and pepper, and stir for one
minute; then press through a sieve and add 1 tablespoon of minced
green peppers.




COCKIE-LEEKIE

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted stir in,
a spoonful at a time, 1 cup of pearl barley, taking ten minutes to add
it all; then cover with 8 cups of carrot or onion broth (or use water),
and add 2 bay leaves, 1 onion with 4 cloves stuck in it, a bouquet
of herbs and parsley, 1 stalk of celery, and let simmer for one hour
and a half, then strain, reserving some of the barley. Prepare leeks
by washing and cutting into 2-inch lengths (using some of the green),
and slicing lengthwise, and add them to the soup; put in the barley,
and let cook twenty-five minutes and season with salt and pepper.




CREOLE SOUP

Put 1 can of tomatoes, 1 quart of water or vegetable stock, 1 sliced
onion, and 1 small sliced carrot, and 1 chopped green pepper together
in a saucepan, and let cook for half an hour, then rub through a
fine strainer. Return the strained mixture to the double boiler
and put in 2 scant tablespoons of boiled rice, 1 teaspoon of salt,
1/8 teaspoon paprika, 1 tablespoon of sugar. Cream 2 tablespoons of
butter with 1 tablespoon of flour, and stir into the soup; let boil
up once and serve.




CREAM OF CURRY

Put 1 quart (or 4 cups) of milk in a double boiler with 1 onion
with 4 cloves stuck in it, and when hot thicken it with 1 tablespoon
of thickening flour rubbed smooth with 1 tablespoon of butter; add
2 tablespoons of boiled rice, and 1 hard-boiled egg chopped fine,
and 2 teaspoons (more if liked) of curry powder or paste. Remove the
onion and serve with croutons. One tablespoon of chopped chives or
pimentos is an addition to the soup.




FLORENTINE SOUP

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and put into it 3/4 of
a cup of finely chopped onions and stir over a moderate heat about
five minutes and then add 2 full cups of very thinly sliced turnips;
stir these with the onions for another five minutes and then add 2
tablespoons of flour and gradually add 2 pints of boiled milk mixing
all well together; watch it till it boils and then let simmer gently,
stirring frequently during twenty minutes or half an hour, until the
onions are quite soft. Then add 2 more cups of milk, and when this
boils add 1 cup of tomato puree (either canned tomato soup or canned
tomatoes), or 1 1/2 cups of sliced fresh tomatoes, using a pinch of
soda to prevent curdling. Now press the contents of the saucepan
through a fine sieve, add a heaping teaspoon of butter, reheat,
and serve with croutons and 1 tablespoon of whipped cream.




HEILBRONN SOUP

Take 3 quarts of water in which vegetables have been boiled (preferably
onions or leeks) and let simmer. In another enamelled pan put 1
tablespoon of butter; when melted stir in slowly with a wooden spoon
1/2 cup of barley, adding a little at a time, until butter is well
"taken up." Let it cook for five minutes, stirring constantly, then add
(a ladle at a time) 6 or 8 ladles of the hot stock, putting in this
amount during ten minutes of stirring. Add 1/2 the remaining stock,
and salt, pepper, and some nutmeg, and let simmer twenty minutes; then
the remaining stock and simmer another one-half hour. Peel 1/4 pound
mushrooms and cut in 4 or 6 pieces each; fry them in butter for five
minutes, and add to soup ten minutes before serving and season afresh.




JULIENNE SOUP

Strain any clear vegetable soup, and to each 2 cups of broth add 1/2
cup of dried "Julienne;" season with salt and pepper and 1 tablespoon
of browned butter.




RED LENTIL SOUP

Soak 2 cups of Egyptian lentils in water for eight or ten hours, then
drain and shake dry. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan and
when melted add 1/3 of the lentils and stir well with a flat-ended
wooden spoon, letting them cook very slowly; then add another third,
and after stirring a few moments, add the remainder. Pour on 6 cups
of cooled water in which leeks or onions have boiled, and let simmer
for an hour or until the lentils are tender; press through a sieve
and return to the fire to reheat. Smooth 1 teaspoon of flour with 1
teaspoon of butter and add to the soup, season with salt and pepper and
a dash of nutmeg. Instead of the flour and butter 1 well-beaten egg may
be vigorously stirred into the soup after removing it from the fire.

If Egyptian lentils cannot be obtained, canned or dried red kidney
beans may be substituted.




CREAM OF LENTIL

Wash 2 cups of Egyptian lentils, then let them soak in 2 quarts of
water for twelve hours or more and put them, in this same water, where
they will simmer gently over a slow fire. Put 1 tablespoon of butter
in a frying pan, and when melted add to it 2 large onions, sliced, 2
carrots and 1 turnip diced, and fry until a delicate brown; add these
to the lentils and let cook slowly for about two hours. Press through a
sieve, return to the fire, add 2 cups of milk and just before serving,
1 tablespoon of whipped cream, and season with salt and pepper.




HUNGARIAN SOUP

Put 1 cup of German lentils in a saucepan with 2 cups of cold water or
vegetable stock, and let boil for an hour. If the water is absorbed
before the lentils are tender, add a little more. At the end of the
hour pour over them 6 cups of hot water or stock.

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1
small onion chopped fine and 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 clove of
garlic. When browned add this to the soup and at the same time put
in 1/2 cup of diced potatoes. Let simmer gently for half an hour,
then press through a sieve, return to the fire, season well with salt
and pepper, and add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or reduced vinegar
before serving.




PURÉE MONGOLE

Put 1 can of tomatoes in a saucepan and with it 2 cups of strong
vegetable broth, 1 stalk of celery, 1 slice of onion, 1 bay leaf,
3 allspice, 3 cloves, salt and pepper, and let cook slowly for half
an hour. Pour the liquid through a sieve, pressing with it as much of
the tomato as will go, reserving the celery. Return to the saucepan,
add 1 tablespoon of reduced vinegar, 1 tablespoon of boiled peas,
1 tablespoon of canned string beans, split in half, and the cooked
stalk of celery shredded into thin strips two inches long; let simmer
for five minutes, season with salt and pepper, add 1 tablespoon of
butter, remove from the fire, and beat vigorously into the soup 1
well-beaten egg.




MUSHROOM BISQUE

Cut up with a silvered knife about 1 cup of fresh mushrooms, wash and
drain, toss about in 2 tablespoons of melted butter for ten minutes,
then stir in 1 tablespoon of flour made smooth in a little milk, and
add 1 quart of milk and let simmer half an hour. Season with salt and
paprika, and press through a sieve, reserving half the mushrooms. Add
these to the soup, and serve with croutons.




MUSHROOM SOUP

Take 1/4 of a pound of fresh mushrooms, 3/4 of a cup of small white
beans, the rind of half a lemon, 1 Spanish onion in which 5 cloves
have been stuck, a small piece of mace, some parsley and thyme,
and, after preparing for cooking, let boil for an hour or more in 2
quarts of water; then press all but a few of the mushrooms through a
wire strainer, return to the saucepan, add 2 tablespoons of butter,
pepper, and salt, 1/2 teaspoon of soup browning, and, after cutting
them in several pieces, add the reserved mushrooms and serve.




MUSHROOM STEW

Select mushrooms that are white and firm and small, wash them carefully
one at a time with the hands, and put 1 heaping cup of them into
4 cups of milk and let heat, without boiling, for 15 minutes. Then
add 1 tablespoon of butter, plenty of salt and pepper, and serve in
a hot tureen with crisp crackers.




NOODLE OR ALPHABET SOUP

Strain any one of the vegetable soups for stock, add 1/2 cup of
noodles or "alphabets" fifteen minutes before serving.




CREAM OF ONION SOUP

Chop enough onions to make 4 cups, and put them in a large saucepan
with 2 tablespoons of butter and stir them for five minutes; then
add 1 small onion with 4 cloves stuck in it, a sprig of parsley,
and a bay leaf, cover with 6 or 7 cups of water, add salt and pepper,
and let cook gently for three quarters of an hour. Press all through
a sieve, and return the liquid to the saucepan; add 1 tablespoon of
flour blended with 1 tablespoon of butter, also 2 cups of milk (or
half cream), and let boil up once before serving. One tablespoon of
chopped chives may be added, also 1 tablespoon of whipped cream.




OKRA SOUP

Cut into small pieces 2 cups (1 can) of okra, use 1 can of green
peas, 1 of green corn, 1 cup of shell beans, 2 onions, 1 slice of
carrot, 1 slice of turnip, 2 tomatoes, and some celery, or use celery
salt. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when melted
add the chopped onion, carrot, and turnip, and cook ten minutes;
then put with the okra, celery and beans into 4 cups of water. Cook
for one hour, then add salt and pepper and the tomatoes, corn, peas,
and celery, and simmer for half an hour. Do not strain to serve,
but if too thick, thin with stock or water.




ONION SOUP AU FROMAGE

Slice 6 ordinary onions or 3 large Spanish ones, and put in frying pan
with 2 heaping tablespoons of butter, and let fry very slowly until
the onions are a rich dark brown,--about fifteen minutes; then scrape
the contents of the pan into a large marmite, add 1 large tablespoon
of butter, some pepper and salt, and nearly fill the casserole with
tepid water, or with water in which onions have boiled; cover and
let cook slowly half an hour, and then stir in 2 teaspoons of soup
browning. Take 4 thick slices of dry rye bread, spread them thickly
with grated cheese, and lay these in the soup pot; remove the cover
and let cook five minutes more, and serve in the marmite.




NEW GREEN PEA SOUP

Shell half a peck of peas and wash the pods. Put the pods in a large
kettle and almost cover with boiling water; let them simmer for half
an hour, then strain these out, and put the peas in this water to boil
until tender. The length of time this takes depends on the freshness
of the peas. Save out 1 cup of the peas and press the remainder,
water and all, through a sieve, and add to them 1 pint of milk,
then return to the fire. Rub together 1 tablespoon of flour and one
of butter and stir into the boiling soup; then add the reserved cup
of peas, season with salt and pepper, and serve. If the flavour of
mint is liked, put 3 or 4 mint leaves, or 1 teaspoon of chopped mint,
into the tureen. If mint is not used add a little chopped parsley.




CREAM OF GREEN PEA SOUP

Put 1 can of peas, 1 chopped onion, and 1 cup of water in a saucepan,
and cook twenty minutes. At the same time put 1 quart of milk on the
fire in a double boiler. When the milk is hot stir in 1 tablespoon of
butter, and as it boils, 1 tablespoon of flour which has been dissolved
in a quarter of a cup of milk. Rub the peas through a fine sieve,
stir into the milk, season with salt and pepper, add 1 teaspoon of
chopped parsley, and serve. Instead of the parsley, chopped mint can
be used if the flavour is liked, or 1 or 2 mint leaves laid in the
tureen before the soup is poured in give a delicate flavour.




SPLIT GREEN PEA SOUP

Soak 2 cups of peas for twelve hours or more, and then drain and
toss them for ten minutes in a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of butter
and 1 tablespoon of chopped onion; then add 4 cups of hot water
and let cook two hours, and press through a sieve with the water in
which they cooked. Add 1 cup of milk and 1 teaspoon of chopped mint
(fresh or dried), and 1 tablespoon whipped cream. Season well with
salt and pepper.




PRINCESS SOUP

Slice 3 onions and cook in a scant half cup of butter for ten
minutes. Add 1 quart of hot milk and cook slowly another ten
minutes. Strain into double boiler, thicken with 1 teaspoon of flour
dissolved in a little milk, and just before serving add 2 teaspoons of
finely chopped canned pimentos, and salt and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon
of cream in serving.




POTATO SOUP

Wash 6 to 9 potatoes and put them in boiling water and boil them from
twenty minutes to half an hour, the time depending on their size. Use
1 large onion quartered, with cloves stuck in it, and 2 pieces of
celery (or 1/4 teaspoon of celery salt or celery seed), some mace,
1 bay leaf, and 6 peppercorns, and put in a double boiler with 1
quart of milk, from which reserve 1 small half cup. Mix 1 tablespoon
of flour with the reserved milk, and stir slowly into the milk when
it boils, and let cook ten minutes longer. When the potatoes are done
pour off the water, peel them and mash until light, then add to the
boiling milk, stir well, season with salt and pepper, and rub all
through a sieve. Return to double boiler, add 1 tablespoon of butter,
1 teaspoon of minced parsley, boil up once, and serve.




GERMAN POTATO SOUP

The German potato soup is made by rubbing 6 or 8 well-boiled potatoes
through a sieve together with enough of the water in which they were
cooked to make sufficient soup, and adding 1 tablespoon of chopped
chives (or shallot or onion), 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, 1/2 cup of
sour cream containing a little lemon juice, or, instead of sour cream,
1 tablespoon of reduced vinegar can be used, with 1/2 cup of fresh
cream. Let simmer for fifteen minutes and serve very hot with croutons.




POTATO SOUP FLORA

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1
large onion chopped fine, stir until browned, then add 3 cups of
thinly sliced potatoes and 6 cups of cold water; when the potatoes
are cooked to a mush press them through a sieve, add a small piece
of butter, pepper, and salt, and 1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley.




CREAM OF RICE SOUP

Put 1/2 cup of rice into 1 1/2 pints of boiling water, and add 2 onions
into which 4 cloves are pressed, a piece of celery (or 1/4 teaspoon
celery seed), one bay leaf, 1 sprig of parsley, 4 peppercorns, and a
bit of mace. Let simmer gently for one hour, then turn the soup into
a large bowl, pouring it through a fine sieve, and pressing as much
through the sieve as possible. Return the contents of the bowl to the
saucepan and add 1 pint of milk, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of
butter, and 1 scant tablespoon of flour dissolved in a little milk. Add
1 tablespoon of chopped Spanish pimentos, 1 teaspoon finely chopped
chives, let simmer five minutes, add 1 tablespoon of whipped cream,
and serve.




RICE AND TOMATO SOUP

Boil 1 cup of rice in 2 quarts of water. Heat the contents of 1 can
of tomatoes with 1 bay leaf, 2 slices of onion, and, after fifteen
minutes' cooking, press through a sieve and put in double boiler,
and to this add 1 pint of water in which rice has been boiled. When
hot put in 1 teaspoon of butter, some pepper, salt, and a dash of
celery salt, and 2 tablespoons of the cooked rice, and serve. The
boiled rice can be utilised for the same meal, or used later.




RICE-OKRA SOUP

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan, and when melted
add 1 sliced onion and let simmer for five minutes; then stir in 1
tablespoon of flour, and when smooth and browned add 6 cups of water;
season well and let cook slowly for three quarters of an hour. In
another saucepan put 1/4 cup of rice and 2 cups of sliced okra,
and strain the hot stock over the rice and okra, season well with
salt and pepper, cover closely, and let simmer gently for an hour. If
fresh okra is not available the canned okra is a very good substitute;
but if it is used, do not add it to the rice and stock until twenty
minutes before removing the soup from the fire.




OYSTER PLANT (SALSIFY) SOUP

Use enough salsify to make 4 cups when sliced. Soak in cold water
for an hour, then scrape and put in fresh water, containing some
lemon juice, for fifteen minutes. The salsify must not be left out
of the water, or it will turn dark. Cut in thin slices, and put into
a saucepan containing 4 cups of water and 1/2 cup of milk, and let
cook slowly for about an hour, adding 1 teaspoon of salt when it has
cooked half the time. Reserve 1/4 of a cup of the salsify, and press
the remainder, with the stock, through a sieve; return to the saucepan,
add 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1 cup of cream, and 1 tablespoon of butter
rubbed together with 1 tablespoon of flour (or less if a thick soup
is not liked), a little salt, a dash of paprika and pepper, and serve
very hot with small crackers.




SPINACH-TOMATO SOUP

Put 1 tablespoon of butter into the frying pan, and when melted add
1 onion chopped fine, and let cook slowly for ten minutes. Put 1
cup of cold prepared spinach into the butter and onion and 1 cup
of tomato sauce or tomatoes, and let heat through. Put 2 cups of
milk in a double boiler with 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 of butter
rubbed together. Add a pinch of soda to the tomato-spinach mixture,
press it through a sieve, and stir the purée into the milk when it
boils. Season with salt and pepper and add 1 tablespoon of cream.




CREAM OF SPINACH

Put the contents of 1 can of spinach in a chopping-bowl and chop it
to a fine pulp; then put it in a double boiler with 2 tablespoons of
onion juice (grated onion), and some salt and pepper, and 5 or 6 cups
of milk. Let all cook together for twenty minutes, then pour through
a sieve, pressing the spinach to extract the juice. Return the soup
to the double boiler, add 1 tablespoon of butter, re-season with salt
and pepper and a pinch of nutmeg or mace, and some celery salt. A
tablespoon of whipped cream added at the last is an improvement, or
1 tablespoon of finely chopped white and riced yolk of hard-boiled
egg can be added. The spinach itself can be prepared next day in any
of the ways described for serving spinach.




FRENCH SORREL SOUP

Wash 1 quart of sorrel and put it to cook in cold water, remove from
the fire in ten minutes and drain and chop fine. Put 2 tablespoons of
butter in a saucepan and fry in it when melted 1 small onion chopped
fine; then add the sorrel to this and stir for three or four minutes
and add 2 cups of cold milk and let simmer for five minutes. Dissolve
in 1 cup of milk, 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of potato flour
(or other thickening), and add to the boiling soup; then strain,
reheat, and serve with the addition of 1 tablespoon of whipped cream.




GERMAN SORREL SOUP

The Germans enrich the above soup by pouring it upon a 1/2 cup of
milk in which the yolks of 2 eggs have been beaten. Do not reverse
the process, as it will curdle the soup.




ST. GERMAIN SOUP

Take 2 cans of peas, reserving 1/2 cup of them, and put them in a
double boiler with 1 onion cut in 4 pieces with a clove stuck in each,
1 tablespoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1
bay leaf, and a sprig of parsley; cover and let cook for half an hour,
then mash the contents of the double boiler with a potato-masher,
and add to them 6 cups of water, and when this boils add to the soup
2 tablespoons of butter and 2 of flour rubbed together; stir well
and cook fifteen minutes, then press through a sieve. Return to the
double boiler, add 2 cups of milk, the 1/2 cup of peas drained dry,
and reheat, seasoning afresh before serving with croutons.




SPAGHETTI SOUP

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large saucepan, and add to it 1
thinly sliced onion, 2 slices of carrot, 2 slices of turnip, 1/2 cup
of chopped celery (or 1 teaspoon of celery seed may be used instead),
and let cook very slowly. Stir frequently, and at the end of ten
minutes add 2 cloves, 10 or 12 peppercorns, a small piece of cinnamon,
and 1 large bay leaf, and 8 cups (or 2 quarts) of cold water. Cover
the saucepan and let the soup cook slowly three quarters of an hour,
then strain carefully and return to the saucepan. Season with 1
teaspoon of salt, and add 1/2 cup of spaghetti broken into inch-long
pieces. Cover the saucepan and let the soup simmer for an hour, as
this will draw more flavour from the spaghetti than rapid boiling,
and is the better way for a soup, since the object is to extract the
flavour of the ingredients. Grated or Parmesan cheese served with
this soup is an improvement.




SCOTCH BROTH

Put 2 quarts of water in kettle, and when at boiling point add 1/2 cup
of pearl barley, which has been tossed in hot butter in a frying pan
for five minutes, and let cook slowly. Cut up 2 carrots, 2 turnips,
and 3 large onions, and fry in 2 tablespoons of butter. Chop a sprig
of parsley very fine, and put with the other vegetables into the barley
and water. Let cook slowly for two hours, season with pepper and salt,
and serve. A 1/2 teaspoon of soup-browning improves the appearance
of the broth.




SPANISH TOMATO SOUP

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted stir into
it 3 onions thinly sliced, and let simmer for ten minutes; then add
to them the juice from 1 can of tomatoes and 2 of the tomatoes, and
let cook slowly for twenty minutes; strain, pressing through a sieve,
return to the fire, add 1 tablespoon of butter, some pepper and salt,
and stir in 2 well-beaten eggs. Do not let the soup boil after adding
the eggs.




TOMATO-TAPIOCA SOUP

Put 2 quarts of water into a double boiler, and when it boils add
1/2 cup of tapioca. Slice 6 large tomatoes (or use 2 cups of strained
canned tomatoes), cut 2 onions fine, and fry together until a light
brown in 1 tablespoon of butter. Scrape the contents of the pan into
the kettle and let simmer slowly for an hour and a half, then season
well and serve.




TOMATO CREAM SOUP

Take 2 cups of canned tomatoes, juice and all, mash the large
pieces to a pulp, and place in a saucepan with 1 1/2 cups of hot
water and a piece of butter the size of an egg, a pinch of pepper,
1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 bay leaf. Let come to a boil, and then
add 1/4 teaspoon of carbonate of soda, stir for one minute, and add
2 cups of milk. Let boil up and pour in tureen in which is a 1/2 cup
of cracker crumbs very finely rolled. Use this way for ordinary use,
or strain to serve in cups.




TOMATO AND CORN BISQUE

Put 1 quart of milk and 1 can of corn in a double boiler and let
simmer fifteen minutes; then add 1 teaspoon of butter, season well
with salt and pepper, and press through a sieve, and put back into
the double boiler. Add 1/2 cup of boiled tomatoes which have been
pressed through a sieve, stir together, reheat, and serve.




TOMATO-MACARONI SOUP

Put 1 can of tomatoes, 1 sprig of parsley, 1 onion with 4 cloves stuck
in it, 1 tablespoon of salt, 6 peppercorns, and 6 cups of cold water
in a saucepan, and let cook slowly for three quarters of an hour;
then strain and return to the saucepan, and when boiling again, add
1/2 cup of macaroni which has been broken into small pieces, and cover
and cook for half an hour. Season afresh before serving. Spaghetti
or noodles may be used instead of macaroni.




TOMATO SOUP

Let 1 quart can of tomatoes, 2 cups of water (or rice stock),
a sprig of parsley, 1 bay leaf, and 1 onion simmer together for
fifteen minutes, then press through a sieve and return to the fire to
boil. Rub 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of flour together,
and stir into the boiling soup until smooth. Add salt, pepper, and
a pinch of soda, and serve immediately with croutons. If water in
which rice has boiled is used omit the flour and the soda.




TOMATO-OKRA SOUP

Into 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) of boiling water put 1/2 cup of rice;
cover and let boil fifteen minutes, then add the contents of 1 can
of "tomato-okra" and cook ten minutes more. Reserve 2 okra pods, 2
tomatoes, and 1 tablespoon of rice, and press all the rest through a
sieve. Return to the fire, season with salt and pepper, and add the
rice and tomatoes and the okra cut in thin slices.




MULLIGATAWNY SOUP

Make as above, but strain, reserving a little rice and a little
tomato to add later; stir 1 tablespoon of curry paste (or powder)
into the soup, reheat, and serve.




VEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 1

Cut in tiny squares 1 potato, 1 onion, 1/2 turnip, 1 carrot, and 1
root of celery. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, add all
the vegetables except the potato, and fry until a delicate brown. Then
scrape the contents of the frying pan into a kettle containing 2 quarts
of cold water, 1 teaspoon of salt, 3 tablespoons of rice, 1 bay leaf,
and a bunch of soup herbs. Let cook slowly for one hour and a half,
and then add the potatoes and boil twenty minutes more. Add pepper,
a little fresh salt, and 1 teaspoon soup-browning, and, if a thin
soup is preferred, strain out most of the vegetables and rice. These
may be served with brown sauce and put in individual crust cups made
hot in oven after being filled.




VEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 2

When seasonable another vegetable soup may be made, proceeding as
above, but adding cauliflower and young onions instead of carrots,
etc., and thinning with 1 1/2 cups of hot milk and adding at the
last 1/2 cup of boiled young peas. Add butter, pepper, and salt,
and a spoonful of cream, before serving.




VEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 3

Put 1 generous tablespoon of butter in a large saucepan, and fry in
the butter when melted 1/2 cup of chopped onion, and when a golden
brown stir in carefully 1 tablespoon of flour, and when smoothed
pour on slowly 2 cups of hot water or vegetable stock. Now put in
1/2 cup each of chopped carrot, turnip, parsnip, and 1 cup of celery,
and dredge well with pepper and salt, and cover with boiling water,
and let simmer for one hour. Then put in 2 cups of parboiled potatoes,
and when the vegetables are soft press through a sieve with the stock
in which they have cooked.




VEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 4

A much more simple but very palatable vegetable soup is made by taking
1 cup of diced carrots and 1 cup of parsnips and 1 can of peas (or
fewer peas can be used), covering them with cold water, and after
one hour's boiling adding 2 cups of milk, to which should be added
when it boils 1 teaspoon of potato-flour, or other thickening, and,
before serving, pepper, salt, and a small piece of butter.




VEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 5

Slice and cut in fancy shapes 1 turnip, 1 carrot, 1 sweet potato,
the corn from 1 ear of corn, or use 2 tablespoons of canned corn,
and strain 1/2 can of peas, or 1/2 cup of fresh peas may be used. Put
3 quarts of water in a saucepan, and when boiling add 1 tablespoon of
rice and the carrot; let boil for half an hour, then put in the other
vegetables and cook for half an hour longer, and add 1 tablespoon
of chopped parsley before serving; also season highly with salt
and pepper.




CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUP

Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and add 3 tablespoons
each of chopped celery, turnip, and carrot, and 1 tablespoon of minced
onion, 4 bay leaves, and 4 blades of mace. Cook together very slowly
for twenty minutes, stirring frequently to prevent browning; then
shake in 3 tablespoons of flour, and when blended put the contents of
the frying pan into a little less than 3 pints of milk made hot in a
double boiler. Cook twenty minutes longer, and then season well with
salt and pepper, and pour into a saucepan containing 2 egg-yolks,
beaten with 1/2 cup of cream or milk. The soup can then be strained
and served without any, or with only a few, of the vegetables, or
it is delicious served without straining. It can be made at any time
that is convenient and reheated for serving.




PURÉE OF VEGETABLE MARROW
(SUMMER SQUASH)

Slice 3 onions and cover with 2 quarts of cold water, and when it
boils add a large vegetable marrow, cut in thin slices. Let simmer
slowly for two hours, then rub all through a sieve; mix 1 tablespoon of
ground rice, 1 cup of milk, and 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan,
and when hot add to the soup. Finish with 2 tablespoons of boiled
flageolets, or peas, and season well with salt and pepper.

            Loved the woodrose and left it on its stalk?

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES IN BUTTER

Wash 1 quart of artichokes, scrape them well, and lay them in salted
water to keep them from discolouring, then put them in salted, boiling
water which has been whitened with a little milk, and boil for twenty
or twenty-five minutes. Drain and arrange in a buttered baking dish;
pour over them 3 tablespoons of melted butter, and sprinkle the tops
with browned bread crumbs finely rolled, and set them in the oven
for five minutes.

This dish makes a dainty entremets when served in individual gratin
dishes, in which case 2 or 3 artichokes should be arranged in each
dish. The little dish should be served on a small plate with a
paper doiley.




JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES AU GRATIN

Prepare the artichokes as in above recipe, arrange them in a large
baking dish, or in small individual dishes, cover them with white
sauce, sprinkle the top with grated cheese and crumbs, and put them
in the oven a few minutes to brown.




JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES WITH TOMATO SAUCE

Prepare the artichokes as in the first recipe, but instead of using
melted butter use a little tomato sauce, and sprinkle the artichokes
with browned crumbs, and let  heat a few moments in the oven before
serving. This also is a dainty dish to serve after the soup in
individual gratin dishes.




JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES WITH FRENCH SAUCE

Prepare as directed, and in the water in which the artichokes are
boiling put 1 large onion and a piece of celery finely chopped. After

it nicely, thicken with the yolk of an egg, and strain and pour over
the hot artichokes and serve.




JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE FRITTERS

Boil the artichokes not more than fifteen minutes, cut them into strips
1/4 of an inch thick, dry them, dip them in flour, and then in batter,
and fry a golden brown in good butter.




FRIED ARTICHOKES

Boil as directed, but do not quite finish cooking; let them cool,
slice them and fry in melted butter, adding 1 teaspoon of chopped
parsley just before removing from the pan.




FRENCH FRIED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES

Scrape and wash 1 quart of Jerusalem artichokes, cut in slices
lengthwise, and fry in a frying basket in hot vegetable fat or oil

Select small artichokes, or cut them round with a patent cutter, roll
them in yolk of egg and then in fine crumbs, place in a frying basket,
and fry in hot vegetable fat until a golden brown. Serve very hot,
garnished with parsley, and with a tureen of sauce Tartare. Serve
alone after soup.




FRIED ARTICHOKES WITH TOMATO SAUCE

Fry artichokes as in foregoing recipe and serve with hot tomato sauce.




JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES LYONNAISE

Boil the artichokes as directed, but do net let them quite finish
cooking, then slice them. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying

onions are transparent, but not brown, add the artichokes and fry
slowly. Sprinkle with chopped parsley or chives.




JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE PURÉE

Boil 1 quart of artichokes as already directed, drain, mash and press
through a fine sieve, and stir in 2 tablespoons of melted butter;
then stir over a low fire until the moisture is exhausted. Remove
from the fire, and when cold add 4 eggs which have been well beaten,
beating them briskly, and adding them slowly to the purée; also beat
in 1 tablespoon of whipped cream. When thoroughly mixed and light
from much beating put into a large mould, or into individual moulds,
and steam or poach with water half-way up the mould, and turn out and
serve with some good sauce, tomato or Hollandaise preferred, or the
sauce described as being made with the water in which the artichokes
were boiled can be used; to it should be added 1 teaspoon of finely
chopped parsley.




JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES NEWBURG

Make a sauce with 2 cups of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter mixed with
1 of flour, 2 yolks of eggs, and pepper and salt, and when thickened
add 2 tablespoons of sherry, and 3 cups of sliced boiled artichokes,
and 1/2 cup of blanched chopped almonds. Serve on toast or in cases.




FRENCH OR GLOBE ARTICHOKES

The globe artichoke is a most delicious addition to a vegetarian
menu, and it is not because it is not known to be edible, but because
many people do not know how either to eat it or to serve it, that
it is not oftener seen in America. I have had it served to me in
almost every European country and often in restaurants in America,
and have never encountered but one cook who knew how it should be
sent to the table after cooking, and one waiter who knew how to serve
it when it got there. It is usually served half cold with the leaves
falling all about it because the "thistle," and usually the best of
the artichoke besides, has been carelessly removed in the kitchen;
instead of which it should be served whole, as in this way only can
it be kept hot enough to be palatable. The artichoke should be set
stem end downward on a hot, flat dish and wound about at the base
with a small table napkin, and the person who serves it, holding
it in the napkin, should reverse it and taking a small, sharp,
silvered knife should cut through the artichoke on the bottom, using
a sawing motion, and with the help of a serving fork ease apart the
"thistle" and the closely knitted small leaves in the centre. Unless
the artichokes are very large ones, a half of one is not too much to
serve each person. The "thistle" should be removed by the server,
and this should be done by carefully separating it from the "fond"
or base, which is the fleshy part from which the leaves grow out. The
leaves should be taken one by one, by the dry tip, in the fingers,
and the fleshy end thus pulled from the base should be dipped in the
sauce served, and the soft portion removed by drawing it between the
front teeth; when the leaves are finished the base should be cut up
with a fork and eaten with the sauce.




TO STEAM GLOBE ARTICHOKES

Prepare for cooking as in the above recipe, place in a covered steamer,
and let steam forty minutes or until the leaves, when pulled, part
easily from the base.




TO BOIL GLOBE ARTICHOKES

Globe artichokes should not look dry and wrinkled when bought, but
green and fresh. Put them in cold salted water and a little vinegar
for fifteen minutes to cleanse and free from insects, then put them
in salted boiling water and boil until the leaves part easily from
the base when pulled; this should be in about half an hour, but the
time varies with the age and size of the artichoke; it should then
be drained and the stem cut off so that it will stand erect on the
serving dish.




GLOBE ARTICHOKES STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS

Cut the stalk from fresh artichokes and trim the leaves to an even
length, and boil them for twenty minutes, or until the choke or thistle
can be removed neatly. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan,
and when melted add 2 finely minced shallots (or use chives or onion
tops), and 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, and 1 cup of chopped fresh
or canned mushrooms, salt and pepper, and fry all together for five
minutes. Fill the artichoke with this, tie the leaves together and
set in a pan containing 1 cup of stock (or water), 2 tablespoons
of butter or olive oil, and bake them half an hour, basting them
thoroughly five or six times. Remove the strings, set upright and
serve very hot with Dutch butter, or any sauce preferred.




GLOBE ARTICHOKES VINAIGRETTE

Serve cold boiled artichokes, which have been cut in half and the
"thistles" removed, with sauce vinaigrette, which is French dressing
to which a little chopped onion or onion juice and chopped parsley
have been added.




FONDS D'ARTICHAUT

The bottom or solid part of the globe artichoke can be bought preserved
in bottles; heat them in their own liquid, drain, and serve hot with
Hollandaise sauce, or cold with sauce vinaigrette or mayonnaise.




ASPARAGUS

Asparagus should be carefully looked over and washed, and then
tied into a bunch with a piece of tape, with all the heads level,
then with a very sharp knife an inch or two of the stalks should
be so evenly cut off that the bunch will stand upright. Stand the
asparagus in a deep saucepan so that the tips are well out of the
water, add 1 teaspoon of salt, put a cover on the saucepan, and let
cook about half an hour or twenty-five minutes. In this way the tips
are sufficiently steamed by the time the stalks are cooked, and will
not be cooked to pieces as when immersed in water.




ASPARAGUS WITH WHITE SAUCE

Having boiled the asparagus as directed, lift it out by plunging a
sharp fork into it two or three inches from the bottom, lay it on a
hot plate on the top of the stove, cut the tape and arrange 4 or 5
pieces each on long strips of toast, and pour over each 2 tablespoons
of nicely seasoned white sauce; arrange neatly on a long platter with
the asparagus heads all turned one way.




ASPARAGUS WITH DUTCH BUTTER

Proceed exactly as in above recipe, but instead of the white sauce
pour a little melted butter over all, and serve with a small tureen
of Dutch butter.




HOT ASPARAGUS TIPS

Take a can of asparagus tips, drain and put in a saucepan with
2 tablespoons of melted butter into which some paprika has been
shaken. When hot garnish with diamonds of toast to serve, and sprinkle
with salt.




WHITE ASPARAGUS

Open canned asparagus at the bottom, and after draining, ease it
from the can, so as to prevent the tips from being injured. Lay the
stalks evenly in a shallow enamelled pan, cover with hot water or
the juice from the can, and let heat through over a slow fire. Remove
after ten minutes' cooking to a heated flat dish, using a strainer to
lift the stalks from the water. Serve with Dutch butter, into which
a few browned crumbs have been stirred, or chopped chives can be used
instead of crumbs. The asparagus can also be served with tomato sauce.




ASPARAGUS VINAIGRETTE

Place the can of asparagus to be used on the ice for half an hour,
then open and drain and rinse carefully in cold water. Place on
crisp lettuce leaves, using 5 or 6 stalks on each, and serve with
sauce vinaigrette.




FRIED TIPS WITH ONION BUTTER

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1
tablespoon of grated onion and the drained contents of 1 can of
asparagus tips. Let all cook together slowly for five minutes, and
season with salt and pepper.




ASPARAGUS TIPS WITH WHITE SAUCE

Heat 1 can of asparagus tips with 1 tablespoon of melted butter,
and to serve, cover with 3/4 of a cup of highly seasoned white sauce
in which the white of 1 hard-boiled egg has been mixed, after being
chopped fine. Sprinkle over the top the yolk of the egg pressed
through a sieve, and serve with squares of toast.




ASPARAGUS IN BREAD CASES

Boil 2 cups of asparagus tips in salted water for fifteen minutes,
and then drain them; while they are cooking put 1 cup of milk in a
double boiler, and when boiling pour some of it on to 2 lightly beaten
eggs, stirring vigorously meanwhile, and then put the eggs into the
double boiler with the milk, and stir until it begins to thicken. Add 1
teaspoon of butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 saltspoon of pepper,
and remove from the fire. Cut the asparagus tops into half-inch pieces
and add them to the sauce. Take 5 stale rolls, cut off the tops,
remove the inside, and let them dry in the oven; when crisp and hot
fill each with the asparagus in sauce, replace the top and serve.




ESCALLOPED ASPARAGUS

Use either fresh green asparagus, or canned asparagus. Cut it into
two-inch lengths, and if fresh is used cook in boiling water for
ten minutes. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan and brown
in it 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of finely chopped roasted
peanuts. Roll each bit of asparagus in beaten egg and the crumbs and
nut mixture, and arrange in a buttered gratin dish with alternate
layers of thick white sauce, seasoning each layer with a little pepper
and salt. Cover the top with crumbs and a sprinkling of grated cheese,
and brown in the oven.




GRIDDLED APPLES

Peel and core large sour apples. Cut them in thick slices and lay
on a well-buttered griddle, and let fry until a light brown; turn,
and brown the other side.



APPLE FRITTERS

Pare and core as many tart apples as required, sprinkle with salt,
dip in batter, and fry until golden brown in hot fat. Drain on brown
paper before serving.




BOILED BANANAS

Put bananas unpeeled into boiling water, let boil for ten minutes,
then peel and cut in two and serve with melted butter.




BANANAS WITH TOMATOES

Peel 3 bananas and cut them in slices either lengthwise or across, and
slice 3 or 4 large tomatoes. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying
pan, and when melted lay in the bananas and tomatoes and sprinkle
well with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let cook slowly,
and when browned on the bottom turn and add another sprinkling of
sugar, brown again, and serve very hot.




BANANA FRITTERS

Pare the bananas required, cut each in half crosswise, and then split
each half. Sprinkle with salt and dip in batter and fry until a golden
brown in hot fat. Drain on brown paper and serve very hot.




BOSTON BAKED BEANS

Cover with cold water 3 or 4 cups of dry California pea beans, or
any small white beans, and let them soak over night. The next morning
drain and put on the stove in a large kettle well filled with water,
and let cook slowly, with 1/4 of a teaspoon of soda added, for half
an hour. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in the bean-pot, or a deep
baking dish, drain the beans, and put them in the butter. Pour over
them slowly 4 tablespoons of dark molasses, 1 tablespoon of salt,
and add 1 tablespoon of butter; then fill the bean-pot to the top
with hot water and bake in a very slow oven for 6 or 7 hours. As
the water cooks away replace it. This will require doing about three
times during the baking. Serve in the dish in which they were cooked,
and garnish with whole black pickled walnuts.




GREEN STRING BEANS

If fresh beans are used pick them over, remove the ends and
"strings," and boil for half an hour or more; then drain them, and
add 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of milk, season with
salt and pepper, and serve after ten minutes' slow cooking. If canned
beans are used omit the first long boiling.




GOLDEN WAX BEANS

If fresh beans are used wash, remove the ends and "strings," and
boil for three quarters of an hour, or until tender, in salted water;
then drain and add to them 1 tablespoon of butter, and 2 tablespoons
of milk, let cook slowly for ten minutes, and season well with salt
and pepper. In using canned beans omit the first boiling.




FRENCH BEANS (FLAGEOLETS)

Those in glass are the best; drain and put in a double boiler with 1
tablespoon of butter, pepper and salt, and 1 tablespoon of cream. Serve
very hot.




DRIED BEANS DEUTSCHLAND

Pick over 1 1/2 cups of dried beans of any sort, cover with water,
and soak ten hours or more. Drain and put in boiling water (or the
stock onions or leeks have boiled in), and let cook slowly for two
hours, or until tender but unbroken, then drain. Put 2 tablespoons
of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion chopped fine,
and let it cook slowly for ten minutes; then add the beans and season
with salt and pepper and put over them 2 tablespoons of lemon juice
or 1 tablespoon of "reduced vinegar," and let cook very slowly for
ten or fifteen minutes that all may be well blended before serving.




WHITE BEANS FLORENTINE

Soak 4 cups of white kidney beans for ten hours, then boil them two
hours. Slip the skins off and put them into a saucepan with 1 cup
of broth and a bunch of sweet herbs, 1 bay leaf, and 2 tablespoons
of Marsala or sherry. Cover and let them cook slowly for thirty
minutes. Remove the herbs and stir in 1 tablespoon of butter and
1 tablespoon of flour rubbed well together, stir until smooth, and
then pour on 1 cup of cream or milk into which 1 egg has been beaten;
continue to stir, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of
chopped parsley, and serve with grated cheese.




BEANS AND CORN ESCALLOPED

Use 1 can of green string beans, or Lima beans, and 1 can of sweet
corn. Butter a baking dish, and arrange a layer of beans; dot with
butter, and season with pepper and salt, then put on this a layer of
corn about half an inch deep, season, and so proceed until the dish
is filled. Then pour 1/2 cup of milk over all, sprinkle with bread
crumbs, and bake for fifteen minutes, or until the crumbs are browned.




ITALIAN BEANS

Use 3 cups of white haricot beans, soak for several hours, boil two
hours in salted water, then drain. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a
saucepan, and when melted add 1 large onion chopped fine and 2 bay
leaves. Let cook slowly for eight minutes, then put into the pan the
boiled beans, and season with salt and pepper; let heat through,
stirring gently, and add 1 cup of tomato sauce two minutes before
removing from the fire.

Canned brown or red beans may be used, giving the same dish practically
with far less trouble.




SPANISH BEANS

Soak for eight or ten hours any sort of large dried beans, then drain
them and put them into boiling water two hours or more, or until
cooked. One way of testing them is to remove a few and blow on them;
if the skins crack they are done. Drain, and put them in a bean-pot
or casserole and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of chopped onion and 2
cups of strained tomatoes, and dredge well with salt. Cover the dish
and bake slowly for an hour. A quarter of an hour before taking out,
pour over them 1 tablespoon of melted butter and remove the cover.




LIMA BEANS

Let Lima beans stand in cold water for an hour or so after they are
shelled, and in cooking them allow 8 cups of water to every 4 cups
of beans. Put them in boiling salted water, and let them cook for
an hour, or more if not fresh picked. Drain them and add 1/2 cup of
the water they cooked in, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter,
and season highly with salt and pepper.

Dried beans must soak ten or twelve hours and cook two hours. Canned
Lima beans only need reheating, draining, and a little milk and butter
and seasoning added to them.




LIMA BEANS HOLLANDAISE

Boil 1 quart of beans until tender, salting them well when half
cooked. Beat a large tablespoon of butter to a cream, beat in the
yolk of 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley, 1 saltspoon
of black pepper, and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice; when this sauce is
well mixed stir it into the beans, taking care not to break them.




CREAMED LIMA BEANS

Cover 2 cups of boiled Lima beans with 1 scant cup of cream, and let
simmer in a double boiler for ten minutes; then add 1 teaspoon of
butter, and season with salt, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg.




LIMA BEAN SAUQUETASH

Boil 2 cups of freshly picked Lima beans in 1 quart of water for half
an hour, then drain them and add 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter,
and enough green corn cut from the cob to make 2 cups. Season well,
and let simmer for fifteen minutes, and salt again before serving.

If canned corn and canned beans are used they need be cooked for only
ten minutes.




BEETS

Great care should be taken in washing beets that the small rootlets
are not broken or the skin of the beet bruised, as anything which
causes the juice to escape injures both the taste and the colour. In
the city, beets are seldom obtainable which require less than two or
three hours' cooking; but really young, small beets should not require
more than one hour's boiling. When boiled they should be drained, then
plunged into cold water, after which the skin can be rubbed off with
the hand. Some, however, prefer that beets should be baked or steamed;
the time required to cook will then be somewhat longer. Canned beets
are a great convenience.




CREAMED BEETS

Boil 6 or 7 medium-sized beets until tender, then remove them from the
saucepan and place them in cold water; rub the skins off carefully
with the hands, and cut them in half-inch cubes. Make a sauce of 2
tablespoons of butter creamed with 2 tablespoons of flour and 1/2 cup
of the water in which the beets were boiled, 2 tablespoons of cream,
2 tablespoons of vinegar, 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt,
and 1 saltspoon of pepper. Pour the sauce over the hot beets and
serve in a heated deep dish.




VIRGINIA BEETS

Carefully peel boiled beets, and with a sharp knife cut into very thin,
even slices, laying them as sliced into a heated vegetable dish; when
a layer has been made over the bottom, dot it well with butter, season
lightly with salt, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar;
then arrange another layer of beets with butter, salt, and sugar, and
proceed in this way until the dish is filled. The work should be done
near the fire in order that the beets may not cool, as the dish should
be served very hot. If, however, the beets have cooled in preparation,
set them in a hot oven for a few minutes, and turn them with a spoon
in the dish before serving in order that they may be juicy.




PICQUANT BEETS

Peel hot cooked beets, cut into slices, and toss about for three or
four minutes in a saucepan which contains 3 tablespoons of butter to
which has been added 1 teaspoon of plain vinegar, or a few drops of
tarragon, 2 cloves, and 1 teaspoon of sugar.




GERMAN BEETS

Make a sauce of 1 tablespoon of butter, when melted add 1 tablespoon of
flour, 2 teaspoons of onion juice, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon
of sugar, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and enough hot water to make
the sauce the right consistency; then add freshly sliced cooked beets,
and let cook together three or four minutes before serving.




PICKLED BEETS

Place slices of cold beets in a deep porcelain or glass receptacle,
place some peppercorns among them, and a few allspice, cover with
mild vinegar, and let stand ten or twelve hours before using.




BRUSSELS SPROUTS

Brussels sprouts are best if laid for ten minutes, after trimming
and looking over, in salted cold water which contains some lemon
juice. They should then be drained and put in a large saucepan filled
with boiling water containing salt and a pinch of soda. Parboil in this
ten minutes, then lift them with a strainer and put in a steamer above
the boiling water; cover, and let steam half an hour to finish cooking.

If sprouts are cooked by boiling instead of steaming, leave
the saucepan uncovered, as this will keep the odour from being
pronounced. Boil in salted water from twenty to thirty minutes,
drain the instant they are tender, and serve with melted butter.




BRUSSELS SPROUTS IN DUTCH BUTTER

Put boiled Brussels sprouts in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons of
melted butter, to which has been added a tablespoon of lemon juice;
stir until hot and add pepper and salt.




BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH CELERY

Trim and wash in cold running water 1 quart of Brussels sprouts;
then place them in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and let them
boil for five minutes; then drain and cover with fresh boiling water
containing 1 teaspoon of salt. Boil for another twenty-five minutes
uncovered, and then drain them. Wash enough celery to make 1 1/2
cups when cut in pieces one inch long, put this in a saucepan with
3 tablespoons of butter, stir well together, and add 1 1/2 cups of
scalded milk containing 2 tablespoons of flour; when this is thickened
add the sprouts, season with salt and pepper, and serve very hot.




BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH CHESTNUTS

To every cup of Brussels sprouts allow 1/2 cup of blanched chestnuts
which have been cooked for fifteen minutes; put the sprouts and
chestnuts together, cook another forty minutes, drain, and serve with
white sauce.




BRUSSELS SPROUTS LYONNAISE

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1
tablespoon of chopped onion; when this is beginning to brown add 4
cups of boiled sprouts, and stir together for three or four minutes,
unless the sprouts were cold, in which case they should be tossed
about with the butter and onion until hot.




CREAMED BRUSSELS SPROUTS

Cover freshly boiled Brussels sprouts with a white sauce made entirely
of milk, or of the stock in which they were cooked, with 1 tablespoon
of cream added.




BRUSSELS SPROUTS IN BREAD CASES

Cut stale bread into three-inch squares, and with a sharp knife cut
out the centre, leaving a bottom and four sides like a box; brush over
with melted butter, and brown in the oven. Serve sprouts prepared in
any of the above ways in these cases; the creamed sprouts are perhaps
the best served this way.




CABBAGE

Wash cabbage carefully after cutting it in half, and let it boil
for five minutes in well-salted boiling water; pour this water off
and re-cover with fresh boiling water; let cook for half an hour,
then add 1 teaspoon of salt, and let finish cooking, which will be
in about another half an hour for a medium-sized cabbage.

Cabbage should never be covered while boiling, as covering increases
the odour in cooking.




NEW ENGLAND CABBAGE

Cut a cabbage in quarters, wash it thoroughly, and parboil it for
five minutes in salted water; then drain and cook with 2 carrots and
2 turnips for an hour or until tender, in any strong vegetable stock,
to which 1 tablespoon of butter has been added. Drain and dampen with
a little of the stock to serve, and season well with salt and pepper.




WESTERN CABBAGE

Take 4 or 5 cups of shredded white cabbage and put in a frying pan
in which 1 tablespoon of butter has been melted. Press the cabbage
into the pan, dredge with salt and pepper, and pour over it 1/2 cup
of vinegar and 1/2 cup of water; cover and let cook very gently for
half an hour or somewhat less.

Red cabbage can be prepared in this same way, and a pretty dish is
made by using equal quantities of red and white cabbage.




CABBAGE SARMAS

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1 onion
chopped fine, and after it has cooked gently for ten minutes stir into
it 1 cup of boiled rice, 1/2 cup of chopped nuts, 1 teaspoon of salt,
1 saltspoon of pepper, and 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Parboil
a small cabbage for fifteen minutes, then separate its leaves, and
into each leaf roll 1 tablespoon of the force-meat; pack tightly in
a shallow pan, dredge with salt and pepper, and cover with the water
in which the cabbage cooked; lay 2 bay leaves on the top, and let
simmer for fifteen minutes. Serve with melted butter or tomato sauce.




CABBAGE LICHTENSTEIN

Cut one large cabbage into small pieces, not using the stalk. Wash
well and put in a kettle of boiling water with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1
tablespoon of caraway seed. Cook for half an hour uncovered, then add
to the cabbage 4 large potatoes peeled and quartered, season afresh
with salt, and let cook another twenty minutes. Put 2 tablespoons of
butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion chopped fine and
1 tablespoon of flour; let all cook together until brown, then scrape
the contents of the frying pan into the cabbage, etc., and cook slowly
for twenty minutes more, or until the stock is almost cooked away.




LADY CABBAGE

Boil firm white cabbage fifteen minutes, changing the water then for
more from the boiling teakettle; continue boiling for half an hour or
until tender, then drain and set aside until perfectly cold. Chop fine,
season with pepper and salt, add 1 or 2 well-beaten eggs, 1 tablespoon
of butter, and 1/2 cup of rich milk. Stir all well together and bake in
a buttered dish until brown. The oven should be moderately hot, and the
same care used as in the baking of a custard. Serve in the baking dish.




COLD SLAW

Put 2 tablespoons of vinegar on to boil in a saucepan, and add to
it when boiling 1/2 cup of sour or fresh milk or cream containing
2 lightly beaten eggs; stir and then add 1 tablespoon of butter,
salt and pepper, and pour over 4 cups of shredded cabbage arranged
in a deep bowl. Serve cold.




GERMAN RED CABBAGE

Put 3 or 4 cups of shredded red cabbage into a saucepan with 1
tablespoon of butter, 1 finely chopped apple, and the juice of half
a lemon; sprinkle lightly with sugar, season with salt and pepper,
cover, and let cook from half to three quarters of an hour.




HUNGARIAN CABBAGE

Quarter a red cabbage, remove the stalk parts and wash well, and
put it in a kettle containing enough boiling water to cover it. Let
boil for three quarters of an hour or until tender, and then drain,
gently pressing out all the water. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a
frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion chopped fine and 1 tablespoon
of flour; stir until smooth and let cook until brown. Then add 1/2
cup of brown sugar, 1/3 of a cup of vinegar, and salt well. Add the
shredded cabbage to this, and let all simmer together for fifteen or
twenty minutes before serving.




PICKLED RED CABBAGE

Chop or shred enough cabbage to make 2 quarts (8 cups) and add to it 1
large onion chopped fine and 1 tablespoon of salt; mix well together
and let stand over night in a covered jar. Next day press through
a colander to drain, and then place a layer of cabbage in a jar,
sprinkle over it a few mustard seeds and 2 or 3 cloves, and proceed
in this way until the cabbage is all used. Do not press down. Cover
with cider vinegar, and use any time after twenty-four hours.




CREAMED CARROTS

Scrape and wash enough carrots to make 4 cups when cut in dice,
and put them in a double boiler containing half milk and half water
at boiling point. Let them cook slowly for forty minutes or until
tender, then drain them and put them in a hot dish at the side of
the stove. Use 1 cup of the stock they cooked in to make a sauce,
with 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 of flour, and plenty of salt and
pepper. Pour the sauce over them to serve.




CREAMED CARROTS AND POTATOES

To 1 quart of cold boiled potatoes, cut in dice, add 1 cup of boiled
diced carrots. Put them in a double boiler and cover with 1 1/2 cups
of highly seasoned white sauce, to which has been added 1 tablespoon
of onion juice and 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley; let boil
up once and serve.




CARROTS SAUTÉ

Use boiled carrots cut in dice or fancy shapes and toss them for
five minutes in hot butter. Season with salt and pepper, add a little
chopped parsley, and serve very hot.

Fancy shaped German carrots in glass bottles can be used instead of
fresh ones.




GLORIFIED CARROTS

Take 2 cups of diced carrots and boil them in slightly sweetened
water about half an hour, or until tender, and let them cool. Put 1
tablespoon of butter into a saucepan, add to it 1 teaspoon of grated
onion, and toss together until hot; then add the diced carrots and 1
cup of well-made white sauce. Butter small individual gratin dishes,
fill them with the carrot mixture, sprinkle the top with a few lightly
browned bread crumbs, then with chopped chives, and set in a hot oven
for five minutes. Serve alone as an entrée, placing each dish on a
small plate with a paper doily.

This dish can be varied by using more chives mixed with the carrots
and omitting the onion, or, if chives are not at hand, they can be
omitted when the onion is used, and finely chopped parsley substituted
to garnish the top.

The quantities given here can be doubled, and the carrots cooked in
a large baking dish as an addition to the main course of a luncheon
or dinner.




GLAZED CARROTS

For this, the carrots must be cut into even cones or ovals, and it
is convenient to use the imported carrots in glass bottles. If these
are used they are already boiled; if fresh carrots are used scrape
and wash them and cut out the little shapes with a patent cutter,
then boil slowly until tender, but not quite done, and put 2 or 3 cups
of them in a frying pan with 2 tablespoons of butter, which has been
melted, sprinkle with fine sugar, and stir over a hot fire until they
begin to brown; then add 2 tablespoons of the stock they boiled in,
continue to stir them, add more stock if needed, and continue stirring
until the carrots are nicely glazed. Serve alone or as a garnish.




CARROTS DELMONICO

Scrape and cut in dice enough carrots to fill a small baking dish;
cover with boiling water in which is 1 tablespoon of sugar, and
1 tablespoon of butter, and let cook for half an hour, or until
tender. Drain and let them cool, and then arrange them in the baking
dish with the following sauce: Melt 3 tablespoons of butter, add 3
tablespoons of flour, and when this is smooth stir into it, using a
little at a time, 1 cup of the stock in which the carrots were cooked,
1/2 cup of cream or milk containing the beaten yolks of 2 eggs;
when smooth add 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice, and salt and pepper
well. Sprinkle the top with finely rolled crumbs and let brown in
the oven.




CARROT SOUFFLÉ

Mix 2 cups of boiled, mashed carrots, 2 tablespoons of chopped onion,
fried for five minutes in 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 cup of milk
or cream in which 3 egg-yolks are beaten, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg,
salt and pepper, and when well blended add lightly with a fork the
stiffly beaten whites of the 3 eggs. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and
bake to brown about fifteen or twenty minutes.




CAULIFLOWER

Leave all the green that looks fresh and palatable on the cauliflower,
and wash it and let it stand from fifteen minutes to half an hour in
salted water. Then put it in a saucepan, stem downwards, with the
top barely covered with boiling water, and, if the saucepan is not
too large, it will keep the cauliflower upright, so that the delicate
top will not cook to pieces before the green stalk is tender. A small
cauliflower will take half an hour to cook, and the lower part can
be tried with a fork to see when it is tender. Leave the saucepan
uncovered in cooking cauliflower, and the odour from the cooking will
be very much lessened and the cauliflower more delicate in taste.




CREAMED CAULIFLOWER

Boil and drain a cauliflower and serve over it 1 cup of white sauce.




CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN

Boil a large cauliflower, drain it, and break the sprays apart. Arrange
in layers in a buttered baking dish, sprinkling each layer with cheese,
and seasoning it with pepper and salt. When the dish is filled pour
on 1 cup of white sauce, sprinkle the top with crumbs and cheese,
and let bake fifteen minutes to brown.




CAULIFLOWER IN A GERMAN WAY

Boil a cauliflower and drain it, dredge with salt and pepper, and
cover the white part with melted butter, and then dust this with
browned bread crumbs; pour 3/4 of a cup of Dutch butter over it,
and let it heat for five minutes in the oven in the shallow gratin
dish in which it should be served.




ITALIAN CAULIFLOWER

Boil and drain a cauliflower and dredge the top with pepper and salt,
sprinkle with grated cheese, and pour a little melted butter over
it. Set in the oven for five minutes to brown, and serve surrounded
with tomato sauce.




CAULIFLOWER FRITTERS

Boil a cauliflower for twenty-five minutes, or until nearly tender,
then drain it and let it cool. When cold separate the sprays and
dredge with salt and pepper, then dip in batter, and fry in deep fat
until a golden brown. Drain and serve very hot.




CREAMED CELERY

Scrape and trim 3 or 4 heads of celery, leaving the roots on
and cutting the tops off; cut each stalk in half, lengthwise,
and into pieces five inches long; wash carefully in running water,
and then blanch in boiling water for ten minutes. Drain and tie the
stalks together like bunches of asparagus, and put them in a saucepan
containing 2 cups of water, 2 cups of milk, 1/2 a carrot, 1/2 an onion
with 2 cloves stuck in it, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 scant saltspoon
of pepper, and let simmer three quarters of an hour or more, or until
quite tender when tried with a fork. Remove the celery, strain the
stock, and use 1 cup of it in making a sauce, with 1 tablespoon of
butter and 1 tablespoon of flour. Untie the bunches of celery, and
arrange them evenly on toast with the sauce poured over them.




CELERY IN BROWN SAUCE

Prepare celery as above, boil for three quarters of an hour or
until tender, drain, and cover with the brown sauce described below,
omitting the wine, and serve in an ordinary vegetable dish.




CELERY IN CASSEROLE

Cut celery in four-inch lengths, halving each stalk lengthwise,
and leaving the root on, wash well and parboil for ten minutes in
salted water or milk, and arrange in a square, covered casserole. Put 2
tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when browned add 2 tablespoons
of flour. Stir until well dissolved, then add 2 cups of the water in
which the celery cooked, 1 scant teaspoon of salt, 1 small saltspoon
of pepper, and 2 bay leaves. Stir until smooth, and then strain and
pour this sauce over the celery, add 1 teaspoon of sherry or Madeira,
cover the dish, set it in a shallow pan containing a little water,
and let it cook for half an hour in the oven. Serve in the casserole.




BAKED CELERY

Cut 2 bunches of celery into two-inch lengths, wash thoroughly, and
let blanch in boiling water and milk, using equal quantities of each,
for fifteen minutes, then remove the celery and let it cool; add to
1 cup of the milk and water stock 1 tablespoon of butter blended with
1 tablespoon of flour, some pepper and salt, and when smoothed remove
from the fire and beat into it vigorously 2 eggs. Arrange the celery
in a buttered baking dish, pour the sauce over it, spread the top
thickly with crumbs, and put in the oven. Cover for twenty minutes,
then uncover and let brown nicely before serving.




CÊPES IN BLACK BUTTER

French Cêpes come in tin or glass. Put 3 tablespoons of butter in
a pan, with 2 bay leaves, a few celery seeds and 1 clove of garlic;
let it slowly brown. Strain and add cêpes and let them heat in the
butter. Season with salt and paprika and serve very hot.




AMERICAN SWEET CORN

Sweet corn on the cob, which has been picked within twenty-four
hours of the time of using, should be dropped into rapidly boiling,
slightly salted water, and boiled not more than eight or ten minutes.




ROAST CORN

To roast sweet corn, leave the husks on the cob, and put in a slow oven
and let bake for half an hour. Take off the husks and silk and serve at
once. Some think this method of cooking the delicate American vegetable
retains the flavour of the corn more than the usual way of boiling it.




CORN PUDDING

Use 6 or 7 ears of sweet corn, and cut each row down the middle with
a sharp knife, and then cut the grains from the ear, and add to them 2
cups of milk, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of
sugar, 1 tablespoon of melted butter, and 2 slightly beaten eggs. Put
this into a baking dish and bake like a custard, in a slow oven for
half an hour, taking care it does not cook too long nor get too hot
lest it curdle. Canned corn may be used when fresh is out of season.




CORN PUDDING IN TOMATO OR PEPPER CASES

Bake the preceding in cases made by scooping a large part of the inside
from large, solid tomatoes, or in hollowed-out green, sweet peppers.




CORN CREOLE

Put 1 can of corn into a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of chopped
green peppers and 1/2 cup of milk, and cook slowly for ten minutes;
then season with salt and pepper and add 1 tablespoon of butter
and serve. This may be put in a baking dish, covered with crumbs,
and baked for fifteen minutes.




CORN AND TOMATO PIE

Butter a pudding dish and fill it with alternate layers of boiled or
canned corn and tomatoes, and season with salt, pepper, and butter;
cover the top with pie-crust and bake in a moderately hot oven for
fifteen minutes. If a crust is not desired the dish can be covered
with bread crumbs and browned. If fresh tomatoes and corn are used
the pie will require twice the time to cook, the first half of the
time covered with a plate, and the last half uncovered.




CORN CHOWDER

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1
sliced onion, and let cook slowly for five minutes; then add to it
4 cups of potatoes which have been parboiled for five minutes, and
then cut in small squares, and 2 cups of boiling water. Let cook for
twenty minutes or until the potatoes are tender, then add 1 can of
sweet corn, 4 cups of hot milk, 1 tablespoon of butter, and plenty
of salt and pepper, and let heat through. Break 8 soda crackers into
a deep dish, and pour the chowder over them to serve.




RHODE ISLAND ESCALLOP

Bake 4 medium-sized sweet potatoes for half an hour, then scrape out
the potato and chop it into small bits. Boil 2 ears of green corn
for ten minutes, run a sharp knife down each row of grains, cutting
them in two, and then cut the corn from the cob and mix it with the
chopped sweet potato. Butter six individual gratin dishes and fill
them with the mixed corn and potato, sprinkle them with salt, pour
1 tablespoon of melted butter over each, cover with bread crumbs,
and let cook for eight or ten minutes in the oven. The same mixture
can be used to fill a baking dish, and enough melted butter used to
moisten the potato thoroughly.




STEWED CUCUMBERS

Peel 4 or 5 cucumbers, quarter them, and cover them with boiling
salted water, and let them cook from twenty to thirty minutes; then
drain, saving the water in which they were cooked. Make a sauce of
2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of flour rubbed together,
and 2 cups of the water in which the cucumbers were boiled, stir until
smooth, and when it boils add the juice of 1 lemon, 1 teaspoon of salt,
and some paprika; arrange the cucumbers on slices of toast and serve
with the sauce poured over them.




STUFFED CUCUMBERS

Peel the cucumbers and cut into pieces about two inches long, scoop out
the centre of each piece about half-way down to form a cup, fill this
with chopped onions and chopped mushrooms that have been fried together
in butter, cover the tops with crumbs, and let brown in the oven.




FRIED EGG-PLANT WITH SAUCE TARTARE

Peel and cut an egg-plant into half-inch slices, dust quickly with salt
and pepper, roll in beaten egg-yolk, then in fine bread crumbs, and fry
in hot vegetable fat; drain on brown paper and serve very hot. Either
serve sauce Tartare with this, or arrange a spoonful on each round of
egg-plant. Garnish with sprigs of watercress, celery tops, or parsley.




FRIED EGG-PLANT WITH TOMATO SAUCE

Fry as in foregoing recipe and serve a savoury tomato sauce with the
egg-plant. Never soak egg-plant in salt and water, as it takes away
its crispness.




CREAMED ENDIVE

Cut the outside leaves from heads of endive, and wash the endive
thoroughly; then drain and put in boiling salted water for fifteen
minutes. Drain again and cover with cold water for a few minutes, then
chop and put in a saucepan with some butter, allowing 1 tablespoon
for each head of endive, cover and let cook slowly for ten minutes,
salt well, moisten with cream and sprinkle with paprika, and serve
on toast or garnished with triangular pieces of toast.




KOHLRABI

These are very nice if used young, when not much larger than an
egg. Parboil them for half an hour, cut them in half, and put them
in a frying pan containing melted butter, and fry for fifteen or
twenty minutes. Serve over them the butter in which they were cooked,
and dredge with salt and pepper. The time required to cook kohlrabi
depends largely of course upon the age at which it is picked.




KOHLRABI AU GRATIN

Slice kohlrabi, boil twenty minutes or until nearly tender, and arrange
in a baking dish in layers with cream sauce. Season each layer with
pepper and salt, sprinkle the top with crumbs and grated cheese,
and bake twenty minutes.




LENTIL PIE

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add to
it 1 finely chopped onion and let this fry slowly for ten minutes;
then add 2 cups of boiled German or Egyptian lentils and 1/2 cup of
brown or German sauce, and when heated through pile into a deep dish;
dredge with pepper and salt, cover with pie-crust, and bake in the
oven until brown.




LENTILS EGYPTIAN STYLE

Wash 2 cups of lentils, soak them two or three hours, and drain them
before using. Put them into boiling water well salted, cook until
tender, about forty minutes, then drain again. Put 2 tablespoons of
butter into a saucepan, and when melted add 1 large onion finely
chopped; cook over a very slow fire for ten minutes, then add the
lentils and 2 scant cups of boiled rice, and stir all together with
a large fork until very hot; dredge well with salt and pepper before
serving.




GERMAN LENTILS

Cover 2 cups of lentils with cold water and let them soak two or three
hours; drain them and put them in boiling salted water with 1 leek
(or 1 onion) and let them cook half an hour, or until tender but not
broken. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when melted
stir into it 2 tablespoons of flour, and let brown; then add 2 finely
chopped onions and 2 or 3 tablespoons of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of
the water in which the lentils cooked. Mix this sauce with the drained
lentils, put them in a double boiler with salt, pepper, and a dash of
nutmeg, and serve after they have steamed slowly for fifteen minutes.




LEEKS

Cut leeks into three-inch lengths, using the tender green part as
well as the white; wash the pieces thoroughly in cold running water,
then put them in a small saucepan and cover them with boiling salted
water, and let them boil for twenty minutes.

Make a sauce by melting 1 tablespoon of butter and thickening it
with 1 tablespoon of flour, and then adding, 1 tablespoon at a time,
enough of the water the leeks were cooked in (about 1 cup) to make
the sauce of the right consistency; season with pepper and salt,
drain the leeks, and serve the sauce over them.




MUSHROOMS

Mushrooms should only be used when perfectly fresh and firm; in
peeling them take a small knife, and, holding the delicate fringe at
the edge of the mushroom between the edge of the knife and the thumb,
peel the paper-like skin off, pulling it toward the centre of the
mushroom. The stems should be cut or broken off without breaking the
cup, and if sound should be scraped and used. When the mushrooms are
white and small and freshly picked they can be quickly washed and
used without peeling.




STEWED MUSHROOMS

Peel about 1 pound of mushrooms, put them in a saucepan with 2
tablespoons of butter, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt,
and 1/4 cup of milk, into which 1 tablespoon of flour has been mixed;
cover and let cook for five or six minutes, then add 1 cup of cream,
stir all well together, replace the cover, and let cook gently for
ten minutes. These mushrooms can also be cooked and served in an
Italian casserole.




GERMAN STEWED MUSHROOMS

Peel 1 pound of mushrooms and put them in a saucepan, sprinkle with the
juice of 1 lemon, add 1 cup of milk, cover, and let simmer gently for
ten minutes. Thicken with 1 heaping teaspoon of flour dissolved in a
little milk, and add 1 tablespoon of butter and a grating of nutmeg,
and let simmer gently for ten minutes more before serving. Instead
of lemon juice and milk a cup of sour cream is often used in Germany,
and is an acceptable substitute.




MUSHROOM AND CHESTNUT RAGOUT

Use an equal quantity of peeled mushrooms and boiled Italian chestnuts,
and heat in a rich brown sauce. Serve, garnished with toast, or in
cases, or use in a deep pie with a top crust of biscuit dough.




MUSHROOMS NEWBURG

Peel 1 pound of mushrooms, cover them with 2 cups of milk, and let
them simmer gently for ten minutes. Lift the mushrooms out with a
strainer, and make a sauce of the milk by adding 1 tablespoon of flour,
1 tablespoon of butter, the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, 1 wineglass of
sherry, and some salt and paprika. When the sauce thickens replace
the mushrooms in it, let them heat for two minutes, and serve on
toast or in patty cases.



BAKED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST

Select as many large mushrooms as are required, and, after peeling
them, lay each one, cup upward, on rounds of toast which, after
toasting, have been dampened by being plunged quickly into hot water;
place the toast with the mushrooms upon it into a shallow buttered
pan, put a little bit of butter in the cup of each mushroom, sprinkle
with salt and pepper, cover with another pan the same size, and let
cook eight or ten minutes. Serve at once, with a garnish of parsley
or watercress.



GRILLED MUSHROOMS

Peel or wash the mushrooms, and put them, cup upward, on a fine wire
broiler and let them broil over a hot fire for five or six minutes,
putting a pinch of salt in each cup. As soon as hot, remove them from
the broiler and serve on hot plates, taking care not to spill the
juice which has formed in the cups. Garnish with watercress or parsley.



MUSHROOMS SUR CLOCHE

Place carefully cleaned mushrooms, cup upward, on individual gratin
dishes, salt each, and place a bit of butter in the cup, and set in a
hot oven for ten minutes. To serve, place over each a glass "bell,"
which can be bought for this purpose. The heat is thus retained in
the mushrooms during service.



MUSHROOMS IN CASSEROLE

Put into a French or Italian casserole 1/2 cup of good butter, and when
melted stir into it 3/4 of a pound, or a pound, of peeled mushrooms,
and dredge well with pepper and salt. Cover the casserole and set it
in the oven; after five minutes' cooking stir the mushrooms, mixing
them well with the butter, replace the cover, and repeat the process
in another five minutes; let cook ten minutes more, and serve from
the casserole on rounds of toast.




FILLED MUSHROOMS

Select 10 of the largest, most cup-shaped from 1 1/2 pounds of
mushrooms. Peel and lay in a shallow pan, cup side up. Take the cleaned
stems and the remaining mushrooms and chop fine and put them in the
cups; add 1 teaspoon of melted butter, some pepper and salt to each,
and let bake ten minutes or until done. Serve on toast garnished with
watercress, or under the glass bells already mentioned.




MUSHROOMS WITH TRUFFLES

Toss truffles in butter in a hot frying pan for five minutes,
sprinkle the cups of mushrooms with pepper and salt, fill them with
the truffles, and cook for ten minutes in a covered pan in a hot oven;
serve on crisp lettuce leaves, with parsley butter.




MUSHROOMS WITH PEAS

Fill the cups of large mushrooms with French canned peas, which
have been tossed for five minutes in hot butter. Season and set in
a covered pan in a hot oven for ten minutes, and serve on toast with
white or brown sauce, as preferred.




MUSHROOMS WITH ONIONS

Peel 2 medium-sized onions and chop them fine, and put them in a
casserole, or saucepan, with 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Let them
cook slowly for ten minutes, then add 1 pound of mushrooms, which have
been carefully washed or peeled, and another tablespoon of butter,
and cover, letting cook for ten minutes. Season well with salt and
pepper and serve very hot.

Mushrooms thus prepared may be put in a deep baking dish, covered
with crust and baked in a pie.




MUSHROOMS WITH EGG

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a porcelain casserole, or in a saucepan,
and when melted put with it 1 pound of peeled or washed mushrooms;
let simmer gently for ten minutes, then add to them 2 hard-boiled
eggs, cut in slices, and half a cup of cream. This recipe also is
available for a deep pie; put in a baking dish, cover with crust,
and bake until slightly browned.




CANNED MUSHROOMS

Drain the mushrooms from 1 can, and cut them in half. Use the liquid
from the can augmented with water, if necessary, to make brown or
German sauce. Put the mushrooms in a saucepan with the sauce, season
with pepper and salt, and serve very hot on toast.

Button mushrooms can also be cooked by simply draining and tossing
in parsley butter until hot; season with salt and pepper and serve
on toast.

Mushrooms cooked in these ways are suitable for filling peppers
or tomatoes. Canned mushrooms can be bought which are put up with
truffles, and add variety to these different dishes.




CANNED MUSHROOMS CZARINA

Open a can of button mushrooms, drain them, and cut the buttons in
half, if very large, and reserve the liquid. Put 1 tablespoon of butter
in a saucepan, and when melted add 1 tablespoon of grated onion, 2 bay
leaves, 2 cloves, 2 peppercorns, and 2 allspice. Let all cook together
slowly for five minutes, then pour on the liquid from the mushrooms,
with enough milk added to make 2 cups, season with salt, and let
simmer for ten minutes; then add 1 tablespoon of flour creamed with 1
tablespoon of butter, let boil up once, and strain. Put the sauce and
the button mushrooms in an Italian casserole, set this in the oven to
heat for five minutes, and serve from the dish on triangles of toast.




MUSHROOM LOAF

Pour good clear, well-strained boiling vegetable stock onto dissolved
vegetable gelatine or arrowroot, using about 1 tablespoon to every
2 cups of liquid. Season well with salt and pepper, and add 1 can
of button mushrooms, halved, when the jelly is somewhat set so that
they will remain in place evenly dispersed. Line a mould with chopped
parsley and slices of pickled walnuts, pour the jelly into it, and
serve, when set, ice-cold, with any savoury cold sauce or pickles. A
few chopped nuts may be added if desired.




STEWED OKRA

Cut the ends off the pods of young okra, boil for one hour in salted
water, then drain and reheat in a saucepan with some melted butter.

The okra can be used as a garnish to boiled rice. Canned okra needs
only to be boiled five minutes, drained, seasoned, and tossed about
in hot butter in a frying pan for two or three minutes before serving.




OKRA AND GRILLED TOMATOES

Cut good firm tomatoes in half, season well and broil, then serve
with a garnish of stewed okra.




STEWED OKRA WITH TOMATO SAUCE

If fresh okra is used prepare as in stewed okra recipe, and if
canned okra is used drain and heat in boiling salted water. Put 1
tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted lift the okra
from the boiling water and place it in the frying pan; season well
with salt and pepper and then cover with 1 cup of tomato sauce, and,
when thoroughly heated through, serve.




OKRA AND TOMATO ESCALLOP

Arrange alternate layers of sliced canned okra and tomato in a well
buttered baking dish, separating them with layers of boiled rice
well seasoned with salt and pepper and dotted with butter. Cover the
top with fine crumbs and cook for fifteen minutes, or until browned,
in the oven.




BOILED ONIONS

Peel onions under cold water and they will not bring tears to the
eyes. They should then be put in rapidly boiling water, and this
changed after the first five minutes of cooking; then put in fresh
boiling water, salt added, and cooked for from half an hour to forty
minutes. If onions are not covered when boiling the odour will be
less noticeable.

Serve boiled onions with parsley butter, or, after draining, cover
with milk, add butter, pepper, and salt, and let boil up once before
serving.




CREAMED ONIONS

Use onions which have been boiled until tender but not broken, and,
after draining, serve with white or parsley sauce, made with equal
quantities of milk and the stock in which the onions cooked.




BOILED ONIONS WITH BROWN SAUCE

Serve small boiled onions, which have cooked until tender, but not
broken, with any hot sauce,--tomato, brown, mushroom, etc.




ONIONS AU GRATIN

Prepare as for creamed onions, making a white sauce of the milk, or
milk and water, in which the onions have been boiled. The onions can
be left whole, or somewhat broken up in the sauce. Fill a buttered
baking dish with onions and sauce, dust the top with grated cheese,
and let heat in the oven five or six minutes. The bottled Parmesan
cheese is convenient, but is never as delicate to the taste as fresh
cheese grated.




ONIONS WITH CHEESE

Arrange boiled onions, which are not broken at all by boiling, in a
buttered baking dish, baste well with melted butter, and dredge with
grated cheese, and set in the oven a few moments to brown; serve in
the same dish or remove to a small platter and garnish with green,
or use as a garnish to a dish of other vegetables. Mashed potatoes
piled high (browned on top with salamander or under flame in gas oven)
surrounded with these onions makes an attractive dish.




ESCALLOPED ONIONS

Escalloped onions are made like Onions au Gratin, except that the
cheese is omitted and replaced by a layer of fine bread crumbs.




BAKED ONIONS WITH CHESTNUTS

Peel as many onions as required and parboil them for ten or fifteen
minutes in salted water. Drain and dry, and when cooled somewhat
remove the inside and fill with chopped chestnuts which have been
tossed in hot butter for fifteen minutes; season well with salt and
pepper, and, if liked, a little sage; arrange in a buttered baking
dish, and bake for half an hour, covering them for the first fifteen
minutes. If they seem too dry, baste with a little cream or onion
stock and melted butter.




ONION SOUFFLÉ

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1
tablespoon of flour, stir until smooth, and then add gradually 1 cup of
milk, and season with paprika and salt. Let boil, then add 1/2 cup of
stale bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, 1 1/2 cups of cold
boiled onions chopped fine, and the yolks of 2 eggs well beaten. Mix
thoroughly, then add the stiffly beaten whites of the 2 eggs, and mix
them gently through the onion mixture with a fork. Put in a buttered
baking dish, or in individual cases, sprinkle fine crumbs on top,
and bake about fifteen minutes to slightly brown before serving.




BORDEAUX ONIONS

Peel 6 or 8 small onions, and parboil them for fifteen minutes
in salted water. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan or a
baking dish, with 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley and 1 tablespoon
of chopped celery, 2 cloves, 1 bay leaf, 1/4 of a cup of claret,
1 cup of brown sauce, the juice of 1 lemon, pepper and salt. Set the
onions in this, cover, and let cook very gently for half an hour or
until tender. Remove the bay leaf and serve with the sauce.




ONION AND TOMATO ESCALLOP

Place alternate layers of fresh onions, sliced, and fresh tomatoes
in a buttered baking dish, covering each layer with crumbs, butter,
pepper and salt. Put 1 1/2 cups of water over and bake for about
an hour in a slow oven. Or use boiled onions and canned tomatoes,
dampen with the juice from the tomatoes, and cook twenty minutes.




ONIONS BEATRICE

Fill a large bean-pot (or a high earthenware covered jar marmite)
with small Bermuda onions, two inches in diameter. The onions should
be left whole, but a sharp knife can be used to make two cuts in
the shape of a cross in the top of each, as this insures the cooking
of the centre. While arranging the onions in the jar, sprinkle them
well with salt, also with black pepper (or use 1/2 dozen peppercorns
instead), put in 3 bay leaves, and distribute 1 teaspoon of mixed
herbs. Cover with hot water, put the lid on, and set on the back of
the stove or in a slow oven. The onions should not cook to pieces,
and with the proper heat will be cooked through in about two hours;
this time is named not as a rule but as a guide. Serve in the marmite
in which they were cooked.




STUFFED ONIONS

Boil the onions fifteen or twenty minutes and then remove the hearts,
leaving the outsides as cases for a filling. Make the stuffing of bread
or cracker crumbs mixed with the chopped centres of the onions, plenty
of salt and pepper, and a little chopped tomato (or tomato sauce), or
some chopped green peppers, or canned pimentos, or use both tomato and
peppers. Fill the onion cases, and arrange in a buttered baking dish;
sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of melted butter, set the pan in water,
and bake half an hour; the baking dish should be covered until the
last five minutes, and the onions should not be allowed to go dry;
more butter can be added, or a little hot water or vegetable broth,
if they cook dry. Serve in the baking dish, or remove to a small
platter and garnish with sprigs of parsley.




FRIED ONIONS

Peel the onions and cut into thin slices, and when a generous
tablespoon of butter has slowly melted in a frying pan, put the
onions in and let them simmer over as low a fire as will keep them
cooking; stir them frequently and serve when transparent and turning
a golden brown.

Fried onions can be served alone or as a garnish to heaped up
mashed potatoes. They are saved from their extreme commonplaceness
by being arranged in a gratin dish, not over an inch high, dusted
with a sprinkling of crumbs or grated cheese, and given three or four
minutes in the oven.




FRENCH FRIED ONIONS

Peel medium-sized onions, and slice crosswise carefully; then separate
the slices into rings. Drop these into smoking vegetable fat or oil,
and let fry four or five minutes until crisp and a rich brown. Lift
with a strainer onto brown paper to drain a moment before serving.




ONIONS IN POTATO CRADLES

Make potato cradles as directed, dredge with salt, and fill with
fried or French-fried onions.




SMALL ONIONS

Peel small, round, pickling onions, parboil them ten minutes, drain,
roll in flour, and fry in deep fat. Serve as a garnish to other
vegetables or in stews.




GLAZED ONIONS

These are nice used either as a garnish to another dish (vegetable
croquettes, mashed potatoes, etc.) or alone. Small onions should
be used, or onion hearts, and taken from the water before they are
quite cooked; then put in an enamelled pan in which is 1 tablespoon
of butter which has been slowly melted; toss them about in this,
and sprinkle with powdered sugar. When they begin to brown add 1
tablespoon of the water in which they were boiled, and as this is
taken up add a little more, and pepper and salt. The onions will be
browned and glazed. Serve very hot.




ONIONS AND APPLES

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted put in
3 sliced onions and 3 sliced apples; let fry slowly until browned,
and serve on toast.




BOILED PARSNIPS IN SAUCE

Wash and scrape 6 or 7 parsnips, cut them in half, lengthwise, and
put them in cold water for half an hour. Drain them, and put them
in a saucepan of boiling water containing 1 teaspoon of salt, and
let them boil for about three quarters of an hour. While they are
finishing cooking, prepare a sauce with 1 tablespoon of butter and
1 tablespoon of flour rubbed together, and put in a saucepan over a
slow fire. When melted and smooth add, a spoonful at a time, some of
the stock in which the parsnips are cooking, until about 2 cups have
been used; stir until well thickened but not paste-like, season with
salt and pepper, and pour over the parsnips after draining them.




PARSNIPS IN BUTTER

Scrape and wash the parsnips, and cut them in eighths, lengthwise,
and then in half. Put them in boiling water, salt well, and let them
cook for about three quarters of an hour. Drain and serve with 1/2
cup melted butter poured over them, which contains 1 tablespoon of
chopped parsley.




FRIED PARSNIPS

Slice cold boiled parsnips lengthwise, dredge with salt, and fry
in buttered pan or griddle until a golden brown, turning with a
pancake turner.




FRENCH FRIED PARSNIPS

Use cold boiled parsnips, cut in any shape desired,--balls, or long
strips,--and put them in a frying basket, and fry in hot fat until
brown. Drain, and dredge with salt to serve.




BROILED PARSNIPS

Use boiled parsnips, cut each in 3 slices, lengthwise, dip in melted
butter, broil until brown, and sprinkle with salt before serving.




GREEN PEAS

Newly picked green peas should be shelled and put in a double-boiler
with a little salt, and 1 teaspoon or more of sugar, and no
water. Cover closely and keep water in under pan boiling for about
three quarters of an hour. Add a little butter before serving.




GREEN PEAS PAYSANNE

Cook peas as in the above recipe adding a few lettuce leaves which
have been washed and cut in strips. Drain them before adding butter
and salt.




CANNED PEAS

Canned peas should be slowly cooked in their own stock for ten minutes,
drained, and seasoned with butter, pepper and salt, and a little milk
or cream added to them.




CANNED PEAS WITH ONION

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1
tablespoon of chopped onion; let simmer for five minutes, then add
1 can of peas, drained of their juice, and 1/4 of a cup of cream or
milk; season well with salt and pepper, and serve after ten minutes'
slow cooking.




STUFFED PEPPERS

Slice the stem-end from sweet peppers, cut out the insides, and fill
with a mixture made of 1 cup of fine crumbs, 1 grated onion, 1/2 cup
of chopped nuts, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 2 tablespoons of melted
butter. Set in a pan containing a little water and melted butter,
and bake from twenty minutes to half an hour, basting occasionally.

Peppers can be parboiled for ten minutes before stuffing, but though
softer they lose their colour to some extent.




PEPPERS STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS

Cut the stem-end from sweet peppers, remove the inside, and fill with
mushrooms Czarina, or mushrooms in tomato sauce, and bake twenty to
thirty minutes, basting with a little butter and water, which should
be in the pan in which they are cooked.




PEPPERS WITH RICE

Cut the stem-end from sweet green peppers, remove the inside, fill
with boiled rice and chopped tomato in equal proportions, and season
well with pepper and salt. A few chopped mushrooms, olives, or boiled
eggs may be added to the filling. Bake from twenty to thirty minutes,
basting with butter and water.




GREEN PEPPERS WITH EGG

Parboil 6 green peppers for five minutes, first having cut off the
stem-end and removed the seeds. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a
frying pan, and when melted add 1 finely chopped onion, and let it
cook slowly for ten minutes; then stir in 3 tablespoons of fine bread
crumbs, and season with salt, pepper, and catsup. Upon removing the
peppers from the boiling water set them up cup-like in a shallow pan,
and put 1 tablespoon of this mixture into each; break into each pepper
1 egg, cover with some more of the prepared crumbs, and bake for ten
minutes if the eggs are liked soft, for fifteen if liked hard. Serve
on toast with 1 1/2 cups of white sauce containing 2 tablespoons of
grated cheese.




PEPPERS WITH CORN

Cut a slice from the end of sweet peppers, remove the inside, and
fill with canned corn, well salted; replace the ends and bake.

Peppers, like tomatoes, may be filled in so many ways that it is
useless to endeavour to enumerate them, for the ingenious cook can
multiply them without end.




ESCALLOP OF PEPPERS AND CORN

Cut enough sweet corn from the cob to make 3 cups. Take 2 or 3 sweet
green peppers and remove the insides, then slice them in very thin
circles and arrange a layer of the corn in a buttered baking dish,
salt it, and then place some rings of the peppers, then another
layer of corn, and so on, until the dish is filled, finishing the
top with peppers. To a cup of cream (or milk) add 1 beaten egg and 2
tablespoons of melted butter; pour this over the whole, and bake for
half an hour in a hot oven. Canned corn may be used, in which case
less cream will be needed.




FRIED PEPPERS

Remove the seeds from 6 sweet green peppers, cut the pods in squares
about half an inch across. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan,
and when melted add 1 sliced onion, and let simmer for two or three
minutes; then put into the pan the cut-up peppers, and fry for ten
minutes. Add 1/2 cup of brown or tomato sauce and serve on toast with
boiled rice, or on flat rice cakes.




CREAMED PIMENTOS

Put the pimentos from 1 can into 2 cups of white sauce, and let cook in
a double boiler for ten minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley,
some pepper and salt, and serve on toast.




ROLLED PIMENTOS

Remove the pimentos from the can, and with a sharp knife cut them
open on one side and open them out. Arrange the flat pieces thus made
on a large plate or board, with the inner part up, and spread with
finely chopped onion, sprinkle with salt and celery salt, and roll
into firm rolls. Place these in a well-buttered tin, add a little hot
water, cover, and set in a hot oven for ten minutes; then uncover,
add 1 tablespoon of butter, and when it melts baste the pimentos with
it. Let them cook five minutes more, and serve with the melted butter
poured over them, or with parsley butter.




PIMENTOS WITH OKRA

Split the pimentos with a sharp knife, salt the inner part, then
roll each around a pod of freshly boiled or canned okra. Place in a
well-buttered pan, add a little hot water, and let cook ten minutes
covered, and five uncovered. Add more butter during the last five
minutes, baste the rolls, and serve with the butter poured over them,
or with tomato sauce.




PIMENTOS WITH TOMATO

Lay the large flat pimentos from a can on a platter, and slide into
each a slice of tomato which has been sprinkled with salt and celery
salt. Fry in a covered pan for five minutes, and serve plain or with
caper sauce.




POTATOES

Between the good cooks who contend that a potato is never properly
"boiled" if it is boiled at all, and those who either cook potatoes
in a steamer, or put them in cold water which is carefully watched to
see that it does not actually boil, cooking thus until the potatoes
are tender, and those who drop them into rapidly boiling salted
water, letting them boil hard until done, there is wide latitude for
individual preference. I would advise those who do not have potatoes
served on the table which are white and floury and thoroughly cooked
through, to see that one of the above-mentioned ways of cooking
potatoes is carried out in their kitchens. Potatoes put in boiling
water, or put in a covered steamer over rapidly boiling water, will
cook in from twenty minutes to half an hour, the time depending, of
course, upon the size and age of the potatoes; they should always be
carefully scrubbed and cooked in their skins, and peeled afterwards.




MASHED POTATOES

Having boiled or steamed the required number of potatoes, peel them as
expeditiously as possible and break them up in a hot saucepan; mash and
then beat them vigorously with a wooden spoon or a fork, add a generous
piece of butter, dredge with salt and a little pepper, and beat them
until they are light; then moisten slightly with a very little hot
milk or cream, beat them for a moment more, and serve very hot.




POTATO SOUFFLÉ

Put into a saucepan 3 or 4 cups of warm mashed potato and 1 tablespoon
butter. Add the yolks of 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons cream (or milk), salt
and pepper, and stir over fire until well mixed. Remove from the fire
and add the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Heap in a buttered baking
dish and let brown on the top in the oven.




MASHED POTATO SOUFFLÉ IN CASES

Select large potatoes, scrub them and let them bake until mealy, which
will be in from half an hour to three quarters, then cut them in half,
lengthwise, and carefully scrape out the potato, laying aside the
skins to use as cases. Mash the potatoes with a wire potato-masher,
add 1 tablespoon of butter for every 5 potatoes used, and season well
with salt and pepper. Beat the whites of eggs very stiff, allowing
2 to every 5 potatoes, and mix them lightly through the potato with
a fork; fill the potato skins with the mixture, heaping them full;
brown them slightly in the oven before serving, and garnish the dish
on which they are served with sprigs of parsley. Five potatoes will
fill 6 or 7 cases.




RICED POTATOES

Break up well-boiled dry potatoes with a fork, dredge with salt and
pepper, and press through a sieve or a so-called "ricer" into a hot
serving dish.




RICED POTATO FRITTERS

Boil 6 large potatoes, press them through a sieve, and add 3 lightly
beaten eggs, 2 teaspoons of flour creamed with 1 tablespoon of butter,
1 teaspoon of salt, and 2 cups of milk. Beat well together, and drop
from a large spoon into deep, hot fat; they will rise to the top a
light brown when done. Chopped chives or chopped parsley may be added
to the mixture if desired.




MASHED POTATOES WITH ONION

To 4 or 5 cups of mashed potato add 1 cup of boiled onion minced to
a pulp, 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 tablespoon of cream, some pepper
and salt; beat lightly together, and before serving brown the top
for a moment in the oven.




BAKED POTATOES

Select potatoes of uniform size, scrub them well, place in a hot oven
until they yield to pressure of the fingers, which will be in most
cases in about three quarters of an hour. They should not stand after
baking, and should be served in an open dish. A baked potato that is
worked with the fingers while being turned in the hand a few times,
becomes light and soft.




ROAST POTATOES

Pare small, round potatoes, and lay them in cold water. Put 2
tablespoons of butter in a shallow baking pan, and let it melt in the
oven; then wipe the potatoes, and lay them in the pan, rolling each
in the hot butter. Let them cook in a moderate oven from one half to
three quarters of an hour, and baste them during the cooking five or
six times with the butter. Sprinkle with salt before serving.




DENVER POTATOES

Peel several smooth oval potatoes and cut in half, lengthwise. Dig
out a small hole in the centre of the smooth side, and level the
rounded parts so they will sit evenly. Put a lump of butter in each,
and place in a pan with a little water, first dredging with salt and
pepper, and bake about twenty-five minutes or until browned.




BROILED POTATOES

Cut cold boiled potatoes lengthwise into quarter-inch slices, dip each
in flour, and lay in a folding broiler. Broil until evenly browned
on both sides, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve on a hot dish
with a bit of butter on each, or as a garnish to other vegetables.




FRIED POTATOES SOUFFLÉ

Peel and trim the required number of potatoes to a uniform size,
cut both ends straight across, and then slice the potatoes into
slices about 1/16 of an inch thick, and drop them into cold water for
about half an hour, and then dry them with a cloth. For the frying
two kettles of fat are necessary, one of which must be perfectly
fresh; drop the potatoes into the used fat or oil and let them fry
until about half done; but do not let them brown at all; drain them
thoroughly and let them get cold. Five or six minutes before they
are to be served drop them into the fresh fat which should be almost
smoking, move them about lightly with a fork, and they will puff out
to a considerable size; let them become a golden brown, put them in
the oven on brown paper for a moment, and serve instantly.




WHOLE POTATOES FRIED

Use very small new potatoes, and, after boiling them, roll in egg and
cracker crumbs, and fry in hot, deep fat. Use alone or as a garnish

little vegetable cutter, which cuts tiny globes of potato, is used
to form the shapes. Some care must be taken to use strength enough
with the cutter to make it cut perfectly round balls.




POTATO STRAWS

Peel 4 or 5 potatoes and then cut them with a patent vegetable cutter
in strings; lay them in very cold water for twenty minutes, drain,
and put in a frying basket, and slowly immerse in hot fat, and let them

POTATO CRADLES

Peel, wash, and dry potatoes of uniform size and shape. Cut in two,
lengthwise, and scoop out the inside, and fry the potato cases in
hot fat until brown; then drain and sprinkle with salt. Serve hot
peas heaped up in each cradle and garnish with mint or parsley.




POTATOES LYONNAISE

Take 5 or 6 cold boiled potatoes and cut them in slices. Put 1
tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when it is melted add 2
thinly sliced, medium-sized onions, and fry these, letting them cook
very slowly ten minutes; then season with pepper and salt and add
the sliced potatoes, and let these fry slowly, turning with a knife
until they are a golden brown; season afresh with pepper and salt,
and add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley before serving. These
potatoes will take a great deal of salt and pepper.

ten minutes. Then add more vegetable stock or boiling water to make a
thin sauce and strain it; return to the fire and add 5 or 6 parboiled
thinly sliced potatoes, 2 tablespoons of capers, and let cook slowly
for fifteen minutes, stirring frequently; then pour into the saucepan
1/2 cup of cream (sour preferred), and serve in a deep, hot dish.

frying pan, place the potatoes and onion in it, and smooth the top
even with a fork. Season well with salt and pepper and put over a
moderately hot fire, shaking the pan vigorously from time to time to
keep the hash from burning. If it is shaken instead of being stirred
it will brown well on the bottom. Turn out onto a hot serving dish,
with the browned part on top, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

in a baking dish or casserole, pour the sauce over them, and on the
top of all pour 1 well-beaten egg. Put the dish in the oven and let it
stay just long enough to set the egg. Sprinkle with chopped parsley
before sending to the table. If preferred the egg can be added to
the white sauce instead of being put on top.




MOCK NEW POTATOES

potato cutter cut them into small balls; drop these in boiling water,
and when done cover with a highly seasoned white sauce, to which is
added a very little chopped parsley.




BOILED SWEET POTATOES

As the skin of sweet potatoes does not come off well after cooking
it is best to peel them before baking or boiling.

Select large sweet potatoes, put them in boiling water, and let them
boil from half to three quarters of an hour. Peel them and arrange
them in a hot dish, with 1/2 cup of melted butter poured over them.




BAKED SWEET POTATOES

and add a little nutmeg; then place another layer of potato, and
another of pastry, and so on, until the dish is nearly filled. Pour
on enough boiling water to almost fill the dish, and cover the top
with pastry like any deep pie, cutting it here and there to let the
steam escape. Bake for about twenty minutes, or until the crust is
a little browned.




MARYLAND SWEET POTATOES

Peel 6 or 8 medium-sized sweet potatoes, quarter them lengthwise,
and lay them in a large saucepan having rounded sides. Add to the
potatoes 2 heaping tablespoons of butter, and 3 heaping tablespoons of
granulated sugar, and 2 or 3 tablespoons of water, and stir until the
sugar and butter are dissolved. Cover closely and let them cook for
four or five minutes undisturbed, then stir again with a wooden spoon,
being careful to see that the syrup is not sticking on the bottom,
re-cover, and from now on let cook only a couple of moments at a time
before again stirring. The water will of course soon cook away; let
the potatoes cook rapidly in the hot syrup until they begin to soften,
then put them where the fire is less hot, and let them cook slowly
until done. The entire cooking should not take more than fifteen
or twenty minutes, and the thick brown sauce should be thoroughly
scraped from the saucepan and served over the sweet potatoes.




CANDIED SWEET POTATOES

Lay pared sweet potatoes cut in slices in a buttered baking dish
with a cover. Sprinkle each layer with brown sugar, salt and pepper
and cinnamon, and dot with bits of butter. Pour in 1/2 cup of boiling

dishes or cases with crumbs on top, and bake ten minutes to brown.




FRIED SALSIFY TARTARE

Use cold boiled salsify, cut in any shape desired, dip in egg and
crumbs, and fry in hot fat until browned. Drain well, dredge with salt,
and serve with sauce Tartare.




SPINACH

Spinach should be well picked over, leaf by leaf, and washed in
several different waters, and changed to a different pan each time it
is washed, that the sand may be left behind with each washing. Then
put it in a large kettle, with a scant cup of water for a peck of
spinach, and let it cook over a slow fire until tender; in this way
its own juices will be extracted, and it will be more tasty than if
cooked in water. It should be then drained and chopped extremely fine,
or until as nearly a pulp as possible, and then mashed in a mortar or
with a potato-masher. It is then ready to prepare in any way desired
for the table.

Delicious spinach can be had canned, and if this is used it needs only
to be very finely chopped and mashed, then seasoned, and prepared in
any of the following ways.




GERMAN SPINACH

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and in it let simmer
for ten minutes 1 good-sized onion that has been finely chopped,
then add 4 cups of the boiled, chopped, and mashed spinach to it,
and stir well together, and season thoroughly with salt and pepper;
finish with 1/2 teaspoon of grated nutmeg, and 1 or 2 tablespoons of
whipped cream, and pile high in a heated dish, covering the top with
the chopped whites and riced yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs.




SPINACH WITH WHITE SAUCE

Prepare as in the above recipe, using, instead of the cream, 1/2 cup
of highly seasoned white sauce, and at the last add the juice of 1
lemon or 1 tablespoon of reduced vinegar.




GERMAN SPINACH WITH RHUBARB

Another German way of preparing spinach is to cook rhubarb leaves or
flowers (or both) with the spinach for the purée and to add chives. If
canned spinach is used the rhubarb leaves should be cooked and chopped
and added to the canned spinach before it is macerated.




ITALIAN SPINACH

Wash 1/2 peck spinach and cook twenty-five minutes without
water. Drain, chop to a fine pulp, mash until smooth in a mortar,
season with 1 tablespoon of butter, salt and pepper, and encircle with
a garnish of well-scrambled eggs to which has been added 2 tablespoons
of grated cheese.




NOVELTY SPINACH

Drain a can of spinach and chop it very fine, and then mash it until
smooth. Put it in a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of chopped chives
or grated onion, salt and pepper, and sprinkle the whole surface
well with grated nutmeg. Hard boil 3 eggs, remove the yolks, and
mix them thoroughly with the spinach. Chop the whites, and arrange
the spinach on rounds of toast, placing 2 tablespoons on each piece,
garnish with the whites of the eggs, and pour on each 2 tablespoons of
cheese sauce. If the arrangement on toast is not desired, the cheese
sauce can be mixed with the spinach before serving it.




SPINACH SOUFFLÉ

Take 2 cups of cooked chopped spinach, mash to a pulp, add 1 cup of
white sauce and the whites of 2 eggs beaten very stiff, season well,
and pile lightly in timbale cups; set these in a pan of water, and let
bake in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes or less. Before serving
sprinkle the top of each with riced yolk of hard-boiled egg.




BAKED SQUASH OR PUMPKIN

Cut a pumpkin or a squash in triangular or square pieces, about three
inches across, scrape the seeds, etc., from each piece, and sprinkle
with salt and pepper, and spread with butter. Set in a moderate oven
and bake for half an hour or until browned. Serve garnished with sprigs
of parsley. It should be eaten from the shell with additional butter.




CALIFORNIA SQUASH

Take a very young summer squash, which if it be young enough need
not be pared, and cut it into small pieces. Fry half an onion in a
tablespoon of butter, and when transparent and beginning to brown
add the squash to it and season with salt and pepper. Let all cook
together for ten minutes, and then add 1/4 of a cup of hot water,
and let cook until the squash is quite tender.




STEWED TOMATOES

Empty 1 can of tomatoes into a double boiler, and put with them 1
cup of crumbled bread without crust, stir well together, season with
pepper and salt, cover, and let cook slowly for half an hour, stirring
from time to time. Just before serving add a piece of butter the size
of a walnut. While the tomatoes will be ready to serve with half an
hour's cooking, they are improved by cooking an hour, and are better
still if warmed again after cooling.




ESCALLOPED TOMATOES

Drain the juice from 1 can of tomatoes. Butter a baking dish, and
cover the bottom with the tomatoes; dot with butter, dredge with
pepper and salt, and sprinkle generously with fine bread crumbs;
arrange another layer of tomatoes, and crumbs, and so proceed until the
dish is filled. Pour over all enough of the juice of the tomatoes to
moisten well, and then finish the dish with a covering of crumbs. Bake
for twenty minutes in a moderate oven.




BREADED TOMATOES

Slice large, solid tomatoes, dredge them on both sides with salt and
pepper, and dip each slice in beaten egg, and then in fine bread or
cracker crumbs. Arrange them in a frying basket, and plunge them in
hot, deep fat for one or two minutes to brown. Drain, and garnish
with sprays of parsley, or use as a garnish to other vegetables.




FRIED TOMATOES

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted lay in
thickly sliced tomatoes which have been rolled in egg and crumbs;
when browned on one side turn them with a pancake turner and brown
the other side, seasoning with pepper and salt. Remove to the serving
dish with a pancake turner, seasoning the first side cooked after
they are turned onto the dish. A half a teaspoon of onion juice may
be added to the butter in which they are cooking if desired. Serve
plain or with white sauce.




DEVILLED TOMATOES

Cut in half and broil three or four nice solid tomatoes, and serve them
with a sauce made as follows: Take the yolks of 4 hard-boiled eggs and
crush them with a fork, add to them a scant teaspoon of dry mustard,
1 heaping saltspoon of salt, and several shakes of paprika, or a dash
of cayenne pepper; mix these dry ingredients well together, and then
add to them 5 tablespoons of melted butter, 2 tablespoons of vinegar
or lemon juice, and heat in a double boiler; when it begins to thicken
remove from the fire and stir in 1 well-beaten egg. Chop the whites of
the boiled eggs, and put with them 2 teaspoons of chopped parsley, and
decorate the centre of each broiled tomato with this before serving.




CREAMED TOMATOES

Take solid, medium-sized tomatoes, and, having cut a circular piece out
of the stem-end, scoop out most of the inside, and fill with parboiled
celery cut in half-inch lengths, mixed with an equal quantity of
canned peas, and dampened with white sauce; heap 1 teaspoon of peas
on the top of each tomato, and bake for twenty minutes or more,
and serve with highly seasoned white sauce poured over each.




BAKED TOMATOES WITH MUSHROOMS

Wash good solid tomatoes and carefully cut out the inside; dredge
with pepper and salt and fill the tomato with sauté mushrooms, using
either fresh or canned ones, chopped and fried in butter. Bake for
about twenty minutes, or until heated through but not broken.




TOMATOES WITH NUT FORCE-MEAT

Slice the stem-end from 6 large, solid tomatoes, scoop out the
inside, and fill with a force-meat made of one cup of crumbs, 1/2
cup of chopped nuts, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1
tablespoon of melted butter, 1/2 tablespoon of grated onion, and 1
egg. Replace the tops on the tomatoes and bake them for about twenty
minutes, watching that the skins do not break, as they will do in a
too hot oven.




TOMATOES STUFFED WITH EGG AND PEPPERS

Cut the inside from solid, large tomatoes, and refill with a mixture of
equal parts of chopped hard-boiled eggs and chopped sweet green peppers
(or use pimentos) well moistened with melted butter and onion juice,
and seasoned with salt. Put in a baking dish, cover, and let bake
for twenty minutes in a moderate oven.




BAKED TOMATOES WITH GREEN PEPPERS

Scoop out the inside from solid tomatoes, and refill with the tomato
meat which has been cut out of the centre and chopped with sweet green
peppers, using 1 teaspoon of peppers to each tomato, and 1 teaspoon
of cracker crumbs or boiled rice; season with pepper and salt, and
place 1/4 teaspoon of butter in each tomato before laying the top on;
then bake in a moderate oven about twenty minutes.




TOMATOES FILLED WITH EGG

Select very large solid tomatoes, and with a small, sharp knife cut a
round piece out of the stem-end, then cut out a large enough space from
the inside to hold a small egg, and arrange in a shallow pan. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper, add 1/2 teaspoon of grated onion, and set in a
hot oven for five or six minutes. Remove, and break into each tomato
the yolk of 1 egg and as much of the white as it will hold without
running over the edge. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a little chopped
parsley, and replace in the oven, letting them cook slowly fifteen
minutes until the egg is set. Remove to individual plates for serving,
taking care to not break the tomato. Garnish with cress or parsley.

Tomatoes may be stuffed in a great variety of ways,--with fillings
of fried cucumber, tomato, and chopped onions, or bread dressing with
sage, etc.




TOMATOES STUFFED WITH SPINACH

Cut an opening in the top of large, solid tomatoes, and scoop out some
of the inside with a spoon, fill with "German spinach," and place in a
hot oven for about twenty minutes; upon removing from the oven cover
each with a slice of hard-boiled egg, or use the white rim filled
with riced yolks. Serve alone or as a garnish for another vegetable.




TOMATOES STUFFED WITH MACARONI

Scoop the inside from 6 large, solid tomatoes and use it with 1 bay
leaf and some melted butter to make a tomato sauce. Into this stir
1/2 cup of boiled macaroni (spaghetti or rice may also be used),
and, after seasoning well with salt and pepper, fill the tomatoes
with the macaroni, putting 1 teaspoon of grated cheese on the top
of each. Bake in a moderate oven for about twenty minutes or less,
and garnish with watercress or parsley.




AMERICAN RAREBIT

Put a little water and 1 large tablespoon of butter in a frying pan,
and when melted add 1 large Spanish onion or 3 ordinary onions chopped
fine, and let simmer slowly ten minutes. Strain the juice from a can
of tomatoes, and put the tomatoes in a double boiler; when they are
heated through scrape the onions into the tomatoes, and let them all
cook together for half an hour; season highly with salt and pepper,
and just before serving add 2 or 3 well-beaten eggs, and let stand for
a few minutes until somewhat thickened; serve on toast. If the flavour
of onions is liked, a larger quantity of chopped onion may be used;
and to increase the quantity, 3 or 4 more eggs may be added to this
rule without other changes. For chafing-dish prepare in advance to
the point where the eggs are added, and add these after reheating in
the chafing-dish.




TOMATOES AND ONION

Proceed as in the preceding recipe without adding the eggs.




TOMATOES CASINO

Select large, solid tomatoes, and without cutting them let them
boil for fifteen minutes; then slip off the skins, halve them,
and lay each piece, cut-side down, on a round of toast the same
size as the tomato. Cover the top with warm Hollandaise, Bernaise,
or Maître d'hôtel sauce, and in the centre lay a slice of truffle;
garnish with watercress.




TOMATOES INDIENNE

Halve large, solid tomatoes, and arrange them in a shallow pan,
cut-side up. Dredge with salt and pepper, and spread with curry powder
and some onion juice. Put in the oven for ten minutes, or under the
gas burners of the oven in a gas stove. Do not let the tomatoes soften,
and serve at once to prevent this. Use alone or as a garnish to rice.




TOMATOES WITH EGGS

Strain 1 can of tomatoes and put them in a saucepan; stir well, and
season with pepper and salt and 1 tablespoon of butter, and, after
they have cooked fifteen or twenty minutes, stir in 3 or 4 well-beaten
eggs and serve on toast after two or three minutes' further cooking.




CURRIED TOMATOES

Cut a thin slice from the stem-end of large, solid tomatoes, and
scoop out some of the inside. Fill with boiled rice to which is added
the tomato removed from the inside and a little curry powder (1/2
teaspoon to 1 cup of rice is a moderate amount). Season the mixture
well with salt, replace the top, and bake fifteen minutes. The curry
powder can be omitted from the filling and the tomatoes served with
curry sauce if preferred.




SAVOURY TOMATOES

Cut in half rather large, solid tomatoes, allowing 2 halves for each
person to be served, and set them, cut-side up, in a shallow tin;
press capers into the spaces, then dredge heavily with celery salt,
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and set under the flame of a gas oven
until the tops are blackened. The flame should be hot so that this
may happen as quickly as possible in order that the tomatoes may
not become softened by the heat; to this end it is also necessary to
leave the door of the broiling compartment open.




TOMATOES CREOLE

Cut in half, crosswise, 5 or 6 solid tomatoes, and set them, cut halves
upwards, in a buttered pan. Chop 1 or 2 sweet green peppers, mix with
them 1 teaspoon of chopped onion, and sprinkle this over the tomatoes;
place a small piece of butter on each half, and sprinkle with salt
and paprika. Let bake about twenty minutes, then remove to rounds of
toast, or nests of boiled rice, and pour over them white sauce.




TOMATO LOAF

Strain the juice from 1 can of tomatoes through a sieve fine enough to
stop all the seeds, and put in an enamelled saucepan to boil; season
well with salt and pepper, and when it boils pour it onto enough
gelatine dissolved in water to stiffen it. The amount of gelatine
cannot be given, as the various vegetable gelatines, arrowroot, etc.,
vary in thickening power. Instructions as to the proper amount for each
pint of liquid will come with every package. Set the jelly aside to
cool, and arrange slices of hard-boiled egg on the bottom of custard
cups or small plain moulds, and encircle these with slices of stuffed
olive, pickled walnut, or truffles, or mushrooms. When the jelly is
somewhat cooled, and so thick enough to hold down these garnishings
when poured onto them, half fill the cups with it. Serve when set
and ice-cold, turned out on lettuce leaves.




TOMATOES AND HOMINY

Take 2 cups of cold boiled hominy and 2 cups of boiled tomatoes,
put them in a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of butter, season generously
with salt and pepper, and serve in a deep dish when thoroughly heated
through, or put into a buttered baking dish with crumbs on the top
(and a little grated cheese if liked); brown before serving.




STEWED TURNIPS

Peel and wash turnips and cut them in eighths lengthwise, or in dice,
and put them in boiling milk and water which covers them. Let them
cook slowly for half an hour uncovered, then lift them out and place
on a hot dish at the side of the stove. Make a sauce with 1 1/2 cups
of the stock in which they cooked, into which beat the yolk of 1 egg
and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice; season this with pepper and salt and
pour over the turnips. Instead of this, ordinary white sauce may be
made of the turnip stock.




MASHED TURNIPS

Peel and quarter 2 good-sized turnips, cover them with boiling
water, and let cook until tender, which should be in from half an
hour to three quarters; drain them in a colander, and press gently
with a wire potato-masher to remove as much water as possible, then
mash them and beat them well, stirring in 2 tablespoons of butter,
1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 saltspoon of pepper.




MASHED TURNIPS AND POTATO

Prepare turnips as for mashed turnips, and mash with them an equal
quantity of boiled potatoes; add butter, pepper, and salt, and beat
up very light before serving.




TURNIPS AU GRATIN

Cut boiled turnips in thin slices, and arrange them in a buttered
baking dish in layers one inch deep; sprinkle each layer with melted
butter, pepper, salt, and grated cheese. Finish with cheese on the top,
and bake for twenty minutes.




RAGOUT OF TURNIPS

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1
tablespoon of chopped onion and 4 cups of diced turnips, and stir until
they begin to brown; season with 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of
pepper, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and add slowly 1 cup of vegetable broth
or milk into which 1 tablespoon of flour has been made smooth. Let
simmer gently for half an hour.




TELTOWER RÜBCHEN

Buy the imported "rübchen," which are the daintiest tiny turnips, and
heat them in their own liquor; then drain and serve with Spanish sauce.




PARISIAN TURNIPS

Cut turnips into small rounds with a Parisian potato cutter, and boil
them for half an hour or until tender, the time depending largely
upon the age of the turnips. Drain, and cover with highly seasoned
white sauce, to which 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley has been added.








    Kindness to animals is not mere sentiment but a requisite of
    even a very ordinary education; nothing in arithmetic or
    grammar is so important for a child to learn as humaneness.

VEGETABLE COMBINATIONS


CHOP SUEY

Put 1 cup of onions, fried until brown, 1 cup of celery cut in
two-inch pieces and then shredded and stewed in vegetable stock for
half an hour, 1 cup of fried mushrooms, and 2 cups of boiled rice in
a saucepan with a cup of thin brown sauce. Let all heat together for
ten minutes, and season with salt and pepper.




COLCANNON

This is made by the mixture of two or more vegetables already
boiled. Use equal parts of mashed potato and sprouts (or any greens)
finely minced, and grated onion if wanted, and add some mashed carrots
or turnips or both; season with salt and pepper. Mix 2 eggs through
4 or 5 cups of vegetables, press into a mould, and boil or steam for
half an hour. Turn out to serve, and serve plain or with a brown sauce.




MACEDOINE OF VEGETABLES

Boil 1 small cauliflower and set it aside to drain; then boil 2
cups of diced carrots, drain them when tender, but reserve the
stock. Add to the carrots the cauliflower carefully separated into
little pieces, 2 cups of boiled peas, or 1 can, 1 cup of cooked or
canned flageolets, 1/2 a cup of carrot stock, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt,
1 small saltspoon of pepper, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let simmer
together until heated, and then add 1 chopped onion, 2 bay leaves,
1 tablespoon of butter. If liked, a sauce made of 1 tablespoon of
butter and 1 tablespoon of flour thinned with the carrot stock and
highly seasoned can be strained over the vegetables before serving.




CANNED MACEDOINE OF VEGETABLES

Delicious combinations of peas, shaped carrots, flageolets, etc.,
can be had in bottles. Drain them, and put in a saucepan with 1
tablespoon of butter and some pepper and salt. When hot serve or add
1/2 cup of cream. Serve to garnish, or alone, or use to fill peppers,
or tomatoes, or patties.




VEGETABLE CHOWDER

Pare and slice in rather thick slices, enough potatoes to make 4 cups,
and prepare the same amount of shredded cabbage, and sliced onions. Put
2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add the onions,
and cook them for ten minutes. Butter a large casserole, arrange over
the bottom a layer of sliced potato, then a layer of cabbage, then
one of onions, seasoning each with pepper and salt, and sprinkling
with chopped hard-boiled egg, and so fill the dish. Pour 2 cups of
milk, into which 1 tablespoon of flour has been made smooth, over
the chowder, set the dish in a shallow pan of water, and bake slowly
for one hour. If the milk cooks away add a little more during the
cooking. The same dish can be made in a kettle, in which case halve
the potatoes and cook for three quarters of an hour.




VEGETABLE PIE (ST. GEORGE'S HOUSE)

Boil enough carrots, turnips, and large white haricot beans to make
a 1/2 cup of each when chopped or sliced after cooling, and enough
potatoes to make a scant cup when sliced. Slice enough Bermuda onions
to make 1/2 cup, and fry in butter until golden brown; then mix the
onions and prepared vegetables, and add to them 1/4 cup each of canned
peas, green beans, and tomatoes. Season well with salt and pepper,
stir in 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, dampen with the water in which
the haricot beans cooked, heap into a deep baking dish, cover with
a good crust, and bake until slightly browned.




VEGETABLE HASH

Chop separately 5 medium-sized potatoes, 2 sweet green peppers
(carefully seeded), 5 fresh tomatoes, 1 cup of boiled beets (1/2 a
can), and 2 raw onions.

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add
the chopped onions, and let simmer slowly for five minutes, then
add the tomatoes and let simmer another five minutes, then put in
the potatoes, the peppers, and the beets. Dredge well with salt and
pepper, and, stirring occasionally, let all cook slowly until the
juices are nearly absorbed; then let the hash brown on the bottom,
and turn out with the brown on top. Garnish with squares of toast.




VEGETABLE STEW

Put 4 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan, and when melted add
to it 1/2 cup of sliced onions, 1/2 cup of diced carrots, 1 cup of
shredded celery, and 1/4 cup of turnips cut in oblong pieces, and
toss them in the butter for fifteen minutes; then pour over them 6
cups of cold vegetable broth or water, add 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 bay
leaves, 6 small onions halved, 4 carrots cut in quarters, 6 small
squares of turnip, and let simmer slowly for half an hour; then add
5 potatoes cut in half, and let cook for half an hour more, and add
more vegetable broth to keep the vegetables covered. Make dumplings,
and drop into the boiling stew, cover tightly, and cook ten minutes
more; season well with salt and pepper, and serve with enough of the
stock, thickened with a little flour and butter, to cover.




VEGETABLE CASSEROLE

In order that this dish should taste and appear at its best, it
should be cooked and served in an Italian casserole dish from eight
to ten inches in diameter. Peel 8 medium-sized onions, and take the
layers off until a centre about three quarters of an inch in diameter
is left; toss the centres in hot butter until browned, and chop the
outside. Cut 3 medium-sized sweet green peppers in half, lengthwise,
and fill each half liberally with a mixture of bread crumbs, chopped
tomato, chopped onion, and salt and pepper. Stuff 6 solid, medium-sized
tomatoes in any of the ways described under stuffed tomatoes. Put
2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add to it 2
tablespoons of chopped onions; fry these for ten minutes, then stir
in 2 tablespoons of flour, and use vegetable stock or milk, 2 cups
of either, to make a sauce; add 1 bay leaf, and enough soup-browning
to make a rich colour. Put the stuffed peppers in a casserole dish
with the glazed onion hearts and the sauce, cover, and let cook for
ten minutes; then arrange the stuffed tomatoes in the casserole,
distribute among them 1/2 can of button mushrooms, halved, 1/2 can
of flageolets or peas, and leave the cover off the dish, letting it
cook for fifteen minutes very slowly. This casserole can be varied
in many ways, using different filling for the peppers and tomatoes,
and either truffles, string beans, or fresh mushrooms in the sauce,
which should not be too thick.




VEGETABLE RAGOUT

Prepare for boiling what will make 3 cups of turnip when cut in inch
squares, 1 1/2 cups of potatoes, and 1 1/2 cups of carrots. Put the
carrots into slightly salted and sweetened water, let boil for ten
minutes, then add the turnips and potato, and cook for ten minutes
more. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add
2 tablespoons of chopped onion, and fry until slightly browned; then
add 2 tablespoons of flour, stir until smooth, and pour slowly into
this 2 cups of the stock in which the vegetables cooked; then add 2
teaspoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper; and
the diced vegetables; cover, and let simmer slowly for half an hour,
then add 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, and serve.




BORDEAUX PIE

Slice enough Spanish onions to fill a cup 1/4 full, and fry them in
butter until slightly browned. Boil carrots to equal 1/2 cup when
diced, potatoes enough to fill a cup 3/4 full, and peel 2 cups of
mushrooms, and toss them in a little butter in a frying pan over a
moderate fire for ten minutes; hard boil 4 eggs, and make 1 cup of
white sauce. Cut the vegetables in small pieces, slice the eggs,
add 1/4 cup of canned peas (or fresh boiled ones), 1 teaspoon of
chopped parsley, salt and pepper well, put in a little grated nutmeg
and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and mix all carefully with the white
sauce. Line a large baking dish (or small individual ones) with thin
crust, fill with the mixture, cover the top with crust, and bake
until slightly browned.




NEW ORLEANS STEW

Slice 3 onions, and fry them in 1 large tablespoon of butter for five
minutes; then add to them 3 chopped sweet green peppers, stir well,
and let cook together another five minutes; then scrape the contents
of the frying pan into a double boiler, add the corn cut from 3 ears
of sweet corn (or 1/2 can of corn), and 3 sliced tomatoes, 1 cup
of water, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and let all cook
together for one hour; season afresh before serving.




INDIAN CURRY

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and add to it when
melted 2 onions chopped fine, and let cook very slowly for fifteen
minutes. Mix 1 tablespoon of curry powder, 1 tablespoon of sour apple,
or tamarind-chutney chopped fine, 1 teaspoon of salt, and enough
vegetable stock to make a paste. When the onions are browned add this
paste, and after stirring well put in 1 cup of boiled haricot beans,
1 cup of halved boiled chestnuts, and 1 can of halved button mushrooms,
and let all simmer together for ten minutes. Have ready some stock made
by putting 2 tablespoons of desiccated cocoanut into a bowl and pouring
over it 1 cup of boiling water, and use this to dampen the cooking
vegetables; then add 1 cup of vegetable broth, and let cook ten minutes
more. We westerners are fond of this served in this way with chutney,
but in India they press it through a strainer and serve it as a purée,
adding to it 2 well-beaten eggs. Encircle with rice in serving.




CURRY OF LENTILS

Soak 2 or 3 cups of German or Egyptian lentils for two or three hours;
drain them, and put them in boiling water, and let them cook for
three quarters of an hour or until tender but not broken. Salt well
when they have been cooking a short time, and when done drain them,
sprinkle with salt, and heap in a pyramid on a round flat dish;
garnish with 3 hard-boiled eggs cut in half, encircle with boiled
rice, and pour curry sauce over the lentils only. Serve extra sauce
in a sauce-boat and Indian chutney.




CURRY OF SUCCOTASH

Heat 1 can of Lima beans and 1 can of sweet corn, and when hot drain,
and heap on a flat dish; cover with curry sauce, and serve with potato
croquettes and Indian chutney.




CREOLE CURRY

Boil 1 cup of rice, and while it is cooking put 2 cups of okra,
2 cups of tomato, and 2 small onions cut in halves, and 1 teaspoon
of butter in a double boiler, and when hot add 1 cup of hot water,
into which has been dissolved 1 heaping teaspoon of curry powder,
and let all cook together for half an hour; remove the onions, add
the rice, season generously with salt, and serve with Indian chutney.




VARIOUS VEGETABLE CURRIES

Almost any vegetable makes a good curry,--flageolets, carrots and peas,
button mushrooms, etc., and either boiled rice or rice croquettes
should be served. A garnish of Spanish pimentos looks well, and the
curry sauce should be plentiful. Hard-boiled eggs halved are always
nice with curry, and Indian chutney should be served with it.

    Charles Wagner says, 'Can that which comes from Life return to
    Chaos?--Can a work of God have an end?'"








NUT DISHES


ITALIAN CHESTNUTS

Chestnuts can be cooked either by roasting or by boiling. If roasted,
the thin brown that clings to the nut is removed with the outer
shell; if boiled, the inner skin often has to be removed with some
trouble. Roast chestnuts by putting them in a hot oven for eight or
ten minutes, then use a small, sharp knife and peel them from the
point down.

To boil chestnuts put them, in their shells, in cold water and let
them cook for five or six minutes after the water starts boiling, or
put them in boiling water for ten or twelve minutes. Peel carefully,
and serve after roasting or boiling with brown sauce or mushroom sauce,
plain or in cases.




CHESTNUT PURÉE

Roast or boil 6 cups of Italian chestnuts, remove the shell and inner
skin and chop them fine or put them through a vegetable mill. Put
them in a double boiler with milk enough to cover them and let them
cook slowly for fifteen or twenty minutes, or until the milk is all
absorbed. Stir frequently, add 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 tablespoon
of cream, plenty of salt and a little pepper. The purée should be
the consistency of mashed potato.




PEANUT PURÉE

Shell 3 or 4 cups of peanuts, remove the inner skin, and put through a
vegetable mill. Put in a double boiler with milk to cover them, season
with salt, and let cook gently half an hour, or until tender. Stir
frequently, and serve when the milk is absorbed and the peanut purée
is the consistency of mashed potato. A tablespoon of whipped cream
is an improvement if added during the last moments of cooking.




MICHAELMAS LOAF

Mix 1 cup of finely ground walnuts (or other nuts), 1 cup of finely
ground roasted peanuts, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper,
2 1/2 cups of fine bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon of mixed sweet herbs
(thyme, sage, and summer savory), and 1 large onion or 2 small ones
chopped fine. When well blended bind together with 2 eggs which have
been slightly beaten, mould with the hands into a loaf, place in
a well buttered roasting tin, and let it cook for ten minutes in a
moderately hot oven; then add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 cup of hot
water, and baste frequently during half an hour's cooking. The loaf
should be well browned and carefully removed to a hot platter. Make a
brown sauce in the pan in which the loaf cooked, and serve with this
and cold apple sauce.




CHRISTMAS LOAF

Make as in foregoing recipe, omitting the chopped onion and adding
another half tablespoon (or even more) of the sweet herbs. Serve with
cranberry sauce.




ROAST NUT AND BARLEY LOAF

Make a brown sauce with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1/2 cup of browned
flour, and use water or vegetable stock for thinning; chop 1 large
onion fine, and fry it in 1 tablespoon of oil or butter, and mix the
onion and the sauce with 2 cups of cold boiled pearl barley, 1 cup of
finely ground roasted peanuts, 1 cup of fine bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon
of salt, and 1 saltspoon of pepper. With the hands mould into a loaf,
place in a roasting pan which has been well buttered, and let cook in
the oven for ten minutes; then add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 cup
of hot water, and baste every five minutes for half an hour. Make
a brown sauce in the same pan, or serve with Caper sauce. Garnish,
if brown sauce is used, with English savoury croquettes.




STEAMED NUT AND BARLEY LOAF

Make as in the foregoing recipe, but pack into a mould, set this
in boiling water, and let it steam for an hour and a half or two
hours. Let cool in the mould, and turn out to serve cold, or to slice,
or to use for nut hash.

A brick-shaped mould will be made by any tinsmith to order, or the
large sizes of baking-powder tins can be used to steam loaf.




ROASTED NUT LOAF WITH HOMINY

Grind 2 cups of nuts,--pecans, walnuts, roasted peanuts, etc., or
use peanuts only,--and mix with them 2 cups of cold boiled hominy,
1/2 cup of bread crumbs, 3 hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, 1 tablespoon
of chopped parsley, 1 tablespoon of grated onion, and 1 raw egg. Form
into 1 large roll, or several smaller ones, put in a buttered tin,
and let bake in a quick oven for half an hour; baste with a little
butter and water a few times. Garnish with slices of lemon, and serve
with brown sauce. This loaf may be steamed as directed for barley
loaf and used hot, cold, or in hash.




NUT AND FRUIT LOAF

Chop mixed nuts enough to make 2 cups, and add to them 6 bananas
chopped fine and 1/2 teaspoon of salt; mix well together, and press
into a plain mould. Stand the mould in a steamer, and let it steam
for three hours. Serve ice-cold, sliced, with pickles or catsup.




FOUNDATION LOAF

This loaf can be made and kept in readiness for use, as it will
remain fresh for several days if it is left in the covered mould in
which it cooked and is kept in a cool place. Put 2 cups of water in
a saucepan, and when the water boils stir into it 1 cup of a finely
ground cereal, preferably gluten flour or meal, or Scotch oatmeal,
and stir until thick; then add 2 teaspoons of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of
pepper, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 1 cup of shelled peanuts which
have been put through a vegetable grinder twice. Pack the mixture
into a loaf-shaped mould, or large round tin with a tight-fitting lid,
almost immerse it in water, and let it steam for two hours. Use when
cold, either for nut hash or croquettes, or with an equal amount of
bread crumbs and the seasoning to make Michaelmas or Christmas loaf.




NUT HASH

Use cold steamed nut loaf and the same amount of cold boiled
potatoes. Chop the potatoes and the loaf separately, and add to them,
after mixing, 1/4 as much chopped onion. Turn into a frying pan which
contains melted butter well covering the bottom, dredge with salt and
pepper, and stir frequently with a knife during the first ten minutes'
slow cooking; then let the hash brown on the bottom, shaking the pan
vigorously from time to time, season afresh, and turn out with the
browned portion on top. One or 2 chopped green peppers can be added
to the hash, if the flavour is liked.

RICE, MACARONI, Etc.


BOILED RICE

Wash 1 cup of rice by letting water run through it in a sieve, and
put it in a large double boiler, the top of which contains plenty
of water at boiling point; add 1 teaspoon of salt, and let it boil,
tightly covered, for twenty-five minutes; pour off the water then
from the rice, still holding the cover on, and again place it over
the boiler, and let the rice steam for another twenty minutes, when
it will be found that each grain is separate, as it should be. Use
a fork to scrape it lightly into the serving dish.




BAKED RICE

Let 1/2 cup of rice soak for several hours in 2 cups of warm
water. Drain and put in a baking dish, and cover with 3 cups of milk

the top with bread crumbs, pour over all 2 tablespoons of melted
butter, moisten with 1/2 cup of milk, and bake slowly for twenty
minutes.




RICE AND CHEESE

Butter a baking dish well, and sprinkle a half-inch layer of boiled
rice on the bottom; season with salt and pepper, and dot well with
butter; then arrange a generous layer of grated cheese, and sprinkle
this with English mustard mixed with water, then add another layer
of rice, and so continue until the dish is well filled, having the
rice on top. Pour over all 1/2 cup of milk, or of the water in which
the rice boiled, and let cook slowly in the oven for twenty minutes.




BAKED RICE AND TOMATOES

Butter a baking dish well, and put a layer of rice in the bottom of
it, and over this arrange slices of tomatoes; dot well with butter,

1/4 of a cup of milk, 1/3 of a cup of cold boiled rice, 1 tablespoon
of melted butter, some salt and pepper, and finally the stiff whites
of the eggs. Put in a buttered omelet pan, and proceed as in making
the usual omelet, cooking over a slow fire and shaking the pan
vigorously. Sprinkle with salt and a little paprika; when set, turn
together; serve with a sauce if desired, and garnish with watercress.




RICE CZARINA

Butter a baking dish, and put an inch-deep layer of boiled rice
in the bottom. Over this sprinkle finely chopped fresh or canned
tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and dot well with butter; then
place another layer of rice somewhat thinner, and over this spread
finely chopped green peppers, and so alternate tomatoes, peppers,

minutes; then add 1 sour apple chopped fine (or, if it can be had,
1 tablespoon of tamarind chutney), stir for three or four minutes,
then add 1/2 cup of strong vegetable stock or water, and let cook
gently for five minutes; pour on another 1/2 cup of vegetable stock
and 1 cup of milk, into which 1 dessert spoon of curry powder has
been stirred until smooth; let all boil up once, then press through
a sieve, pressing well to get the juices, return to the fire, and to
thicken, use 1 tablespoon of flour blended with 1 tablespoon of butter
to every cup of liquid. Stir until the consistency of thick cream,
and add a little salt before serving. The quantity of curry powder
here named will make a mild curry sauce.




CAPER SAUCE

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1
tablespoon of flour and stir until smooth. Now add, a little at a time,
2 cups of vegetable broth, and stir until it boils and is smooth. Put
in 2 heaping tablespoons of capers and 1 chopped hard-boiled egg,
and season well with salt and pepper. One tablespoon of cream may be
added at the last to enrich the sauce if desired.




CHEESE SAUCE

Make 1 cup of highly seasoned white sauce, and add to it 1 scant cup
of grated cheese; stir in a double boiler until the cheese is melted,

add 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, 2 tablespoons of vinegar,
1 tablespoon of walnut or mushroom catsup, 1 tablespoon of English
mustard, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of black pepper, and a
little cayenne. Thicken with 1 tablespoon of flour, and when smooth
add enough vegetable stock to make the consistency of cream. The
sauce may be used as it is or pressed through a sieve to strain.




EGG SAUCE

To 1 cup of well-made white sauce add 2 hard-boiled eggs chopped fine,
and 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, and a little salt and paprika.




FRENCH SAUCE

Rub together 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 of butter, and put in a
saucepan; as it melts add slowly 1 cup of boiling water or vegetable
stock, let boil, stirring constantly, then remove from the fire,
and when somewhat cooled add the juice of 1 lemon, 2 tablespoons of
tarragon or chervil vinegar, 2 egg-yolks slightly beaten, and salt
and pepper.

egg, chopped fine, and 1 tablespoon of minced parsley before serving.




HERB SAUCES

Make a good white sauce and to each 2 cups of sauce add the herbs
selected, prepared as follows: Take a handful of the leaves, and after
washing them well put them in a pan with a little salted boiling water;
let cook for five minutes, then drain, and dry with a cloth, and put
in a mortar with 1 tablespoon of butter, and macerate until fine;
add this to the white sauce. In this way parsley, mint, tarragon,
chervil, and other herb sauces can be made.




SAUCE HOLLANDAISE

To 1 tablespoon of reduced vinegar add the yolks of 4 eggs mixed
with 2 tablespoons of cold water; stir well together, and cook by
holding above a very slow fire, in order to prevent curdling; add 2
tablespoons of butter, stirring it in a little at a time until all
is used. Season with salt and pepper and serve warm or cold.




HORSE-RADISH SAUCE

Rub together 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 of flour and put in a
saucepan. When melted and smooth from stirring, add slowly 1 1/2
cups of heated milk; when properly thickened by slow cooking, put in
3 tablespoons of grated horse-radish, stir well, season with salt,
add 1 teaspoon of butter, and serve on croquettes, etc.




MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL SAUCE

This is made by using sauce Hollandaise and adding to it 1 tablespoon
of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley.

sort. Remove the shells, blanch in boiling water to remove the inner
skin, and chop them very fine. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying
pan, and when melted add to it 1 tablespoon of chopped onion, and let
cook for five minutes; then add 1/2 cup of chopped nuts and stir until
brown, scrape the contents of the pan into a mortar, and pound them
well. Blend 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 tablespoon of butter, put in
a saucepan, and when melted and smooth add 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 of
the nuts; let cook slowly two or three minutes, add another 1/2 cup
of milk and the remaining nuts. Salt well, and add a little pepper;
let cook very slowly, and when the sauce is the proper thickness stir
in 1 tablespoon of thick cream.

The sauce can be darkened with brown colouring, or by browning the
thickening flour in butter.




ONION SAUCE

Chop 4 onions very fine and brown them in 3 tablespoons of butter;
add 1 tablespoon of flour, let this brown also, and thin with 1 cup
of broth or water or milk. Add pepper and salt, and beat 1 egg-yolk
into it before serving. Serve either strained or unstrained.




PARSLEY BUTTER

Put butter in a saucepan, and when melted add finely chopped parsley
and some salt, using 1 teaspoon of parsley to every tablespoon of
butter used. Serve on boiled potatoes, asparagus, etc.




PARSLEY SAUCE

Into 2 cups of white sauce stir 1 beaten egg and 2 tablespoons of
finely chopped parsley.




SAUCE PROVENÇAL

of chopped shallots or onions, and let cook slowly until only 1
tablespoon remains; add to this 1 cup of Spanish sauce, and when at
boiling point put in the sauce 2 teaspoons of minced sour pickles,
1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, and some salt and pepper; serve with
croquettes or vegetables.




SAUCE RAVIGOTE

Ravigote is merely the name applied to the mixture of herbs combined
with flavouring for this sauce. These are chives, cress, burnet and
chervil, in equal proportions. Use 2 tablespoons of the mixed herbs,
scald them in tarragon vinegar, drain them, chop them fine, and add
them to 1 cup of plain mayonnaise.




SAUCE ROBERT

This is made by adding to 1 cup of Spanish sauce 2 tablespoons of
white wine, 1 teaspoon of onion juice, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of mustard
mixed with 2 teaspoons tarragon vinegar. Season, and make hot in a
double boiler, letting all cook slowly together ten minutes.




SPANISH SAUCE

This is a rich sauce which is used as a basis for many sauces, and
can be made at a leisure time and used any time within a few days. Any
stock in which vegetables have been cooked may be used, but the best
one is made as follows: Wash 4 or 5 cups of red beans or lentils,
and after soaking them in 2 quarts of water for ten hours or more
empty them with the same water into a saucepan, and put with them
3 onions halved, 3 sprigs of parsley, 1 cup of carrots quartered,
1/2 cup of diced turnips, 1 tablespoon of salt, 2 stalks of celery
cut in short lengths, and a small bag containing 1 teaspoon of thyme,
2 bay leaves, 6 cloves, 6 whole peppers, and 1 teaspoon of allspice
berries. Let boil hard for one minute, then set on the stove where
it will simmer slowly for two hours. Strain the broth through a fine
sieve, and use the vegetables in a stew, a deep pie, or a curry. To
finish the Spanish sauce put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan,
and when melted stir into it 2 tablespoons of flour and let brown,
stirring constantly; then add a little stock at a time until about
2 cups have been used and the sauce is the consistency of thick
cream. Darken with 1 teaspoon of brown colouring, add 1 tablespoon
of sherry, and pepper and salt.




SPINACH SAUCE

Put 1 cup of freshly cooked or canned spinach, from which the juice
has been pressed, into a basin or mortar, and chop or mash to a
pulp. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, add to it 1 small
onion chopped fine, let cook slowly for five minutes, then add the
spinach, and let cook for ten minutes more. Put 1 cup of milk into a
double boiler with 1 bay leaf, 1 stalk of celery (or some celery seed),
and when it boils add 1 tablespoon of flour blended with 1 tablespoon
of butter; season with salt and pepper, and when thickened stir the
spinach into this, sprinkle with grated nutmeg, and let cook together
for ten minutes. Press through a sieve before serving.




SAUCE TARTARE

Make a plain mayonnaise sauce (see Salads), and to each cup add 1
teaspoon of gherkins and 2 teaspoons of capers, both very finely
minced; sprinkle a little cayenne on the sauce before serving.




TOMATO SAUCE

Use 6 fresh tomatoes, and after washing them slice them, skins and
all. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 2
tablespoons of finely chopped onion, let cook slowly for five minutes,
then put with them the tomatoes, 2 bay leaves, 1 clove of garlic,
1 teaspoon of sugar, some pepper and salt, and let cook gently for
fifteen minutes; then strain, pressing through a sieve, and return the
liquid to the fire to simmer until reduced to the proper consistency.




TOMATO SAUCE WITH OTHER VEGETABLES

Make tomato sauce, using with it chopped celery, chopped peppers,
or chopped mushrooms, which have been fried for ten minutes in hot
butter and added after the sauce is strained.




TOMATO SAUCE WITH NUTS

Chop 2 tablespoons of blanched nuts, fry them for ten minutes in 1
tablespoon of melted butter, and add these to strained tomato sauce.




TOMATO SAUCE WITH EGG

To each cup of strained tomato sauce add 2 hard-boiled eggs chopped
fine.




SAUCE VINAIGRETTE

To each cup of French dressing add 1 tablespoon of minced onion and
1 tablespoon of macerated parsley.




WHITE SAUCE

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and as soon as it is
melted stir into it slowly 3 tablespoons of flour, using 1 tablespoon
at a time, then add slowly 2 cups of warm vegetable stock or milk,
stirring all the while; then add 2/3 of a teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon
of pepper, and cook slowly for five minutes, stirring constantly;
add 1 tablespoon of butter, and stir for another minute. Some flour
thickens more than others, and if the sauce seems too thick, thin
with a little cream or milk.

White sauce may be varied in many ways by using onion juice, mushroom
catsup, chopped chives, etc.

The white sauce may be made in a double boiler. Put the milk in the
top receptacle, and when boiling add the flour dissolved in a little
cold milk, then the butter, etc., and let cook ten minutes or until
thickened.








    Some people are not to be persuaded to taste of any creatures
    they have daily seen and been acquainted with whilst they were
    alive.--In this behaviour, methinks there appears something
    like a consciousness of guilt; it looks as if they endeavoured
    to save themselves from the imputation of a crime (which they
    know sticks somewhere) by removing the cause of it as far as
    they can from themselves.

EGGS


BOILED EGGS

Eggs are very palatable when put in boiling water and cooked for
three or three and a half minutes, but some cooks recommend that
"boiled eggs" should never boil, but instead, be placed in a large
saucepan which is filled with water that has boiled and just been
removed from the fire. The instructions are to cover the saucepan
closely after putting the eggs in the water, and let it stand on the
back of the stove, the eggs to be removed in ten minutes if wanted
soft, and in twenty minutes if liked well set. Hard-boiled eggs are
certainly more palatable cooked in this way than when boiled for ten
minutes in the ordinary way.




FRIED EGGS

Put a little butter into a small frying pan, and when melted break
an egg into a saucer, and slide it carefully into the hot butter,
and let it fry until the white is thoroughly set, cooking as many as
are required, separately, in the same way. If a tight cover is put
over the frying pan when the egg is put in, the yolk of the egg will
be as pink as a nicely poached egg when done. Season with pepper and
salt before serving. A little Worcestershire sauce or walnut catsup
heated in the pan and poured over fried eggs adds variety.




POACHED EGGS

Fill a deep frying pan 2/3 full of hot water, and stir into it one
teaspoon of vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt. When the water reaches
boiling point break the eggs carefully one by one into it, remove the
pan from the intense heat, cover it, and let the eggs cook until the
whites are firmly set. If the water is shallow the eggs will spread
and be more flat, in which case the boiling water must be dipped up
over the yolks with a spoon to make them pink; if the water is deep
the eggs will be more round than flat. When the eggs are done lift
them carefully from the water with a perforated strainer in order to
drain off the water thoroughly, and serve them on hot toast.




POACHED EGGS WITH GRAVY

Poach eggs and serve them with Sauce Bernaise, or any piquant sauce.




POACHED EGGS INDIENNE

Poach the number of eggs required, and after placing them on toast
pour over them a thin curry sauce.




EGGS WALDORF

Place nicely poached eggs on toast, and fit a freshly cooked mushroom
as a cap over each yolk. Surround the toast with brown sauce containing
quartered mushrooms.




SCRAMBLED EGGS

Break six or more into a bowl, beat them lightly with a fork, and
pour them into a frying pan into which 1 tablespoon of butter has been
melted; stir continually over a very slow fire until they are well set,
seasoning them meanwhile with pepper and salt, and adding another
1/2 tablespoon of butter in small pieces during the cooking. Serve
with a garnish of small triangular pieces of toast. One tablespoon of
cream can be added to the eggs before serving if desired. Eggs may
be scrambled with milk, using 1/2 cup of milk to 4 eggs, and then
proceeding as above.




SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH CHEESE

Make plain scrambled eggs, and when nearly set add 2 tablespoons
of grated cheese for every 6 eggs used, and 1 tablespoon of chopped
parsley. Serve on toast.




SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH MUSHROOMS, PEAS, ETC.

Scramble 6 eggs, and two or three minutes before removing from the
fire add to them a can of button mushrooms cut in slices, lengthwise,
and 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley. In the same way peas,
tomatoes, asparagus tips, chopped sweet peppers, etc., can be used.




SAVOURY SCRAMBLED EGGS

Prepare plain scrambled eggs, and just before taking off the fire add
2 tablespoons of chopped chives (or green stems of young onions or
shallots can be used instead), and 1/2 a tablespoon of finely chopped
parsley; serve on hot toast.




SCRAMBLED EGGS INDIENNE

Make plain scrambled eggs, and just before serving stir into them 1
tablespoon of cream, into which has been stirred 1 teaspoon of curry
powder and 1/2 teaspoon of onion juice. Serve on hot toast.




SPANISH EGGS

For 6 eggs use 1 large tomato and 1 small onion. Chop the onion fine,
and fry it five minutes in 1 tablespoon of butter; then add the
chopped tomato, and stir another minute over the fire. Now pour in
the eggs and scramble them, adding 1 teaspoon of salt and a saltspoon
of pepper. Garnish with small triangles of toast.




SHIRRED EGGS

Butter individual gratin dishes, and break into them 1 or 2 eggs as
desired. Season with salt and pepper, and a sprinkling of finely
chopped parsley, and put into the oven for five minutes, or until
the eggs are set. Place each dish on a small plate with a paper doily.




SHIRRED EGGS WITH TOMATOES

Use as many shallow, individual gratin dishes as there are persons
to be served, and, after buttering each dish, break into it 1 egg,
taking care not to break the yolk. Halve some small tomatoes, and
set one half, cut side up, in each dish; season the whole with pepper
and salt, and set in the oven for ten minutes or less.




GRIDDLED EGGS

Heat a griddle and butter it slightly, and break upon it 3 or 4 eggs,
disturbing the yolks so as to break them. When a little browned on
one side turn them with a cake-turner and fry the other side.




PLAIN OMELET

Put 3 or 4 eggs in a bowl and beat them ten or twelve times with a
fork vigorously. Put 1 scant tablespoon of butter in a frying pan,
and as soon as melted turn in the eggs and shake over a slow fire
until they are set; season with salt and pepper, turn the omelet
together as it is let to slide from the pan, and place on a hot
dish. Make several small omelets rather than one large one, and place
on white paper doilies, and garnish with parsley to serve. The trick
of shaking an omelet is the secret of making a good one, and the egg
mixture should be not over 1/2 an inch deep in the pan.




OMELET SOUFFLÉ

Take 4 to 6 fresh eggs, separate the yolks and whites, and beat each
until as light as possible. Butter a deep frying pan, mix the yolks and
whites lightly together with a fork, and put in the hot frying pan,
smoothing somewhat with a fork to level. Season the top with pepper
and salt, and shake over a slow fire until the omelet is delicately
browned on the bottom; turn it together and serve on a hot platter.




HERB OMELET

Make like plain omelet, stirring with every 4 eggs used 1 teaspoon
each of powdered thyme, or sweet marjoram, sage, chopped onion tops
or chives, and parsley.




CHEESE OMELET

For omelet soufflé made with 6 eggs add 1/4 cup of grated cheese
to the yolks of the eggs, and 1/4 cup to the beaten whites before
putting them together.

In making plain omelet with cheese add 1/4 cup of cheese to 4 eggs
after they are in the omelet pan. Sprinkle with grated cheese to serve,
and garnish with watercress or parsley.




RUM OMELET

Make an omelet soufflé, put on a hot dish, and pour 1/2 cup of heated
rum around it, and light it with a match. Rum is easily made to blaze
if a teaspoon is filled with it and a lighted match held under the
tip of the spoon. The rum on the platter can then be easily lighted
with that in the spoon.




BAKED OMELET SOUFFLÉ

Beat the whites of 6 eggs very stiff and the yolks of 3. Mix the whites
and the yolks, using a fork; then stir in the juice of half a lemon
and 3 tablespoons of powdered sugar. Heap in a buttered baking dish,
and cook in a hot oven about fifteen minutes.




EGGS CARMELITE

Prepare 1 cup of very finely chopped boiled spinach by adding to it 1
teaspoon of butter and 1 saltspoon of grated nutmeg, and put where it
will keep warm. Hard boil 6 or 8 eggs, then cut each carefully in two,
lengthwise; remove the yolks and stir them into the spinach, mashing
them well, and mashing all together until the yolks are thoroughly
mixed with the spinach; then season with salt and pepper and neatly
fill the halves of the whites of the eggs with the spinach. Make a
sauce with 2 cups of milk, 1 teaspoon of butter, and 2 tablespoons of
flour, a dash of paprika, and 1 cup of grated cheese. When this has
thickened arrange 2 or 3 halved eggs in each individual gratin dish,
and pour around them some of the sauce, and set in the oven five
minutes to make thoroughly hot, or serve on a large dish garnished
with small triangular pieces of toast.




EGG WITH MASHED POTATO

Use a long, narrow gratin dish, and arrange cold mashed potato in
it in ridges with a spoon, and make three or four hollows in the
surface. Into each of these break an egg, and let all bake in the oven
until the eggs are set. Tomato or white sauce can be served with this.




EGGS NEWBURG

Hard boil 6 eggs, plunge them into cold water for a moment,
then peel, and when cooled, so they will not crumble in cutting,
cut them in half. Have ready a sauce made of 1 cup of cream (or
milk) and 3 tablespoons of butter, to which when hot is added 2
tablespoons of sherry, 2 tablespoons of brandy (the latter may be
omitted), 1 saltspoon of pepper, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Let cook
three minutes, then beat in vigorously the beaten yolks of 4 eggs,
stir until thickened, add a dash of paprika, and serve over the
hard-boiled eggs on toast.




EGGS LYONNAISE

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1
finely chopped onion, and let simmer slowly for eight or ten minutes;
then add 1 tablespoon of flour, and stir well until smooth. Add to
this 1/2 cup of milk, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 saltspoon of
pepper, and let cook three or four minutes only. Pour into a deep
gratin dish, and break upon it 6 eggs; sprinkle with 1/2 cup of bread
crumbs, and let cook in a moderate oven about five minutes, or until
the eggs are set. Serve in the same dish.




DEVILLED EGGS

Hard boil the number of eggs required, halve them, and serve on toast
with devilled sauce.




JAPANESE EGGS

Hard boil the number of eggs required, and, after halving them,
remove the yolks, and mix them with a little butter (using 1
tablespoon to 6 eggs), pepper, salt, and a little tomato chutney or
Harvey sauce. Refill the halved whites with this, and use the eggs
to garnish 2 cups of boiled rice. Pour over all 1 cup of white sauce
or parsley sauce to serve.




GOLDEN ROD EGGS

Hard boil 5 eggs, take off the shell, and separate the yolks from
the whites, chopping the whites fine and pressing the yolks through
a sieve, keeping whites and yolks separate. Put 1 cup of milk in a
double boiler, and when it boils add to it 1 tablespoon of butter and
1 tablespoon of cornstarch which have been rubbed together, and when
the sauce has thickened season it generously with pepper and salt,
and stir into it the chopped whites of the eggs. While the sauce is
cooking prepare 5 rounds of toast, and place them on a hot dish. Cover
each piece of toast with a layer of white sauce, sprinkle this with a
layer of the yolks, then more of the white sauce, and the remainder
of the yolks, season with salt and pepper, and stand in the oven a
moment or two before serving.




FROTHED EGGS

Separate the yolks and whites of as many eggs as are required, putting
each yolk in its shell or in a separate dish. Beat the whites until
very stiff, and fill a well-buttered custard cup half full of the
white of egg; make a hole in the centre, sprinkle with salt, pepper,
and lemon juice, and drop a yolk in each cup. Put in a shallow pan
of boiling water with a cover on it, and when the eggs are set turn
out onto buttered toast. Garnish with parsley butter.




FRIED STUFFED EGGS

Hard boil 6 eggs and halve them carefully, removing the yolks. Put the
yolks through a sieve, and rub to a paste with 1 tablespoon of melted
butter, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup of cream or milk, using a little
at a time, so as not to use it all unless needed to make the mixture
of the right consistency for refilling the halved whites. Carefully
fill the places made vacant by the removed yolks, roll the half-egg
in beaten egg and crumbs, and fry in deep, hot fat. Serve with 2 cups
of white sauce, and add to it 2 tablespoons of diced pickled beets,
which makes the sauce pink.

This same effect may be had to some extent by simply using hard-boiled
eggs, frying them, and serving with same sauce or white sauce, to
which 1 tablespoon of capers has been added.




SWISS EGG TOAST

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter on a shallow or flat dish, and sprinkle
over it 1 1/2 tablespoons of grated cheese; then break into the butter
3 eggs, taking care not to break the yolks. Sprinkle well with salt and
pepper and 1 1/2 tablespoons of grated cheese mixed with 2 teaspoons of
finely chopped parsley. Bake in the oven until the eggs are set, then
cut each egg out round with a cutter, and serve on rounds of toast.




EGGS CAROLINA

To serve four persons hard boil 6 eggs, then put them in cold water
for one minute, peel 2 of them, chop the whites, and mix with melted
butter and 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, and form into nests on 4
pieces of hot "corn bread." Then peel the other 4 eggs, and arrange
one on end in each nest. Pour a little parsley butter on each, and
season with salt and pepper.




MÜNCHNER EGGS

Hard boil 6 eggs, then peel them, and put each on a leaf of lettuce
or cabbage, encircling it with grated horse-radish, and serve with
a sauce made of vinegar to which is added salt and dry mustard.




EGGS IN MARINADE

Hard boil the eggs required, then remove the shells, and stick 4 cloves
in each egg. Put 2 cups of vinegar on to boil, and rub together a
little vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of mustard, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and
1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and stir into the boiling vinegar. Place the
eggs in a glass jar, and pour the boiled vinegar over them. They can
be used in a fortnight, halved or sliced as a garnish or in salads.




EGGS PARISIENNE

Butter as many timbale moulds as are required, and dust the inside
with chopped parsley; then break into each an egg, and sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Set the moulds in water in a shallow pan, and
place in the oven until well set or hard. Turn out onto a flat dish,
or on individual dishes, and with them serve bread sauce, or any
sauce desired.




EGGS PERIGORD

Butter small moulds or cups, then sprinkle them with chopped parsley,
and on the bottom (which will be the top when they are turned out)
place a symmetrical pattern made of cut beets and truffles or pickled
walnuts. Drop one egg into each mould, dredge with salt and pepper,
and set the moulds in a pan of boiling water; cover, and let cook until
firm. Turn out onto rounds of toast, and serve with a hot tomato sauce,
or any savoury sauce.




EGGS WITH CHEESE

Into a shallow round or oval gratin dish, or small individual dishes,
put melted butter to cover the bottom, and encircle the outer edge
with thinly sliced, rather dry, cheese; inside this break enough
eggs to cover the bottom of the dish, taking care not to break the
yolks. Season with salt and pepper, and put into the oven until the
whites of the eggs are thoroughly set.




EGGS MORNAY

Drop eggs into a buttered baking dish, and then cover them with
a highly seasoned white sauce to which some egg-yolks have been
added (using 1 yolk to each 1/2 cup of sauce), also salt and
paprika. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese, and put in the oven to
bake until the egg is firmly set.




CREAMED EGGS

Butter a shallow dish, pour into it 1 scant cup of milk, and let
heat. When hot cover the surface with eggs, cover, and let poach on
top of stove until set; sprinkle with celery salt, and then cover
with cream, and set in the oven for five minutes. Sprinkle the top
with finely chopped celery tops to serve. This may be cooked in one
large dish or in individual gratin dishes.




EGGS OMAR PASHA

Butter individual gratin dishes, and break 2 eggs into each, taking
care not to break the yolks. Slice small onions so the separate rings
are unbroken, and place a circle of these rings on the eggs around
the edge of the dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then with grated
cheese, and bake in a slow oven until the eggs are thoroughly set.




TURKISH EGGS

Butter one large gratin dish or several small ones, break into them
enough eggs to cover the bottom, taking care not to break the yolks;
put them in a moderate oven until the whites are quite set, and then
garnish by putting a few tablespoons of boiled rice on the eggs around
the edge of the dish, alternating with button mushrooms, which have
been cut in thin slices and mixed with brown sauce. Season with salt
and pepper just before serving.




EGGS BEURRE-NOIR

These are best served in individual gratin dishes measuring about
four inches across. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and
let it cook over a slow fire until a rich brown, but not burnt. Add
to it 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and cover the bottom of each gratin
dish with the (black) butter; then break into each dish 1 egg, or 2
if required, taking care not to break the yolk. Season with salt and
pepper and arrange 8 or 10 capers on each; put in the oven eight or
ten minutes, or until the eggs are well set. Set each dish on a doily
on a small plate before serving, with a sprig of parsley on the side.




EGGS CREOLE

Take a shallow gratin dish large enough to contain the eggs required,
allowing 2 eggs to each person, butter the gratin dish, and break the
eggs carefully into it, taking care not to break the yolks; season
with pepper and salt, and set in a moderate oven until the whites
are stiff; while they are cooking prepare the following garnish which
will be sufficient for 6 or 8 eggs. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a
saucepan; when melted add 1 onion cut into thin slices, and stir it
about three or four minutes. Then add to it 1 tomato which has been
peeled and chopped, 1 sweet green pepper cut in very thin slices,
each broken in several pieces, and 1/2 can of button mushrooms,
which are prepared by draining and washing and cutting lengthwise in
3 or 4 pieces. Let all cook slowly together for eight or ten minutes,
stirring carefully and adding more butter if necessary. When nearly
cooked season generously with pepper and salt, add 1 tablespoon of
tomato sauce, and when the eggs are removed from the oven place this
garnish on the eggs, encircling the outer edge. This garnish can be
varied as to quantities to suit taste, using more or less tomatoes
or onions. This is very nice done in individual gratin dishes, 2 eggs
being used in each dish.




EGGS IN SAVOURY BUTTER

Savoury butter is made by melting good butter, and adding to it any
chopped herb,--chives, parsley, etc. Put a little of this in individual
gratin dishes, and break into them 1 or 2 eggs as desired. Pour a
little of the savoury butter over the top of each egg, season with
salt and pepper, and put in the oven until the eggs are thoroughly
set. If fresh tarragon is available, two nicely shaped leaves crossed
on the yolk of the egg make a pretty garnish, or two leaves of lemon
verbena may be used instead.




EGG MOULD FOR VEGETABLES

Make egg mixture as for egg timbales, and pour into a buttered ring
mould. Cook in pan of water in the oven twenty minutes or until set,
and then turn out onto a hot, round, flat dish, and fill the centre
with hot button mushrooms which are mixed with tomato sauce, or with
peas, either with or without the sauce.




CANUCK EGG TOAST

Sprinkle fresh toast with walnut, mushroom, or any savoury catsup,
then heap on it nicely scrambled eggs in which milk has been used,
and on top put a generous layer of grated cheese; season with pepper
and salt, and put under the oven flame of a gas stove. Let the cheese
brown, then remove and garnish the top with slices cut from black
pickled walnuts, or a few capers, or with thin strips of pimentos,
or chopped chives.




ESCALLOPED EGGS

Hard boil 8 eggs, cut the whites into medium-sized pieces, and press
the yolks through a sieve or ricer. Put 1 cup of milk in a double
boiler, and with it 1 tablespoon of finely minced onion, shallot,
or chives. When the milk boils add to it 1 tablespoon of thickening
flour dissolved in a little milk and stir until thickened. Season
with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, a dash of paprika,
and stir in the riced egg-yolks and the diced whites. Serve in small
dishes, or covered with crumbs and browned in the oven, or on rounds
of toast. One or 2 sweet green peppers finely chopped vary this dish.

CHEESE


CHEESE RAMEKINS

Take 1 cup of bread crumbs and 1 cup of milk, and cook together until
smooth; then add 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 1 scant teaspoon
of mustard, and 6 tablespoons of grated cheese. Stir over the fire
for one minute, then remove, and add salt and cayenne pepper, and
the lightly beaten yolks of 2 eggs; afterwards stir in with a fork
the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Pour into ramekin
dishes, and bake for fifteen minutes in a moderate oven, or cook and
serve in a baking dish.




BAKED CHEESE AND BREAD

Soak 1 cup of bread crumbs for two or three minutes in 2 cups of
milk, then beat in the yolks of 2 eggs thoroughly beaten, and 1 cup
of grated cheese, and lastly the whites of the 2 eggs beaten to a
stiff froth. Put into a buttered baking dish, dot the top with butter,
sprinkle with bread crumbs, and bake until a light brown, which will
be in from twenty minutes to half an hour.




CHEESE FONDU

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1 cup
of milk, or cream if desired, 1 cup of fine bread crumbs, 2 cups of
grated cheese, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard,
and some cayenne pepper. Stir constantly until well heated through,
and then add 2 lightly beaten eggs, and serve on rounds of toast.




CHEESE RELISH

Put 1 cup of milk into a double boiler, season with pepper and salt,
and when hot stir in 1 cup of grated cheese, and let cook for five
minutes; then add 3 crumbed soda crackers and serve on toast, with
a sprinkling of paprika.




CHEESE MÉRINGUES

Beat the whites of 2 eggs to a stiff froth, and stir into them with a
fork 2 tablespoons of Parmesan or grated cheese, 2 drops of tabasco,
a little salt and paprika; drop 1 tablespoon at a time into hot fat,
and fry until brown; then drain and sprinkle with fresh salt and
paprika before serving.




CREAMED CHEESE

Make 2 cups of well-seasoned white sauce, add a few drops of golden
yellow colouring, stir into it 1/2 cup of cheese cut into dice (or
grated if preferred), and when the cheese is softened and hot serve
on rounds of toast and sprinkle with paprika.




CHEESE PANCAKES

Make small pancakes of 1 cup of milk, 1 egg, and enough flour to
thicken, and spread them with grated cheese moistened with a little
melted butter; sprinkle chopped chives mixed with parsley over the
cheese, and a dash of any savoury catsup (if liked), season with salt
and pepper, roll the pancakes after cooking, and serve as a savoury
or luncheon dish.




COTTAGE CHEESE

Take 2 quarts or more of sour milk or cream, and add to it the same
quantity of rapidly boiling water, turn into a straining-bag, and
hang up until dry. When ready to use, turn out of the bag and rub
until smooth; add a seasoning of salt and pepper and a little sweet
cream. Beat until light and serve ice-cold. A little cream can be
served to eat upon it, if liked.

This can also be made by heating the sour milk or cream and using no
water, but the milk must only be heated enough to separate and not
enough to boil.




WELSH RAREBIT

Cut in very small thin pieces 1 pound of American cheese; put it in
a chafing-dish and stir until melted, then add 1 teaspoon of mustard,
some salt, and slowly stir in 1/2 a glass of beer or ale, and season
with cayenne or paprika just before serving on toast.




BACHELOR'S RAREBIT

Make Welsh rarebit, and five minutes before serving stir into it
1 tablespoon of chopped green peppers and 1 tablespoon of chopped
Spanish pimentos.




DELMONICO RAREBIT

Cut in small pieces 1 pound of American cheese, put it in a
chafing-dish and stir until melted; then add 1/2 a glass of beer or
ale, some salt and cayenne or paprika, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, the
yolk of 1 egg, then the whipped white of the egg, and serve at once
on toast. The white of the egg militates against any "stringiness"
which is apt to come from cooking certain sorts of cheese. A little
milk can be used, if desired, instead of beer.




PINK RAREBIT

Drain 1 can of tomatoes and put them in a saucepan with 1 tablespoon
of butter; season them well with pepper and salt, and after they have
cooked fifteen or twenty minutes add 1 pound of fresh American cheese
cut into thin slices, and stir until melted; season generously with
salt and pepper, and serve on rounds of toast.




LIPTAUER CHEESE

Remove the paper from the smallest Neufchâtel cream cheese, which is
nearer like real Liptauer than any other that can be had in America,
and set it in the centre of a plate; surround it with 1 teaspoon of
paprika, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, a small mustard spoon of French mustard,
a piece of fresh butter half the size of the cheese, 2 teaspoons
of minced onion, and 1 teaspoon of capers. The "Liptauer" should
be blended at the table with a silver knife. Add first the butter,
then the capers, then the onion, then the seasoning, and make into
a cream. Serve on brown or white bread, or crackers.




ROQUEFORT CHEESE GOURMET

Cream 1/2 pound of Roquefort cheese with 1 tablespoon of butter and
some salt and 1 tablespoon of sherry, and serve on water crackers.




CAMEMBERT CHEESE

A pretty way to serve Camembert cheese is to place the cheese, when
removed from its box and paper, on a round paper doily on a large
plate, and surround it with a heavy wreath of watercress and radishes
cut to look like flowers.




CHEESE "DREAMS"

Cut fresh cheese into thin slices, spread with made mustard, sprinkle
with paprika, lay between two trimmed slices of bread, and toast on
both sides until nicely browned, using a very slow fire.




GRATED CHEESE

Instead of throwing away bits of dried cheese these should be grated
and put in a wide mouthed, covered glass jar.








   "If Plutarch's advice, that those who affirm that they were
    intended by nature for a diet of flesh food, 'should
    themselves kill what they wish to eat,' were always followed,
    the question would to most take on a different aspect. Few
    can endure unmoved the horrible sights of the slaughter-house;
    far less could they participate in the slaughter."








SALADS


There is no end to the combinations of vegetables for salads; the
few here given are the best ones I have tried. The dressing should
never be put on a fresh green salad until just as it is to be used;
other salads, like potato, beans, etc., are sometimes improved
by standing. Lettuce for salads should be carefully looked over;
and clean, inner leaves not washed unless they are muddy; but all
the leaves used which are washed should be thoroughly dried before
adding the dressing. In France the salad basket is one of the most
used kitchen utensils, and the salad leaves after washing are shaken
in this until absolutely dry. The dressing should be very well mixed
with the vegetables, and a little dry salt and pepper added as the
salad is served.




FRENCH DRESSING

An absolute rule for making good salad dressing is an almost impossible
thing, as this seems to be the one place in cookery where it is not
only allowable but commendable to "guess" at proper proportions. The
following is as nearly accurate as it seems well to be. Put 1 scant
teaspoon of salt and 1 saltspoon of black pepper in a bowl, and stir
into them with a wooden fork, very slowly, 3 or 4 tablespoons of fresh
oil, and then add half as much or less vinegar, mixing it well with
the oil.




TARRAGON VINEGAR

Good tarragon vinegar can be bought in any city, but it is so easily
prepared at home that it is worth doing. Put a handful of tarragon
in a quart jar, and cover with cold or heated vinegar. Seal the jar
and set it in a dark place for a month or so before using.

Make chervil vinegar in the same way.




PLAIN MAYONNAISE DRESSING

Put 2 chilled egg-yolks in a cold soup plate, and stir into them 1
teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of mustard, using a silvered spoon,
and after these are well mixed in begin to add oil, actually drop by
drop, from 1 scant cup of cool olive oil, and do this until the eggs
are so thickened that it is not possible to make them more so; then the
remaining oil may be added less slowly. If this first process is not
properly done, no amount of stirring will ever thicken the sauce. A
fork or whisk may be used to finish the stirring. When the oil is
added, beat in slowly 1 tablespoon of vinegar, and 1 of lemon juice,
and 1/2 saltspoon of cayenne pepper. Put on the ice until wanted.

Tarragon mayonnaise is made by substituting tarragon vinegar for
plain vinegar.




GREEN COLOURING FOR MAYONNAISE

This may be made of mixed herbs or spinach. If herbs are used take
1 tablespoon of parsley, 1 of watercress, and 1 of chervil, put them
into boiling water, let them cook eight minutes, then drain and pound
in a mortar, and press the pulp through a fine sieve. Use this with
mayonnaise to make a light delicate green colour.

If spinach is used press 1 tablespoon of chopped spinach through a
sieve, and use it to colour the sauce.




SALAD CHEESE BALLS

Use equal quantities of Neufchâtel cheese and grated American (or
Parmesan) cheese, sprinkle with cayenne, and dampen with a little
melted butter. Shape into tiny balls and use very cold as a salad
garnish.




AMERICAN SALAD

Use 1 cup of scraped thinly sliced celery, 1 cup of diced apples, 1/2
cup of chopped English walnuts, and 1/2 cup of seeded white grapes. Mix
well with mayonnaise, and serve on large curled lettuce leaves.




ARTICHOKE SALAD

Use cold boiled fresh artichokes, remove the thistles, and fill
the artichokes with finely minced chopped onion, apple, and beet,
blended with green mayonnaise; serve extra mayonnaise in which to
dip the artichoke leaves.




GREEN BEAN SALAD

Put a can of good "stringless" beans on the ice an hour before wanted,
open, drain, and arrange in a salad bowl with 2 teaspoons of grated
or finely chopped onion and 1 cup of French dressing. Serve ice-cold.




WAX BEAN SALAD

Make like the preceding, using 1 tablespoon of chopped chives or
shallots, or green onion tops instead of chopped onion.




BEET SALAD WITH CELERY

Cut boiled beets in thin slices and use a vegetable cutter to cut
them into fancy shapes. Mix 1 cup of beets with 1 cup of thinly sliced
celery, cover well with mayonnaise, serve on lettuce leaves.




CABBAGE SALAD

Slice firm white cabbage as thin as possible, then cut it across, mix
it with mayonnaise dressing, and serve on small white cabbage leaves.




CELERY AND PINEAPPLE SALAD

Use equal parts of thin strips of celery and shredded pineapple. Select
a perfectly ripe pineapple. Put the celery and pineapple each by
itself, and place on the ice. When time to serve mix them together
with mayonnaise, garnish with celery leaves, and serve at once.




CHERRY SALAD

When fresh cherries are available they are best, but the large cherries
in glass bottles are also suitable. Remove the stones from fresh
cherries, and in their places put blanched filberts or hazelnuts. Put
on curled lettuce leaves with a tablespoon of green mayonnaise on each.




CUCUMBER SALAD

Soak 2 unpeeled cucumbers in ice-cold water for twenty minutes or
more, then peel and use a patent scraper on the sides to serrate the
edges, or do this by drawing a silver fork firmly down the length
of the cucumber; this will make the slices have fancy edges. Slice,
and arrange with small white lettuce leaves in a salad bowl. Cover
with French dressing and add a sprinkling of paprika to the salad
itself before serving. Some sliced radishes may be added if liked.




COUNTRY SALAD

Use 1 cup each of finely sliced firm white cabbage, diced celery,
and chopped apple; mix them well with mayonnaise dressing, and serve
in the inner leaves from the cabbage.




RUSSIAN CUCUMBER SALAD

Prepare like plain cucumber salad, but put with the sliced cucumbers
1 small onion sliced thin, with the slices separated into rings. One
tablespoon of chives may be added, or more chives used and the onion
slices omitted.




DENT DE LION SALAD

Take young dandelion leaves, trim off all the stem below the
leaf, and mix with a French dressing to which has been added onion
juice or chopped chives; use 1 tablespoon of either to each cup of
dressing. Hard-boiled eggs, sliced or chopped, are sometimes used to
garnish this salad.




PINK EGG SALAD

Boil 6 or 8 eggs for ten minutes, put in cold water for two or three
minutes, then peel and put in a jar of pickled beets, well covered
with vinegar. Let them stand a few hours and serve with the beets.




ENDIVE SALAD

Wash heads of endive and use the crisp, white, light leaves. Shake
dry and cover with French dressing. Add 1 teaspoon of minced onion
before dressing.




FETTICUS OR CORN SALAD

Wash 2 cups of fetticus and dry the leaves well, then cover with
French dressing, and add 1 teaspoon of grated onion.




GARDEN SALAD

Take a handful of sorrel, 2 sprigs of chervil, 4 leaves of tarragon
(or use tarragon vinegar), 1 teaspoon of chopped chives, and the
small leaves from the heart of a head lettuce. Blend all well with
French dressing.




GRAPE-FRUIT SALAD

Wash and shake dry the fine leaves from a head lettuce, and arrange
with them in layers very thin slices of grape-fruit; mix well with
French dressing before serving.




ITALIAN SALAD

Having prepared 2 nice heads of head lettuce, arrange them in the
salad bowl with 2 seedless oranges which have been neatly peeled,
and cut into thin slices with a very sharp knife. Season with salt and
pepper, and then mix thoroughly with French dressing. The oranges and
lettuce should have been chilled so that the salad will be very cold.




LETTUCE SALAD

Pull apart a fresh head lettuce, breaking the leaves neatly from the
stalk, and wash those that need it and shake them dry. Put in a salad
bowl with French dressing or sauce vinaigrette, and mix well together
before serving.




MACEDOINE SALAD

Open a glass or can of imported macedoine of vegetables, drain, and
cover with French dressing. Arrange with lettuce leaves in a bowl or
on separate plates. Freshness can be added by a tablespoon of chopped
chives, or shallots, or parsley.




SPECIAL MIXED SALAD

Use 1 cup of chopped tomato, 1 cup of chopped cucumber, 1/2 cup of
thinly sliced radishes, 1/2 cup of chopped apple, and 2 tablespoons
of the German pearl pickled onions. Mix all together with 1 cup of
mayonnaise, and arrange in a salad bowl with lettuce leaves, which
should be used to hold the salad in serving.




MUSHROOM SALAD

Select fresh, firm mushrooms that are small, wash them carefully
without peeling, and stir them in French dressing that contains
rather more oil than usual. Put 1 crisp lettuce leaf on each plate,
fill it with the mushrooms, sprinkle with salt and a little paprika,
and serve very cold.




NARRAGANSETT SALAD

Wash and shake dry the fine white centre of endive or chicory,
and arrange with it quartered tomatoes from which the skin has been
removed; serve with a French dressing to which a tablespoon of chopped
parsley, 1/2 teaspoon of chopped onion, and 1 finely chopped egg has
been added.




PHILADELPHIA SALAD

Select large tomatoes, remove the skins by putting in boiling
water, cut out the inside, and refill with finely chopped pineapple,
celery, and apple in equal proportions, all well blended with plain
mayonnaise. Serve on lettuce leaves on separate plates, or use
watercress instead of lettuce.




PIMENTO SALAD WITH CHEESE BALLS

Mix 2 Neufchâtel cheeses with 1 cup of grated cheese, and when creamed
together add 6 olives stoned and chopped fine and 1 teaspoon of
chopped pimento; season generously with salt and pepper, moisten with
cream, and mould into balls an inch and a quarter through. Pimolas
(which are olives stuffed with pimentos) can of course be used if
more convenient, and a few drops of onion extract or a very little
onion juice adds piquancy to the cheese balls. Take lettuce which has
been in cold water and is therefore crisp, shake it dry, and arrange
with it pimentos cut in long half-inch strips, mix thoroughly with
a French dressing, and garnish with the cheese balls.




POLISH SALAD

Use boiled beets, sliced and mixed with French dressing, and over
all sprinkle chopped white of hard-boiled egg.

A little grated horse-radish is sometimes used with good effect in
beet salad.




GERMAN POTATO SALAD

Boil 6 medium-sized potatoes, and after draining shake them over
the fire a moment or two to dry; then peel and slice while warm, and
cover at once with a dressing made of 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon
of black pepper, 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, 1 chopped onion,
5 tablespoons of oil, and 3 tablespoons of vinegar. Mix and let stand
on ice for an hour or so, then put with crisp lettuce leaves in a
salad bowl, and garnish with chopped boiled or pickled beets.




AMERICAN POTATO SALAD

Mix cold sliced boiled potatoes with mayonnaise dressing and add 1
tablespoon of capers.




RED POTATO SALAD

Use equal quantities of boiled beets (canned ones are convenient)
and boiled potatoes. Dice both and mix well together, adding 1
tablespoon of vinegar. Let stand until the potatoes are reddened,
then add 1 tablespoon of grated onion, mix well with French dressing,
and garnish with slices of hard-boiled egg. Place in a salad bowl,
with fine white cabbage or crisp lettuce leaves.




ROMAINE SALAD

Pick over crisp heads of romaine, let stand a few minutes in cold
water, then shake until dry, and serve with French dressing to which
grated onion is added, using 1 teaspoon of it to each cup of dressing.




SOUTHERN SALAD

To 2 cups of cold boiled rice add 2 chopped hard-boiled eggs and
blend well with mayonnaise. Arrange on crisp lettuce leaves with a
garnish of egg slices, and beet, and sliced olives.




SORREL SALAD

A refreshing salad may be made from the sorrel found growing wild. Wash
it well, cut the stalks off, and dredge with salt, pepper, celery
salt, and then mix with oil, and sprinkle well with tarragon vinegar
and a little grated onion.




SPANISH SALAD

Remove the skins from large, solid tomatoes and 1 small cucumber,
take the seeds from 1 small sweet green pepper, pare 1 small Spanish
onion, and cut all in slices, making the peppers extremely thin. Mix
with 1 tablespoon of chopped nasturtium leaves or stems or seeds,
and cover with French dressing, mixing well. Let stand on ice an hour
before serving. Serve with cheese balls.




SUNDAY-NIGHT SALAD

Wash 1 large head of crisp head lettuce, separate the leaves, rejecting
all but perfect ones, and shake them dry. Put them in a large salad
bowl, and with them put 1 onion chopped very fine, 5 sliced tomatoes,
and the leaves from 3 or 4 sprigs of watercress. At the table dredge
the salad generously with salt, and sprinkle with black pepper,
covering the entire surface; then pour from an oil bottle 3 or 4
tablespoons of oil over the vegetables slowly, and follow this with
about 2 tablespoons of vinegar; add 1 tablespoon of tarragon vinegar,
then dredge with celery salt, and add a little cayenne, and mix all
together with a wooden fork and spoon, turning the whole mass over
and over ten or more times. The bowl may be well rubbed with garlic
and the onion omitted.




RUSSIAN TOMATO SALAD

Slice 5 or 6 very small tomatoes, and put with them 2 onions sliced
and divided into rings. Cover with French dressing.




SLICED TOMATO WITH CHIVES

Slice 4 tomatoes, put with them 3 tablespoons of chopped chives,
and cover with French dressing. Serve on lettuce leaves.




WALDORF SALAD

Use 1 cup of shelled walnuts, broken or chopped, 1 cup of diced tart
apple, 1 cup of crisp celery cut in small pieces, and mix well with
mayonnaise dressing. Serve on curly lettuce leaves.




WATERCRESS SALAD WITH ORANGES

Cut two inches off the bottom of a bunch of watercress with a sharp
knife, wash the cress thoroughly in ice-cold water, drain, and arrange
in a salad bowl with 3 seedless oranges cut in thin slices, and mix
all together with a dressing made of 1 tablespoon each of tarragon
vinegar, olive oil, and brandy; season well with salt and pepper,
and serve very cold.

Grape fruit can be substituted for the orange, or equal amounts of
orange and grape fruit used.




YOKOHAMA SALAD

Cut into small cubes 2 fresh cucumbers that have been on ice until
chilled and then peeled, and put with them 1 diced sour apple, 1
tablespoon of shredded pimentos, 1 small bunch of watercress (using
the leaves only), and 2 tablespoons of chopped mint leaves. Mix with
French dressing and serve on lettuce leaves.




A SALAD SUPPER

Use large dinner plates, and on each arrange 6 of the large light
green leaves from the inner part of head lettuce, putting 5 of them
with the stalk-end toward the centre of the plate, and another small
one in the centre. Fill the centre leaf with radishes (cut like roses)
and olives, and fill the others as follows: In one put 2 tablespoons
of canned green beans, well mixed, before putting on the leaf, with
a little grated onion and French dressing, on the second put 3 or 4
slices of tomato and 2 teaspoons of mayonnaise, on the third arrange 3
stalks of canned asparagus (white preferred) dipped in French dressing
and sprinkled with chopped chives, on the fourth put 2 half-lengths of
a quartered cucumber to be dipped in salt in eating, and on the fifth
put 1 tablespoon of tiny German pearl onions, 2 pickled walnuts, and
2 gherkins. Serve nut or plain bread, or creamed cheese sandwiches, or
all three. This supper may be varied in many ways; one is to use potato
salad or beet and egg instead of the beans. This as it stands was the
result of an emergency when six persons were suddenly to be served
to a late supper and no preparation made. A well-stocked store-room
of preserved goods and a small kitchen garden filled the need.








            No flocks that range the valley free,
              To slaughter I condemn;
            Taught by the power that pities me,
              I learn to pity them.

                                        Oliver Goldsmith.








SAVOURIES


The savoury begins a meal well, and is a convenient dainty for late
suppers. The variety is practically endless, and those given here
may be altered and added to indefinitely.




FRESH MUSHROOM "COCKTAILS"

Put a small handleless cup or glass in the centre of a plate and
encircle it with 6 of the smallest white leaves of lettuce. On
each leaf place 2 small white firm button mushrooms, which have
been freshly gathered and carefully washed but not peeled. Fill
the cocktail glass three quarters full of sauce made of 1/2 cup of
tomato chutney, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 2 drops of tabasco (more
if liked very hot), and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Set the plates in the
refrigerator for half an hour. Deliciously prepared "Cocktail" sauce
can be purchased in bottles.




CANNED MUSHROOM "COCKTAILS"

In each cocktail glass put 8 or 10 button mushrooms, and cover them
well with the cocktail sauce. Or use canned cêpes and serve in green
pepper cases.




PIMENTO "COCKTAILS"

Cut squares, an inch across, from sweet pimentos (canned), and put
8 or 10 of these in each glass; cover well with cocktail sauce and
serve ice-cold, with celery.




BEET SAVOURY

Use 1 large pickled beet and arrange neat slices on squares of bread;
in the centre of the beet put a ring of hard-boiled sliced egg, filled
with the riced egg-yolk, and fill each corner with chopped chives.




BEET AND EGG SAVOURY

Chop equal parts of pickled beet and the whites of hard-boiled eggs
together, and arrange on toast or bread with the riced yolks of the
eggs, mixed with a little chopped chives or parsley, in a cone on
the centre. Season well.




BROWN-BREAD SAVOURY

Cut brown bread into shapes, spread with butter, then heavily with
cream cheese containing some salt, and cross two evenly cut strips of
pimento on each piece of bread thus prepared. At the juncture of the
strips of pimento place a slice of pimola, and put one in each space on
the cheese. Sprinkle with paprika, and put a few capers here and there.




CUCUMBER SAVOURY

Cut bread in rounds and arrange on it neat slices of cucumber, the
edges serrated before slicing by drawing a silver fork lengthwise of
the cucumber. Sprinkle with salt and paprika, and on each slice put
a ring from a small sliced onion, or arrange instead the tiny German
pearl pickled onions between the slices of cucumber. Sprinkle a little
lemon juice over to serve. A variation is made by using chopped chives
only, or each ring of onion may be filled with them.




CREOLE SAVOURY

Toast one side of shaped pieces of bread, and butter the untoasted
side, and on it spread a layer of chopped tomato mixed with half as
much chopped green pepper and some salt. Put in the oven or under
the gas flame for five minutes, and upon removing arrange a cone of
finely chopped onion in the centre of each.




EGG SAVOURY

Use fresh bread slightly toasted or less soft bread without
toasting. Cut in squares, diamonds, or rounds, and sprinkle with
Worcestershire sauce, or any good sauce, then cover neatly with the
chopped whites of hard-boiled, well-salted eggs, on which arrange
a centre of the riced yolks. Put a round slice from a black pickled
walnut on each corner, dot with capers, and sprinkle with paprika.




HORSE-RADISH SAVOURY

Spread oblong pieces of bread thinly with mustard, cover with a layer
of chopped whites of hard-boiled eggs mixed with a little grated
horse-radish, arrange capers in strips crosswise of the bread, and
between these sprinkle the hard-boiled yolks of the eggs which have
been riced or pressed through a sieve. At the corners and in the
centre place thin slices of gherkins.




MUSTARD SAVOURY

Cut shaped pieces of bread and spread with made mustard. Cover
them with chopped hard-boiled eggs mixed with a little chopped
chives. Arrange capers in lines or any pattern on this. Season well.




NEUFCHÂTEL SAVOURY

Mix Neufchâtel cheese with 1/4 as much butter and rub to a cream,
and then squeeze through a tube onto salted, hot crackers, forming
star-like rosettes. Sprinkle with paprika, garnish with capers.




ONION SAVOURY

Use shaped pieces of bread and spread thinly with butter, then arrange
a quarter-inch layer of finely minced Spanish onion mixed with chopped
parsley and slightly dampened with tomato sauce; put in the centre of
each the ring of a slice of hard-boiled egg, with a slice of pickled
walnut fitted into it.




PICKLE SAVOURY

Spread any savoury sauce and then cream cheese on oblong pieces of
bread, and arrange on this thin slices of small sour pickles in a
neat row, lengthwise. Sprinkle with paprika.




STUFFED OLIVE SAVOURY

Arrange on squares of bread spread with tomato or any tart sauce
strips of riced yolk of hard-boiled egg; form squares by placing
them both ways of the bread, and in each put a ring of the white of
hard-boiled egg sliced, and fill the centre with a slice of pimola
or any other stuffed olive.




CAPER SAVOURY

Make same as the above using capers to fill the egg rings.




TOMATO MAYONNAISE SAVOURY

Chop tomatoes and mix with them a thick mayonnaise, either plain or
flavoured with herbs. Spread on shaped pieces of bread, and garnish
with thin rings sliced from green peppers.




TOMATO SAVOURY

Cut rounds of bread the size of the tomatoes to be used and toast
one side; then butter the other side and arrange on each a slice
of tomato, dredge with salt, pepper, and dry mustard, sprinkle with
mushroom catsup or walnut catsup, and set under the burners of a gas
stove for five minutes or until heated but not softened. Garnish with
watercress to serve.




LIPTAUER SAVOURY

Spread shaped pieces of bread with "Liptauer cheese" and garnish with
slices of pickle.




SWEET PIMENTO SAVOURY

Toast fresh bread slightly, cut into shapes and butter one side, and
on this arrange a trimmed piece of canned Spanish pimento sprinkled
with celery salt, and set under the gas flame of a gas stove for five
minutes to heat.




ROUNDS OF TOAST

To make rounds of bread or toast take an empty tin the size required
and press it firmly into a slice of bread, thus cutting the round
evenly and neatly.

Cutters for cutting vegetables into fancy shapes are convenient
for savouries.








    One farmer said to me, "You cannot live on vegetable food,
    for it furnishes nothing to make bones with;" and so he
    religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his
    system with the raw material of bones, walking all the
    while he talks, behind his oxen, who, with vegetable made
    bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of
    obstacles.

    I have found repeatedly of late years that I cannot fish
    without falling a little in self-respect.

The recipes given under Savouries can also be used in making
sandwiches, and originality can have full play here as in the making
of dainty and appetising savouries.




SAVOURY BUTTER SANDWICHES

Use unsalted or slightly salted butter, and with a silver knife press
into it any flavour desired,--onion juice, paprika, various sauces,
chopped peppers, or capers,--using 1 teaspoon of minced herbs, etc.,
to each tablespoon of butter. Spread in sandwiches.




PROVIDENCE HOUSE CLUB SANDWICHES

Cut fresh bread in medium thick slices, trim the four edges, and butter
it with butter somewhat softened by warmth. On one side of two slices
which belong next to each other put thinly sliced peeled tomatoes,
filling in bits to cover the bread neatly. Press 4 or 5 slices cut
from pickled walnuts into the juicy parts of the tomatoes, lay 6 or 7
capers also in, and use half a teaspoon of the tiny German pearl onion
pickles to each sandwich. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and celery salt,
and spread with mayonnaise. Press the other piece of bread firmly on,
and wrap in waxed paper for picnics.

Vary with chopped chives, tarragon leaves, French dressing, etc.




APPLE SANDWICHES

Arrange thinly sliced, cored apples between layers of buttered bread
from which the crust has been cut. Sprinkle with salt and spread with
mayonnaise, into which a few chopped nuts have been mixed.




CREOLE SANDWICHES

Trim and butter squares of bread and fit to them thinly sliced
tomatoes, and spread with thin mustard; slice green peppers very thin,
and arrange sections of the rings here and there over the tomatoes. Use
a little minced chives or shallot, or onions, and season with salt
and pepper and lemon juice or some sauce.




BOMBAY SANDWICHES

Spread squares of bread with curry paste, and cover with chopped
tomato to which is added a little chopped onion and the same amount
of chopped sour apples. Season with salt.




PEANUT-BUTTER SANDWICHES

Spread small oblong pieces of bread, from which the crust is cut,
with peanut butter blended with cream, and press firmly together.




EGG SANDWICHES

Break 2 eggs into a frying pan containing a little melted butter and
let them spread, breaking the yolk with a spoon after they are in the
pan; let them fry until the edges begin to brown, then season with
salt and pepper, and sprinkle with chopped chives. Cut pieces out to
fit the bread slices to be used, and, after trimming and buttering
the bread, arrange them on one side of the sandwich. Use with no
other flavouring, or sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce, or spread
with mustard. Wrap in waxed paper for picnics.




NUT SANDWICHES

Mix chopped nuts in thick cream or mayonnaise, and spread between
slices of bread, either with or without a lettuce leaf. Sprinkle
with cayenne.




LETTUCE SANDWICHES

Spread oblong slices of trimmed bread with butter, lay a lettuce leaf
between, trimmed to size, and spread with plain or green mayonnaise.




PIMOLA SANDWICHES

Butter small squares of bread and arrange on them sliced pimolas or any
stuffed olives, sprinkle with lemon juice, or spread with mayonnaise.




PICKLE SANDWICHES

Slice large pickles and arrange them between buttered bread slices. If
German Dill pickles are used and German flavours liked sprinkle with
caraway seeds, and use rye bread.




CHEESE SANDWICHES

Cut American or Swiss cheese very thin, spread with mustard, and
place a piece, trimmed to the size of the bread used, between two
pieces of buttered white or rye bread.




GERMAN SANDWICHES

Use rye or "black" bread, with caraway seeds baked in it, spread the
two slices with unsalted butter, and on one arrange thin slices of
Swiss cheese; spread this with German or French mustard, and arrange
on it 2 or 3 slices of Dill pickles.




HONOLULU SANDWICHES

Pare and core 3 apples, stem and seed 2 sweet green peppers, and put
them through a vegetable mill. Mix them into 2 Neufchâtel cheeses,
and use as filling for brown or white bread sandwiches.








            He prayeth well who loveth well
            Both man and bird and beast;
            He prayeth best who loveth best
            All things both great and small;
            For the dear God who loveth us,
            He made and loveth all.

                                        Coleridge.








PASTRY, PATTY CASES, Etc.


PIE-CRUST

Shortened pie-crust is made by using for one pie 2/3 of a cup of flour,
with 1/3 of a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt
in it. Sift this onto 1/2 a cup of cocoanut butter or 1/2 a cup of
butter, or these two in equal proportions, dampen with ice-water,
and roll out five or six times. Keep ice-cold until used.




EASY PUFF PASTE

Use a chopping bowl for mixing the paste, and into it put 4 cups of
flour (sifted), 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt, adding
it a spoonful at a time. Use 2 cups of butter, chopping it into the
flour until it is as fine as possible. Beat 2 eggs for five minutes
and add to them the juice of one lemon and 1/2 cup of very cold water,
and stir this gradually into the paste. When mixed lift the paste
to a well-floured pastry board, roll it into a rectangular shape,
fold it over onto itself from the four sides, then roll again, and
repeat this process four times. Now fold into a thin piece of linen,
and place on a plate near the ice in the refrigerator, and let it stand
half an hour or more. Roll out again and use for patties, or pie-crust.




TIMBALE CASES

Make a batter of 3/4 of a cup of flour, 1/2 cup of milk in which 1
egg has been beaten, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 saltspoon of salt, and
at the very last add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Dip the timbale iron
in the batter, then in hot vegetable fat, taking care it does not
touch the bottom of the pan. When a golden brown remove and place on
paper to drain, and proceed thus until a sufficient number has been
made. Fill with chestnuts, mushrooms, etc., in sauce, and reheat in
the oven after filling.




BATTER FOR FRITTERS

Make as for timbale cases and dip the vegetables or fruit to be fried
in it, and fry until golden brown in hot fat.




PASTRY FOR PATTY PANS OR CASES

Instead of frying-batter for timbale cases a paste can be made with 1
1/2 cups of flour, 1 egg-yolk, and 3 tablespoons of butter well-mixed
and dampened to the proper consistency by using perhaps 1/2 cup of
cold water. Roll out very thin, about 1/16 of an inch, and press into
the small pans or moulds after buttering them. Trim neatly, and press
a little cup of buttered tissue paper in each, fill this with rice to
protect the inside from too much heat and to keep flat on the bottom,
and bake in a rather slow oven. Do not turn out until cooled, and do
not fill until wanted.

Ordinary pastry may be used also to line moulds for patty cases,
timbales, etc.




POTATO CRUST

Boil good-sized potatoes with the skins on, peel while hot, and press
through a ricer or sieve, mix with an equal quantity of white flour
or whole wheat flour and a little salt, and dampen with cream. Press
together and roll out for top crust of vegetable pies.




ESSEX PASTRY

Mix equal parts of mashed potato and flour pastry, and use baked in
small squares as a garnish, or as a covering for deep vegetable pie.




DUMPLINGS

Sift 2 cups of flour, add to it 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder
and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and sift again. Stir into this 1 scant cup
of milk, or just enough to make a dough that can scarcely be handled
without sticking to the fingers. Drop in boiling vegetable stock or
into a stew and let boil rapidly ten minutes, taking great care not
to uncover the kettle until just as the dumplings are removed. Serve
at once in the stew or with brown sauce.




CROUTONS

Cut slices 1/4 of an inch thick of stale bread, and with a knife cut
across both ways to make tiny squares. Dry a few moments, then toss
in a little hot butter to brown and serve warm.




BREAD CRUMBS

A jar of bread crumbs should always be kept on hand. Use stale bread,
break it into bits, and brown it slightly in the oven. Then with a
roller, or in a mortar, crumble it and crush it to powdered crumbs. If
a jar of light crumbs and one of golden brown crumbs are kept ready,
they will be found most convenient.








            A small unkindness is a great offence.

                                                Hannah More.








A FEW HOT BREADS


BAKING POWDER BISCUITS

Take 2 tablespoons of butter and sift onto them lightly 2 cups of
flour in which 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder is mixed, and
with freshly washed, cool hands mix the flour and butter thoroughly
together, then pour on slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon, 1 cup
of milk; with most flours this cup of milk or a very little less
will make the biscuit dough of the proper consistency, but if too
thin or too thick, judgment must be used, as the dough should be so
that with well-floured hands it can scarcely be handled, but can with
rapid motions be made into a roll which will keep its shape when put
on a well-floured bread board. It should then be rolled lightly with
a roller to the thickness of three quarters of an inch, and with a
biscuit cutter, the edge of which should be dipped in flour before
using, cut the rounds quickly out and place them at once in a shallow
buttered pan and set in the oven. They should be properly cooked in
eighteen or twenty minutes. The smallest sized baking powder tin is
exactly the right size for a biscuit cutter.

This same recipe makes dumplings, strawberry short-cake, and the top
of vegetable pies.




POP OVERS

Mix 1 saltspoon of salt with 1 cup of flour, and add slowly enough
from 1 cup of milk to just make a smooth paste; stir this well, then
add the remaining milk and the beaten yolk of 1 egg, and then the
white whisked to a stiff froth. Put the batter in buttered gem pans
or earthenware cups, and cook in the oven about twenty-five minutes,
or until browned and standing very high. Serve at once.




GRAHAM GEMS

Mix 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon
of sugar, and stir onto this 1 cup of milk containing the beaten
yolks of 2 eggs, then add the beaten whites of the eggs, and put in
hot buttered gem pans. Bake about twenty-five minutes.




TENNESSEE CORN BREAD

Beat 2 eggs in a mixing bowl, add 1 heaping teaspoon of granulated
sugar, and 1 cup of milk; mix 1/2 cup of white flour, 1 cup of yellow
corn meal, and 3 teaspoons of baking powder, and sift these into the
milk, stirring constantly. The batter should be thin enough to spread
readily when poured into the inch-deep baking pan. Just before pouring
in the batter put 1 tablespoon of butter in the baking tin and when
it melts, stir the batter into it; this is the secret of crisp brown
bottom crust and was learned from an old negro cook. Bake twenty
minutes to half an hour or until tinged with brown.




SOUTHERN RICE MUFFINS

With 1 cup of boiled rice put 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter,
the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 tablespoon
of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 heaping teaspoon of baking
powder. After mixing well add the well-beaten whites of the eggs,
pour into hot buttered gem pans, and bake in a quick oven from twenty
to twenty-five minutes.




RICE GRIDDLECAKES

Mix well together 2 eggs, 2 cups of milk, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1
tablespoon of sugar, 2 cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder,
and 1 1/2 cups of boiled rice. Bake on a hot buttered griddle,
browning both sides.




CORN CAKES

In 1 1/2 cups of sour milk put 1 teaspoon of soda, 1 beaten egg,
1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 scant 1/2 cup of white
flour, and thicken with enough yellow corn meal to make a thin
batter. Fry a golden brown on a hot buttered griddle.




WHEAT CAKES

Beat 2 eggs lightly and pour over them 2 cups of milk; mix 2 teaspoons
of baking powder with 2 cups of flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt,
and sift lightly into the milk, stirring constantly. Cook in small
pancakes on a hot buttered griddle.




GINGERBREAD

Beat the yolks of 2 eggs lightly, melt 1/2 cup of butter and add to
the eggs, then stir in 1/2 cup of milk, 1 teaspoon of soda, and 1
1/2 cups of dark molasses. Then add slowly 3 cups of sifted flour and
1 tablespoon of ginger, and after beating the whites of the eggs to
a stiff froth stir them in with a fork. Bake in an inch-deep baking
pan in a slow oven for three quarters of an hour.




SUNDAY MORNING WAFFLES

Beat 2 eggs thoroughly, and add to them 2 cups of milk and 1 saltspoon
of salt, and sift into the milk 2 cups of flour containing 2 heaping
teaspoons of baking powder, stirring constantly. Some flour thickens
more than others, and if more must be added sift it before stirring
in. The secret of the excellence of waffles is not getting the batter
too thick; it must spread readily when put upon the iron but not
run. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter and put it in the batter at the
last moment. Butter the hot waffle iron, using a bristle brush an
inch or so wide for the purpose, over half-fill the iron with batter
(using a large spoon), let one side brown, and then turn, to brown
the other. Divide into the four parts indicated by the iron and serve
with maple syrup.








            God made all the creatures
            And gave them our love and our fear,
            To give sign that we and they
            Are His children,--one family here.

                                        Robert Browning.








PLUM PUDDING AND MINCE PIE


PLUM PUDDING

Blanch 1 cup of almonds and 1/2 cup of Brazil nuts, and put them
through a fine grinder; add to them 1 cup of blanched chopped walnuts,
and mix with these 2 cups of very fine bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of butter,
1/2 cup of brown sugar, the grated rind of 3 lemons (washed well before
grating), 2 cups of seedless raisins, 2 cups of currants, 2 cups of
light Sultana raisins, 1 cup of mixed candied peel finely shredded,
and when well blended stir into this six slightly beaten eggs and 1
teaspoon of salt. Put in a pudding basin and steam or boil for eight
hours; boil several hours to reheat the day it is to be used. Serve
with brandy sauce and nun's butter.




PLUM PUDDING SAUCE

Beat 1 egg until very light, stir into it 1 cup of sugar, and when
blended add 3 tablespoons of boiling water and cook over boiling
water for five minutes, adding 1 wineglass of brandy during the last
two minutes' cooking.




NUN'S BUTTER

Beat 1/2 cup of butter until creamy, and add slowly to it 1 cup of
powdered (or granulated) sugar. Add 1 tablespoon of vanilla, lemon,
or brandy, and a sprinkling of grated nutmeg.




MINCE PIE

Bake 3 large apples, and press them through a sieve to remove skins
and cores; grate the rinds from 3 lemons, and add this and the juice
of the lemons to the apple pulp; wash, pick over, and bruise in a
mortar 1 cup of currants; stone 2 cups of raisins, and cut them
in slices. Mix these all well together, chop into them 1 cup of
butter (or cocoanut butter), a little salt, 4 cups of brown sugar,
1 tablespoon of candied lemon peel, 1 tablespoon of candied citron,
and 1 tablespoon of candied orange peel, all well minced, and after
stirring well, add 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade and 1/2 cup of
good brandy. Put in sealed glass jars, cover with wax or brandied
paper before the jar is closed, and use for pies in two weeks.








    "Wilt thou draw near the Nature of the gods? Draw near them
    in being merciful. Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge."

                                                              Shakspere.








MENUS

Menus in a cook-book are perhaps not always worth the space devoted to
them, but as the beginner in Vegetarianism often finds the arranging
of a menu in such a way that it does not depart too far from the
accustomed manner of serving food the most difficult part of the
task she has set herself, a few menus are here given, more with an
idea of showing what dishes are most suitable as Entremets, Piecès
de Resistance, and Entrées, than with the thought that they will be
followed absolutely, for they can of course be changed in many ways,
and very much simplified for ordinary use, and amplified for formal
occasions.

    The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
    lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the
    fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

    And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie
    down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

    And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the
    weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

    They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the
    earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
    cover the sea.

                                                         Isaiah xi, 6-9.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
