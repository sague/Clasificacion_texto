                                PREFACE


A score of years ago (1880–1885) I was living in the mountains of West
Virginia. While riding on horseback through the dense forests of that
great unfenced state, I saw on every side luxuriant growths of fungi, so
inviting in color, cleanliness and flesh that it occurred to me they
ought to be eaten. I remembered having read a short time before this
inspiration seized me a very interesting article in the Popular Science
Monthly for May, 1877, written by Mr. Julius A. Palmer, Jr., entitled
“Toadstool Eating.” Hunting it up I studied it carefully, and soon found
myself interested in a delightful study which was not without immediate
reward. Up to this time I had been living, literally, on the fat of the
land—bacon; but my studies enabled me to supplement this, the staple
dish of the state, with a vegetable luxury that centuries ago graced the
dinners of the Cæsars. So absorbing did the study become from
gastronomic, culinary and scientific points of view, that I have
continued it ever since, with thorough intellectual enjoyment and much
gratification of appetite as my reward. I hope to interest students in
the study as I am myself interested.

For twenty years my little friends—the toadstools—have been my constant
companions. They have interested me, delighted me, fed me, and I have
found much pleasure in making the public acquainted with their habits,
structure, lusciousness and food value.

My researches have been confined to the species large enough to appease
the appetite of a hungry naturalist if found in reasonable quantity; and
my work has been devoted to segregating the edible and innocuous from
the tough, undesirable and poisonous kinds. To accomplish this, because
of the persistent inaccuracy of the books upon the subject, it was
necessary to personally test the edible qualities of hundreds of species
about which mycologists have either written nothing or have followed one
another in giving erroneous information. While often wishing I had not
undertaken the work because of the unpleasant results from personally
testing fungi which proved to be poisonous, my reward has been generous
in the discovery of many delicacies among the more than seven hundred
edible varieties I have found.

For ten years I have planned to publish in book form what I know about
toadstools; each effort to compile my information has shown me how much
more I ought to know before going into print. Even now my work is still
unfinished.

I am urged by my many toadstool friends (as I lovingly call those who,
from all over the land, send me specimens for identification, and grow
interested with me in the work), to publish what I already know upon the
subject, that they, and others, may have a helpful book to guide them to
a goodly portion of the edible species, and away from those that are
inedible or poisonous.

In this book I comply with these requests. I have selected over seven
hundred of the most plentiful and best varieties for the table, from my
toadstool bill of fare; and I describe and caution against several
species, some of which are deadly in their effects, if eaten; others of
which induce ill-effects more or less serious. One thousand species and
varieties are named and described.

Birds, flowers, insects, stones delight the observant. Why not
toadstools? A tramp after them is absorbing, study of them interesting,
and eating of them health-giving and supremely satisfying.

                                                      CHARLES MCILVAINE.




                              INTRODUCTION


America is without a text-book of the American species of Fungi, among
which the edible and poisonous varieties are found. Many excellent but
expensive foreign volumes describe species common to both continents,
and several special but widely scattered monographs have been published
here. The need of the mycologist, mycophagist and amateur toadstool
student is a book giving the genus, names and descriptions of the
prominent American toadstools whose edibility has been tested, or whose
poisonous qualities have been discovered. The absence of such a book,
and the universal and rapidly-growing interest all over the United
States in edible fungi, have led to the publication of the present work,
which includes every species known to be esculent in North America. As a
precautionary measure, full explications of all those known or suspected
to be poisonous are included.

Many species found in this country only have been described and named by
various authors, from the time of Schweinitz (1822) to the present day.
These have been published in the botanical magazines and in the papers
of scientific societies and colleges. The greater number have as author
Professor Charles H. Peck, New York State Botanist, who has contributed
an annual report each year from 1868. These appear in the reports of the
State Museum of New York, and coming from the pen of our ablest
mycologist are of great value to everyone interested in the study. The
classifications and (in many instances) modified descriptions by such an
eminent authority upon fungoid growth should therefore be the guides to
American forms, that the confusion created by numerous descriptions of
the same fungus by different observers may be avoided.

Professor N.L. Britton, editor of the Torrey Botanical Club, has
courteously given permission to use the descriptions of new species
given in its instructive Bulletins.

Professor A.P. Morgan and Laura V. Morgan, with equal courtesy, grant
the use of text and illustrations contained in the most complete
monograph published upon the Lycoperdaceæ (puff-balls, etc.) of America.

While the scientific classifications and descriptions have been strictly
followed, the language has been simplified—with no sacrifice of
scientific accuracy—that this volume may be fully adapted to popular
use.

Professor Peck has given his valuable assistance in the identification
of many species, all that were difficult or obscure having been
submitted to him, and the writer is deeply indebted to him for many and
long-continued courtesies, aiding in study and in the preparation of
this work.

Several new species have been found by the writer, the greater part of
excellent food value. He preferred that these should be named, described
and placed in their proper genus and section by Professor Peck,
believing it to be best for the discoverers of new species to defer to
one whose vast experience enables him to name and classify in accordance
with the demands of American species.

Where a species is vouched for as edible, it has been personally tested
by the author and his willing undertasters up to eating full meals of
it, or at least beyond all doubt as to its safety. Where others have
eaten species which he has not had the opportunity to test, their names
and opinions are given. When species heretofore under the ban of
suspicion are in this volume, for the first time, announced to be edible
(there are many of them), personal tests have not been considered
sufficient, as idiosyncrasy might have affected the results. Others, at
the writer’s request, have eaten of the species until their innocence
was fully established. In some cases, where the reputation of the fungi
eaten was especially bad, scientists of note have made elaborate and
exhaustive physiological tests of their substances, and in every
instance confirmed the human testing.

While species which contain deadly poisons are few, their individuals
are produced in great number. Nicety in distinguishing their botanic
variance from edible species closely resembling them is necessary. No
charm will detect the poison. Eating toadstools before their certain
identification as belonging to edible species, is neither bravery nor
common sense. The amateur should go slow.

The question often asked is: By what rule do you distinguish between
edible and poisonous mushrooms? The answer usually surprises the
questioner—there is no general rule. All such rules which have been
given are false and unreliable. The quality of each was learned, one at
a time. Sweet and sour apples alike grow on large and small trees, may
be red or green, large or small, oblong or globular, and no visible
appearance gives the least clue to the quality.

In a few genera certain rules may be applied, as in Clavaria--all not
bitter or tough are edible. But such generalizations are each limited to
its own genus.

The toadstools containing deadly poisons are thought to be confined to
one genus of the gilled kind—Amanita, and to Helvella esculenta, now
Gyromitra esculenta, to which are charged fatal results. The poisonous
qualities of Gyromitra esculenta are not proven. Recent testings of this
species prove it to be harmless and of good quality. By far the greater
number of species contained in Amanita are notable for their tender
substance and delicious flavor. By their stately beauty and unusual
attractiveness both the poisonous and harmless kinds are seductive. _Any
toadstool with white or lemon-yellow gills, casting white spores when
laid—gills downward—upon a sheet of paper, having remnants of a fugitive
skin in the shape of scabs or warts upon the upper surface of its cap,
with a veil or ring, or remnants or stains of one, having at the base of
its stem—in the ground—a loose, skin-like sheath surrounding it, or
remnants of one, should never be eaten until the collector is thoroughly
conversant with the technicalities of every such species, or has been
taught by one whose authority is well known, that it is a harmless
species._ This rule purposely includes the renowned Amanita Cæsaria,
everywhere written as luscious. I regard it as the most dangerous of
toadstools, because of its close resemblance to its sister plant—the
Amanita muscaria—which is deadly. In the description of these species,
other forcible reasons are given.

Another deadly species—the Amanita phalloides—is frequently mistaken by
the inexperienced for the common mushroom. Safety lies in the strict
observance of two rules: Never eat a toadstool found in the woods or
shady places, believing it to be the common mushroom. Never eat a white-
or yellow-gilled toadstool in the same belief. The common mushroom does
not grow in the woods, and its gills are at first pink, then
purplish-brown or black.

If through carelessness, or by accident, a poisonous Amanita has been
eaten, and sickness results, take an emetic at once, and send for a
physician with instructions to bring hypodermic syringe and atropine
sulphate. The dose is 1⁄180 of a grain, and doses should be continued
heroically until the 1⁄20 of a grain is administered, or until, in the
physician’s opinion, a proper quantity has been injected. Where the
victim is critically ill the 1⁄20 of a grain may be administered.

In every case of toadstool poisoning, the physician must be guided by
the symptoms exhibited. Professor W.S. Carter, by numerous exhaustive
trials upon animals, has proved that atropine, while valuable as against
the _first_, is not an antidote for the _late_ effects of the greater
toadstool poisons. (See his chapter on toadstool poisons, especially
prepared for this work.)

There are other species which contain minor poisons producing very
undesirable effects. These are soon remedied by taking an emetic, then
one or two doses of whisky and sweet oil; or vinegar may be substituted
for the whisky. A few species of fungi are innocuous to the majority of
persons and harmful to a few. So it is with many common
foods—strawberries, apples, tomatoes, celery, even potatoes. The
beginner at toadstool eating usually expects commendation for bravery,
and fearfully watches for hours the coming of something dreadful.
Indigestion from any other cause is always laid to the traditionary
enemy, fright ensues, a physician is called, the scare spreads, and a
pestilential story of “Severe Poisoning by Toadstools,” gets into the
newspapers. The writer has traced many such publications to imprudences
in eating, with which toadstools had nothing to do.

The authoritative analysis of several common food species by Lafayette
B. Mendel, of Sheffield Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Yale
University, is given, and will correct the popular error about the great
nutritive value of fungi, arising from previous erroneous analyses.

While species are reported as found in certain localities, it by no
means follows that their growth is confined to these places. A species
reported as found in the Adirondack mountains, unless belonging to the
few peculiar to northern regions and high altitudes, is reasonably sure
to be more plentiful in a like habitat south and west of them. South it
will appear earlier and its season last longer.

Size is largely dependent upon latitude and may vary greatly in the same
group. Temperature, moisture, favorable nourishment are important
factors in growth.

Each species has its favorite habitat, and will thrive best upon it.
There are few things under the sun upon which fungi do not grow. Their
mission is particularly directed toward converting decaying matter, or
matter which has accomplished its work in one direction, into usefulness
in another. They are the wood-choppers, stewards, caterers of the
forest, converters in the fields and chemists everywhere. They can not
assimilate inorganic matter because of the absence of chlorophyl in
their composition, but in organic matter they are omnivorous. When they
feed on dead substances they are called saprophytes; when their support
is derived from living tissues, parasites.

Scores of species of fungi were found in the forests, ravines and
clearings of the West Virginia mountains from 1881 to 1885 inclusive,
and eaten by the writer years before he had the opportunity to learn
their names from books or obtain the friendly assistance of experts in
identifying them. He knew the individuals without knowing their names,
as one knows the bird song and plumage before formal introduction to the
pretty creatures that charm him.

After he was able to get European publications upon the subject, and by
their aid trace the species he had eaten to their names, descriptions
and qualities, he was surprised to read that many of them were warned
against as deadly. As informed by these books, he properly ought to have
died several times. It soon became evident that authors had followed one
another in condemning species, some because they bore brilliant hues,
others because they were unpleasant when raw (just as is a potato),
rather than investigate their qualities by testing them. Here was a
realm of food-giving plants almost entirely unexplored. The writer
determined to explore it. Instead of the one hundred and eleven species
then recorded by the late Doctor Curtis as edible, my number of edible
species now exceeds his by over six hundred.[A]

Footnote A:

  This book contains one hundred and fifty pages more than were
  originally estimated and promised to the subscribers. That all known
  edible and poisonous species might be fully described and published
  within one volume, the author was compelled to cut fifty thousand
  words from his manuscript. The localities from which species have been
  reported and the names of the reporters have been taken out, excepting
  where it was desirable to show that foreign species have been found in
  the United States, and where tested species have been found by the
  author. The principal cut has been from the notes of the author and of
  enlarged descriptions.

Let us clear away the rubbish and superstition that have so long
obscured the straight path to a knowledge of edible toadstools. Let us
bear in mind that a mushroom is a toadstool and a toadstool is a
mushroom—the terms are interchangeable. If toads ever occupied the
one-legged seat assigned them from time immemorial, they have learned in
this enlightened age that the ground is much more reliable, and so squat
upon it, except when exercising their constitutional right to hop.
Snails, slugs, insects of many kinds, mice, squirrels and rabbits prey
upon good and bad, each to its liking, notwithstanding oft-repeated
assertion that snails and slugs infect noxious varieties only, or that
animals select the innocuous only. We are warned against those which
grow in the dark or damp; the mushroom of commerce is grown by the ton
in the subterranean quarries of France, and everywhere in vaults and
cellars for domestic use. The valued truffle never sees the light until
it is taken from darkness to be eaten, and other varieties of the best
prefer seclusion.

The wiseacres tell us that they must have equal gills, must not have
thin tops, must not turn yellow when sprinkled with salt, must not
blacken a silver spoon, that we must not eat of those changing color
when cut or broken, of those exuding milk, or those which are acrid,
hot, or bitter, and give many other specifics for determining the good
from the bad. These tests are all worse than worthless, for if
confidence is placed in them they will not only lead us away from
esculent and excellent varieties but directly into eating venomous ones.

There are whole genera of fungi which are innocuous; but in the Family
of Agaricaceæ, where the greatest variety of the edible and poisonous
species are found, it is necessary to master one by one the details of
their construction and learn to distinguish their differences as one
does those of the many kinds of roses, or pinks, or hundreds of
bright-faced pansies, and in the mastery of them lies the only charm
that will safely guide.

Carefully remove the first toadstool found from whatever it is growing
upon, and with it a portion of that from which it springs. If it is the
earth a curious white network is discernible, fine as the delicate
spinning of the spider, spreading its meshes throughout the mass. It
will often remind of miniature vines climbing over miniature lattices.
This is the mycelium from which the toadstool grew. In many instances it
penetrates the earth to a considerable depth, and takes possession of
large territory. It is often seen as the gardener turns up the soil or
its fertilizer, and is perhaps taken for a mold. If the specimen is
gathered from mat of wood leaves, the same white vine is observable
slipping in between its layers. If taken from a tree, the decaying wood
is traversed by it. From wherever a toadstool is plucked, it is removed
from its mycelium.

This mycelium is but a thread-like mass of simple cells joined together
at their ends and interlacing in a way a thousand-fold more intricate
than a Chinese puzzle. Nothing in its structure indicates what its
special product will be. The fungus which is plucked from it is in all
its parts simply a mass of these threads—cells strung together,
interlacing and ramifying.

When the season favors, the mycelium—which has, winter and summer and
from year to year, lived its hidden life, or has sprung from a
germinating spore—develops a number of its cells in a minute knob, small
as a pin head. At this point the cells make special growth efforts to
bring themselves within the favoring influences of heat and moisture;
this tiny knob labors within itself, producing cell after cell, which
takes shape and function for the future toadstool.

As it rapidly enlarges it pushes its way toward the surface of the
ground, becomes more or less egg-shaped in this stage of its growth, and
if cut in half longitudinally and examined, it will display what it is
going to be when it grows up.

Suppose that it belongs to the first of the two great sections into
which fungi are divided under the classification of Fries, who modified
that of Persoon. The first has the spores—which represent the seeds in
plants—naked, and it is called sporifera or spore-bearing. The second,
which has the spores enclosed in cells or cysts, is called sporidifera
or sporidia-bearing. If the cap of a gill-bearing toadstool be laid,
gills downward, on a watch crystal or piece of white paper for a few
hours, or, in some instances, a few minutes, a complete representation
of the spaces between the gills will be found deposited as an impalpable
powder. These are the spores.

The first section is divided into four cohorts. Two of these have
hymeniums or spore-bearing surfaces more or less expanded. These are
Hymenomycetes and Gastromycetes. In Hymenomycetes the hymenium is always
exposed in matured plants, as with the common mushroom. When young, some
plants are covered with a membrane. In Gastromycetes the hymenium is
always concealed within a covering which bursts at maturity, as with the
Lycoperdons or puff-balls. Cohort Coniomycetes includes rusts, smuts,
etc., formed for the most part on living plants. There is no hymenium
present. The spores are produced on the ends of inconspicuous threads,
free or enclosed in a bottle-like receptacle called a perithecium.
Cohort Hypomycetes is composed of those species of fungi commonly called
molds. The spores are produced, naked, from the ends of inconspicuous
threads.

In the Agaricaceæ—the first family in Hymenomycetes—the young plant is
completely enveloped. (Plate III, fig. B, p. 2.) Its head is as yet
undefined and its body may be classed as dumpy, but shut in and
protected are a great quantity of knife-like plaits (Plate III, fig. C.,
p. 2), on the outer surface of which, when the plant matures, will be
borne its spores. It therefore belongs to the Hymenomycetes, and to the
Family Agaricaceæ—gill-bearing.

If the ground becomes moist or there comes a heavy dew or a rain, the
young plant, closely compacted and very solid, which has been under the
surface for many days waiting its chance to get forth to light and air,
rapidly swells, breaks through the moistened earth, goes rapidly to
cell-making, ruptures its outside covering, the head expands and in so
doing spreads out its gills or hymenium. (Plate III, figs. C, D, E, p.
2.) The membrane which covered the gills either vanishes, or gathers
round the stem in the form of a ring or circular apron, or it may
partially adhere to the edges of the top, cap or pileus and hang as a
fringe from it; the stem elongates; the whole plant assumes the colors
of its species and in a few hours or days at most it stands forth, a
marvel of beauty, structure and workmanship.

But little is known of how these spores reproduce themselves. The
microscope fails to completely penetrate the mystery. A whole fungus is
but a mass of cells, the spore is but one of them. That these simple
cells do produce after their kind there is no doubt, but so minute is
the germ and hidden its methods that science has failed to solve them.

The first Family of Hymenomycetes is Agaricaceæ. Its members always have
gills or modifications of them. In some cases—notably in
Cantharellus—the gills have the appearance of smooth, raised veins over
which is the spore-bearing surface. The hymenium is but an extension of
the fibers of the cap, folded up like the plaits and flutings of
ruffles, and laundered with exquisite neatness. If it is carefully
detached and spread out like a fan it will cover a large surface, many
times the size of the cap from which it has been taken, and will show
that what is a consumption of material in dress ornamentation is
utilized by economical Dame Nature to increase the spore-bearing surface
within a small space and for purely business purposes—spore-bearing. The
color of these spores has much to do with the classification. The
microscope with high light reveals the delicate shades of their
coloring, but the main colors are readily distinguished by the naked eye
when the spores are collected in a mass on glass or paper.

The Polyporaceæ have in place of gills closely packed tubes on the
inside of which is the spore-bearing surface; each has a mouth from
which to eject the spores.

The Hydnaceæ bear their spores from spines or spicules of various length
protruding from the external surface of the cap. Sometimes the spines
mock in miniature the stalactites of the Caverns of Luray, sometimes the
shaggy mane of the lion, sometimes flowing locks of hair. These three
Families belong to the Cohort Hymenomycetes, having their spore-bearing
surface exposed early in life by the rupture of the universal veil.

The Lycoperdons or Puff-balls have the hymenium enclosed within an outer
case, just as the apple with its seeds is enclosed for a dumpling. When
the spores are matured the sack is ruptured and they escape as the dusty
powder so well known to all. The Puff-ball belongs to the Cohort
Gastromycetes, because its spores are protected within the hymenium
until they are matured.

There are other Families which contain edible species. The
Clavariaceæ—branched or club-shaped—often found in as beautiful forms as
delight us in coral, includes a few.

In Ascomycetes, of the covered spore division Sporidifera, there are
several species which are excellent, and as they dry readily are much
valued for flavoring purposes when winter forbids the growth of outdoor
fungi. Of these the Morell has preference. The cap is covered with
sinuosities and pits which bear the spores. There are several varieties
of the Morell in the United States. They are known among the country
people who cook and pickle them, as Honey-comb mushrooms.

The Tuberaceæ are subterranean fungi. The common truffle so much prized
by epicures is a good representative. It is found a foot or more under
the surface of the earth, and of such value is it that in some countries
pigs are trained to hunt it from its hiding place. It is one of the few
foreign growths apparently not taking kindly to our country. Efforts
have been made to import and cultivate it, but without success. It is
possible, even probable, that it may yet be found in America by
assiduous search.

I have said that there is but one way to distinguish the edible from the
non-edible fungi; that is by mastering the characteristics of each
species one by one. There are signs which point to the evil and those
which point to the good, but they must be used as signals, not
directors.

A nauseous, fetid odor should condemn a species as non-edible at once.
Those having the flavor of flour or fresh meal are generally accepted as
worthy of trial. Slimy, water-soaked, partially decomposed plants, or
those impressing one as unpleasant in any way, should never find their
place upon the table. Do not eat of any toadstool, unknown to the
collector, beyond the careful and systematic testing required to
determine whether it is edible or not.

A few species have a serious charge remaining against them; that of
partiality. They unmistakably signify with whom they will agree and with
whom they will not. These are notably Clitocybe illudens, Lepiota
Morgani, Panæolus papilionaceus, all specialized in their places in the
text.

Other species have hereditary taints upon their reputations. Most, if
not all of them have stood present tests and relieved themselves of
suspicion. But, alas that it should be so! The stigma must rest upon
them for yet a while and until their defenders are so numerous that
their purity, without a smirch, is popularly proclaimed.

Wherever wood grows and decays as it will, Polyporus, Panus, Lenzites,
Schizophyllum and kindred genera stand prominently forth in countless
numbers. The great majority of them are inedible because of their woody
substance. A few are valued as food. Very many of them yield their
soluble matter and flavor when boiled, and in this way make excellent
soups and gravies, just as flax-seed and the bark of the slippery elm
yield succulent matter. These, however, are not, with a few exceptions,
mentioned in this book. Numbers of Clavarieæ and Hydneæ are in the same
category. M.C. Cooke tersely says: “Fruits that are not peaches or
apricots may be very good plums.” In the introductions to genera their
attributes are given; under “Instructions to Students” every guide to
identification and selection will be found.

A Glossary, containing the botanic terms used in this book and, it is
believed, all other terms used by mycologists in describing fungi,
follows the descriptive text. It is strongly advised that it be
carefully studied. The roots and derivatives of the botanic terms are
fully and carefully given by Dr. John W. Harshberger, professor of
botany, University of Pennsylvania, to whom the author is specially
indebted.

The excellent Glossary published by Dr. Edwin A. Daniels, Boston, has
furnished many comprehensive definitions. It is the property of the
Boston Mycological Club, and can be obtained from its secretary for
twenty-five cents.

The determination of the proper accentuation of the generic and specific
terms has been in many cases a difficult task, and, in some cases, owing
to the dubious origin of the words in question, there is certainly room
for difference of opinion. This task has been kindly and conscientiously
performed by Prof. M.W. Easton, professor of Comparative and English
Philology, University of Pennsylvania. Thanks are due to the Hon.
Addison Brown, president of the Torrey Botanical Club, and Dr. Nathaniel
L. Britton, professor of Botany in Columbia College, authors of
“Illustrated Flora,” for the determination of the accentuation of
non-classical words ending in _inus_.

Three indexes are given: the first refers to the general contents, the
second to the genera, the third to species and their genera,
alphabetically arranged.

Mrs. Emma P. Ewing and Mrs. Sarah T. Rorer have kindly furnished some of
their recipes for the preparation of several varieties of toadstools.
The best results of the author’s long experience in cooking toadstools
are given in the chapter “Recipes for Cooking and Preparing for the
Table,” together with others selected from many sources. The personal
taste of the server must be guide to the choice.

A child-friend of the writer, in telling him of her mother’s cook, said:
“She’s a good cooker, but she has a bad temper.” A good “cooker” will
soon learn how to best display the individual flavor of each species.
And be it known that each species of toadstool has a flavor of its own.
These flavors vary as much as among meats and vegetables. No one species
can be taken as standard of excellence.

The greatest care has been taken to secure illustrations correct in
every botanic detail. With few exceptions the colored figures were drawn
and painted by the writer. To obtain this important feature the
requirements of art have frequently been sacrificed. An artist can make
a picture of a toadstool; the mycologist must guide his brush or pencil
in the making of a correct presentation. The happy combination of artist
and mycologist occurs in Mr. Val. W. Starnes, Augusta, Ga., to whom this
volume owes many of its illustrations. Mr. Frank D. Briscoe, widely
known as an artist of rare ability, has arranged and painted in groups
the studies made by the writer from typical plants, and added to the
illustrations many excellent drawings of his own.

The unfailing reliability of the sun has been masterfully used by Dr.
J.R. Weist, ex-Secretary of the American Society of Surgeons, Richmond,
Ind.; H.I. Miller, Superintendent Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railroad,
Terre Haute, Ind., and Mr. Luther G. Harpel, Lebanon, Pa., in making the
unexcelled photographs generously contributed by them. The author is
most thankful to them and to Mr. C.G. Lloyd, Cincinnati, Ohio—a
scientific gentleman devoting lavishly of his time and money to the
spread of mycological knowledge—for the privilege of selecting from his
extensive collection of realistic photographs those adaptable to the
species described herein.

The author’s thanks are gratefully given to the many who have by help
and encouragement furthered his efforts in producing this, the first
American text-book upon fungi. Space precludes the naming of the many,
but the few named do not outrank them in their interest, help and the
author’s appreciation:

Miss Lydia M. Patchen, President of the Westfield, N.Y., Toadstool Club
(the first in America); Mrs. E.C. Anthony, Thomas J. Collins, E.B.
Sterling, Berry Benson, Melvil Dewey, New York State Librarian; Dr. J.E.
Schadle, Prof. J.P. Arnold, University of Pennsylvania; Prof. W.S.
Carter, University of Texas; Boston School of Natural History;
Massachusetts Horticultural Society; Prof. Wm. G. Farlow, University of
Harvard.

Thus aided the author believes that his own conscientious, patient,
loved labor in the study of edible and non-edible fungi and the
production of this volume will be far-reaching in its one
object—encouraging the study of toadstools.

The time for writing a complete flora of the United States has not yet
come; a large part of the country remains as yet unexplored by
mycologists; new species are being constantly discovered in the
districts best known. Every book on the subject must be necessarily
incomplete.

On the other hand, so far as concerns the known fungus-flora, there is
imperative need of some guide to the student, which shall at least save
him some part of the weary toil of hunting through the scattered
literature in which alone, as things are at present, can be found the
information he seeks. In this book I have tried to meet this need. It is
not complete, but I have tried to so arrange the matter that the student
can always decide whether the particular specimen in hand is or is not
included, and, at least for all of our more conspicuous fungi, determine
the family and genus. If the student can do so much, the task of finding
the specific name, even when not included in this book, becomes very
much simpler.

So much for the more scientific aspect of my book. But I have also kept
in constant view the needs of the large and constantly growing number of
persons who have no aim further than to learn to know the principal
toadstools seen in their walks, just as they wish to know the principal
trees and the more conspicuous birds. For such as these, the difficulty
of deciding whether or no a particular individual fungus is described in
the brief (sketching) manuals hitherto accessible is even more
formidable than with the special student of botany.

Finally, I have kept in view throughout the work the needs of the
mycophagists. They are not pot-hunters; they care much less for the
physical pleasure of the appetite than for the close study of Nature
that their inclination leads them into. Some day the delights of a
mushroom hunt along lush pastures and rich woodlands will take the rank
of the gentlest craft among those of hunting, and may perchance find its
own Izaak Walton.

                     AUTHOR’S AND PUBLISHER’S NOTE.

It is the intention of the author and the publisher to keep this book up
to date. Recognizing that future testing will prove many more species of
toadstools to be edible, and that scientists will have more exact
knowledge of toadstool poisons and their antidotes, they announce that
illustrated sheets publishing new edible species and current information
upon fungi will be, from time to time, issued, conforming in shape and
style to this volume and at an acceptable price.

That the author and publishers may keep in touch with the owner of each
volume, and be informed of new discoveries in species and of new
experience, owners are requested to communicate their book numbers to
Captain Charles McIlvaine, or the Bowen-Merrill Co., Indianapolis, Ind.




                        INSTRUCTIONS TO STUDENTS


To catch fish one must know more than the fish; to find toadstools one
must know their season and habitats. They are propagated by their spores
and from their mycelium—that web-like growth which is the result of
spore germination.

The spores of ground-growing kinds, when shed upon the ground, are
washed by rains along the natural drainage; therefore, when a specimen
of one of these kinds is found, it is well to look up and down the
natural water-shed, and follow it. Good reward will usually come of it.
Few fungi are strictly solitary.

Careful observation of the habitats of the various genera and species
will enable the student to know what may and may not be expected in a
particular locality, and will save many a hunt.

When an unknown species is found, collect it carefully, examine it
closely, note all its features. Determine to which division of fungi it
belongs. If to the gilled family (Agaricaceæ) obtain the color of the
spores (see directions). Look at the chart “Tabular View of Genera of
Agaricaceæ,” Plate I, p. 2 (after W.G. Smith, but enlarged, redrawn and
emended). If the spores are white, it belongs to one of the genera in
the first column—Leucosporæ; if pink, to one in the second column, and
so on. It is often difficult to determine the spore color, because
spores vary through many shades of the typical color. What are called
white spores may be creamy, dirty, yellowish or brownish-white; pink
spores will vary from almost white to reddish and salmon-color; brown
spores from light-ochraceous through cinnamon to rusty; purple spores
from dark-violet to purplish-black. Experience alone will enable the
student to decide which color series is present. The Genera Charts,
preceding the five different color series, show typical spore colors
only. Again, authors describing the species frequently fail to see
colors alike; if they do, their names for them frequently vary. For
instance, few persons will agree upon a color expressed as “livid.”

The color system principally used by botanists is Saccardo’s
“Chromotaxia,” costing fifty cents. It is decidedly inadequate.
Ridgway’s “Nomenclature of Colors for Naturalists” is far better, but it
is out of print and obtainable only at the principal libraries. “The
Prang Standard of Color” is the most complete ever issued, but it is
inapplicable to existing descriptions of fungi.

[Sidenote: Make and Preserve Spore Prints.]

Take, to print upon, sheets of Bristol-board or any stiff, hard-surfaced
white paper 6×9 inches or larger. Cut a round hole, four inches in
diameter, in one of the sheets. Use this as a stencil. Lay it upon a
print-sheet and where the opening occurs, paint with a weak solution of
gum arabic—⅛ oz. (one teaspoonful) to one pint of water. Dry the
print-sheets.

When a spore-print is to be taken, select a fully-grown specimen, remove
the stem, place the spore-bearing surface upon the gummed paper, cover
tightly with an inverted bowl or saucer, and allow to stand undisturbed
for eight or ten hours. The moisture in the plant will soften the gummed
surface; the spores will be shed and will adhere to it, making a
perfect, permanent print. When the print is plain, remove the specimen
carefully and dry the print. Number the print-cards to correspond with
the number of the specimen in the “Record of Fungi,” and place them in a
box or cover. Some genera shed their spores sooner and more freely than
others. A surplus of spores is objectionable. In order to know when a
print is plainly made, without disturbing the process, have either a
specimen of the same age, or a piece of the one under the bowl, on
another piece of gummed paper, covered in like manner. This can be
examined and will give the desired information. A little experience will
enable the student to obtain good and lasting prints.

The large black figures on some calendars, if cut with the white about
them, are convenient as trial sheets for spore-printing. Lay the
specimen partly on the white, partly on the black. If the spores are
light, they show best on black ground, and if colored, they show best on
the light.

Spore measurements, as given by different observers, vary to such a
degree that they are of little value, excepting as determining a few
species, but spore shapes and characteristics are of use as a last
resort, in accurate determinations. A microscope of considerable power
is needed.

A metrical scale and table of measures is here given, that the student
may have a present guide to such measurements as are given in
mycological publications.

[Sidenote: Use of Charts of Genera.]

The spore color being determined, turn to the Genera Chart, showing
spores of like color. Ascertain from the specimen whether or not its cap
or hymenophore is distinct or easily separable from the stem and the
gills free from the stem; if they are, it may belong to one of the
genera in the upper row of figures; if the cap is not easily separable
nor the gills free, look at the shape of the gills, and find on the
chart a corresponding gill-shape. It is probable that the genus can thus
be determined. Then turn to this genus in the text, read the heading,
look over the “Analysis of Tribes,” go to the tribe nearest in
designating the properties of the specimen; comparing the specimen with
the descriptions of species given thereunder, will probably enable the
seeker to decide upon its name.

It should be remembered that the descriptions in the text are of the
specimen or specimens which the author of the species saw. What the
author says fixes the type of the species. Specimens of the species may,
and very frequently do, vary greatly from the type. If the first attempt
to fix the genus is not satisfactory, try again, and keep on trying
until reasonably sure. The amateur will find, however good an opinion
may exist in his mind of the stock of patience on hand, that the
territory of patience has just been reached.

[Sidenote: Making and Preserving Notes.]

An excellent blank form for “Collectors’ Notes” is published by the
Boston Mycological Club, at one cent. It is desirable that there should
be uniformity in collectors’ notes, and that they should be as full as
possible. A form of this, or a similar kind, should be filled in and
kept, and should also be used when specimens are sent to an expert for
identification. Such specimens should be fresh, wrapped separately in
tissue paper, numbered, and _a few_ should be packed in a box that will
_not crush in the mail_. The address of the sender should be upon the
outside. The collector’s notes should be sent in a letter, with a
postage stamp for reply enclosed. If the specimens have to go a great
distance, they should be partially dried in a slow, open oven, or they
will be a rotten mass when they reach their destination.

[Sidenote: To Test Edibility of Species.]

There is but one way by which to determine the edibility of a species.
If it looks and smells inviting, and its species can not be determined,
taste a very small piece. Do not swallow it. Note the effect on the
tongue and mouth. But many species, delicious when cooked, are not
inviting raw. Cook a small piece; do not season it. Taste again; if
agreeable eat it (unless it is an Amanita). After several hours, no
unpleasant effect arising, cook a larger piece, and increase the
quantity until fully satisfied as to its qualities. Never vary from this
system, no matter how much tempted. No possible danger can arise from
adhering firmly to it. Recipes for preparing, cooking and serving are
given in chapter on cooking.

It is better for the student to first become familiar with the common
species, one at a time, than to attempt tracing the rare or many. Worry,
fatigue and uncertainty are plentiful in an indiscriminate gathering of
fungi. One species a day, properly traced and named, means learning
three hundred and sixty-five species a year.

[Sidenote: The Glossary.]

Unfamiliar terms will be encountered in the descriptive text. The
Glossary defines them; and not only those in this book, but, it is
believed, all those found in other books upon fungi. Where possible
throughout the text, botanical terms have been anglicized. The meanings
of those remaining unchanged should be memorized. It is quite as easy,
and far better, to learn the botanical names of species and their
characteristics, as to learn their common names; easier in fact, for the
common names often vary with locality. The writer received a letter from
an Alsatian living in St. Louis, telling him of favorite fungi he used
to eat when in his own country. To all he gave local names, not one of
which could be referred to the particular species meant.

Success and pleasure in the study of fungi will attend the student who
observes carefully and who systematically records that which is
observed.

                              CLASS, FUNGI

                               ----------

                        SUB-CLASS BASIDIOMYCETES

COHORT _HYMENOMYCETES_. _Gr._—a membrane, a fruit-bearing surface;
  _Gr._—a mushroom. (So called from the hymenium or fruit-bearing
  surface.)


Fungi composed of membranes, fleshy, woody or gelatinous, growing on
wood or on the ground. The hymenium or spore-bearing surface exposed at
an early stage. The spores are borne on basidia, spread over the
surface. The common mushroom is typical of the family. All the members
resemble it, more or less, in organization and reproductive organs.
These latter, in the mushroom, are spread over lamellæ or gills. The
spores, after ripening and dissemination, germinate and produce a
mycelium or thread-like vine, which in turn develops the spore-producing
part of the plant. Hymenomycetes is divided into the following six
Families:—

                        _a._ HYMENIUM FIGURATE.

     I. Spread over the surface of lamellæ or             AGARICACEÆ.
        gills.

    II. Lining the interior of tubes or pores.           POLYPORACEÆ.

   III. Clothing the surface of spines or                   HYDNACEÆ.
        protuberances      of various forms.

                          _b._ HYMENIUM EVEN.

    IV. Horizontal and mostly on the under             THELEPHORACEÆ.
        surface.

     V. Vertical and produced all over the               CLAVARIACEÆ.
        surface.

    VI. Superior, gelatinous fungi.                      TREMELLACEÆ.


                        FAMILY I.—=AGARICACEÆ.=

In the Agaricaceæ the hymenium is spread over lamellæ or gills which
radiate from a center or stem. The gills are composed of a double
membrane, and are simple or branched.

The parts of an Agaric may all be present as in Amanitæ, or severally
absent in other genera. When the young fungus is entirely enclosed in a
wrapper or case, this case is called the _universal veil_. When this
veil is ruptured by the growth of the stem, that part which remains
attached to the base is called the _volva_. The membrane reaching from
the stem to the margin of the cap is the _partial veil_; when it
ruptures by the expansion of the cap and all or a portion adheres to and
about the stem it forms the _annulus or ring_. In some species one or
both veils may be present, or one or both may be absent.

The stem is _central_ when supporting the cap at its center; _excentric_
when at one side of the center; _lateral_ when it supports the cap from
the side. If the stem is absent, the cap is said to be _sessile_; if the
cap is horizontal and supported by a broad base it is _dimidiate_; if
attached to its place of growth by its back it is _resupinate_.

Genera are largely distinguished by the manner in which the gills are
attached to the stem. These distinguishing attachments are shown in the
plates illustrating genera and in Plate IV. Gill-shapes.

For convenience Agaricaceæ is divided by the color of the spores into
five series: white, pink, brown, purple, black. The last two, owing to
the similarity of hue, are by some writers (preferably) included in the
black-spored series. Spore color is a valuable assistant in determining
species.




           _Series I._ =LEUCOSPORÆ.= _Gr._—white; _Gr._—seed.

Spores white, rarely dingy or inclining to reddish. In the genus Russula
the spores of some species are white, in some cream-color, and in
several pale ochraceous. Variations from pure white are found in the
spores of Tricholoma personatum and a few other species. Gill-color is
not a guide to spore-color. Purple, yellow, brown, pinkish gills may
produce white spores.

                               =AMANITA.=

      (A name given to some esculent fungi by Galen, perhaps from
                             Mount Amanus.)


Universal veil (volva), which is at first continuous (completely
enveloping the young plant), distinct from the skin of the cap.
Hymenophore or cap, the part which bears the spore-bearing surface,
distinct and easily separable from the stem, which leaves a socket in
the flesh when it is removed. _All growing upon the ground._ _Fries._

                              (Plate VII.)

[Illustration: SECTION OF AMANITA PHALLOIDES.]

=Pileus= somewhat fleshy, convex then expanded. =Gills= free. Universal
veil at first enclosing the entire plant, which as it grows bursts
through, generally carrying the upper part on the pileus, where it
appears as patches or scales, the remainder enclosing the stem at the
base as a volva, either in a cup-like form, closely adherent or friable
and evanescent. The partial veil in youth extends from the stem to the
margin of the pileus, enclosing the gills; when ruptured it depends from
the stem as a ring. =Stem= furnished with a ring, and different in
substance from that of the pileus. =Spores= white.

On the ground.

The nearest allied genus, Amanitopsis, is separated by the absence of a
ring, and Lepiota by its lack of a volva; Volvaria, Acetabularia and
Chitonia, possessing volvas, are distinguished by the color of their
spores.

Amanitæ are the most beautiful and conspicuous of fungi. While there are
comparatively few species of them, the individual members are plentiful
in appearing from spring until the coming of frost. They are solitary or
gregarious in growth. Occasionally two or three are found together. They
frequent woods, groves, copse, margins of woods and land recently
cleared of trees. They are seldom found in open fields. A careful study
of all their botanic points should be the first duty of the student of
fungi. Familiarity with every characteristic of the Amanitæ will insure
against fatal toadstool poisoning, for it is the well-grounded belief of
those who have made thorough investigation that, with the exception of
Helvella esculenta, now Gyromitra esculenta, the Amanitæ, alone, contain
deadly poisons.

_No Amanita, or piece of one, should be eaten before its identity is
fully established and its qualities ascertained by referring to the
descriptions herein given or to the opinion of an expert._

They are the aristocrats of fungi. Their noble bearing, their beauty,
their power for good or evil, and above all their perfect structure,
have placed them first in their realm; and they proudly bear the three
badges of their clan and rank—the volva or sheath from which they
spring, the kid-like apron encircling their waists, and patch-marks of
their high birth upon their caps. In their youth, when in or just
appearing above the ground, they are completely invested with a membrane
or universal veil, which is distinct and free from the skin of the cap.
As the plant grows the membrane stretches and finally bursts. It
sometimes ruptures in one place only and remains about the base of the
stem as the volva. When such a rupture occurs the caps are smooth. In
most species portions of the volva remain upon the cap as scruff or
warts—pointed or rough—or as feathery adornment; any or all of which may
in part or whole vanish with age or be washed away by rain.

Extending from the stem to the margin of the cap, and covering the
gills, is the partial =veil=—a membranaceous, white texture of varying
thickness. As the cap expands this veil tears from it. Portions
frequently remain pendant from the edges, the rest contracts to the stem
as a ring, or droops from it as a surrounding ruffle, or, if of slight
consistency, may be fugacious and disappear, but marks, remains, or the
veil itself will always be traceable upon the stem.

The Amanitæ are of all colors, from the brilliant orange of the A.
Cæsarea, the rich scarlet or crimson of the A. muscaria, to the pure
white of the A. phalloides in its white form.

Their stems are usually long, and taper from the base toward the top. In
some forms the base is distinctly bulbous. The =volva= at the base is
attached to the stem at its lower extremity. It may be visible as a cup
or ruptured pouch with spreading mouth, or it may be of such friable
texture as to appear like mealy scales. Often, when the plant is pulled
from the ground, the volva remains, but the marks of its attachment will
appear and should be carefully looked for. Their =gills= are commonly
white, are of equal length and radiate from near the stem, which they do
not reach, to the circumference of the cap. They are white, unless
tinged with age, excepting upon A. Cæsarea and A. Frostiana where they
are yellow.[B] Their caps are umbrella-shaped, flat or convex. Their
flesh is white, does not change color when bruised. They are scentless
and almost tasteless when fresh, when old they have a slightly offensive
odor and taste.

Footnote B:

  A. Frostiana is not always yellow gilled.

The family is not a large one, not over thirty members complete its
circle. Every feature, every part of its several members, should be
thoroughly known before the intimacy of eating. While at least nine of
the family are not only edible but delicate and sapid, far better will
it be to leave all alone than to make a mistake. A piece of a poisonous
variety the size of a dime will often cause serious disorders if eaten.
Many persons have died from eating very small quantities.

Because of its ovate or button-like form when young, it is frequently
mistaken for the common field mushroom; even experienced mycophagists
have been deceived by it. No other poison has so puzzled scientists.
Other varieties of fungi may interfere with digestion, but to the
Amanitæ all deaths from toadstool-eating are traceable. Its subtle
alkaloid is absorbed by the system, and in most cases lies unsuspected
for from six to twelve hours, then its iron grip holds to the death. For
centuries it has defied all remedies. The problem has been partially
solved. At Shenandoah, Pa., August 31, 1885, a family of five were
poisoned by toadstools; two died, three lived. Noting the sad account in
the newspapers, I at once wrote to Shenandoah for specimens of the fungi
eaten and a description of the treatment. I promptly received from Dr.
J.E. Schadle (now Professor Schadle), the physician in charge of the
cases, a box containing two harmless varieties and several fine
specimens of the Amanita phalloides, all of which were gathered on the
same spot and by the same person who gathered the toadstools doing the
poisoning. They told the tale. A remarkably full and interesting account
of the cases was sent to me by Dr. Schadle. After exhausting all other
remedies, and after two of the five had died, he administered
subcutaneously, by hypodermic injection, sulphate of atropine—a product
of the deadly nightshade analagous to belladonna—1⁄180 to 1⁄60 of a
grain at a dose. It proved to be an antidote and saved the lives of the
remaining three.

The action of atropine in arresting the deadly work of poisoning by
amanitine had been foreshadowed by Schmidberg and Koppe, and dwelt upon
in numerous published articles by Mr. Julius A. Palmer, to whom more
than any other is due the branding of the murderous members of the
Amanita family; but for the first time atropine was used upon the human
system to ward their blows.

All of the species herein described are found in the United States. Of
the twenty-seven, nine are edible, nine are either known to be deadly or
are so closely allied to deadly species that it is unsafe to class them
as other than poisonous until absolute proof is obtained of their
harmlessness. The remaining nine I have not seen, neither is there any
record of their qualities.

                          ANALYSIS OF SPECIES.

* Volva opening at the top or splitting all around, leaving a manifest,
free border at the base of the stem. Pileus naked or with broad
membranaceous patches.

** Volva splitting regularly all round the lower portion, persistent,
more or less closely embracing the base of the bulbous stem. The upper
portion being adnate to the pileus appears on it by expansion as
scattered, thick warts.

*** Volva friable, entirely broken up into wart-like scales, therefore
not persistent at the base of the stem, which is at first
globose-bulbous, becoming less so as it lengthens. Pileus bearing mealy
patches, soon disappearing or with small, hard, pointed warts.

**** Volva rudimentary, flocculose, wholly disappearing.


                    * _Volva bursting at top, etc._


=A. viro´sa= Fr.—_virus_, poison.

Shining white. =Pileus= 3–4 in. broad, fleshy, _at first conical and
acute_, afterwards bell-shaped, then expanded, naked, viscous in wet
weather, shining when dry, _margin_ always even, but most frequently
_unequal_, turned backward and inflexed. =Flesh= white, unchangeable.
=Stem= 4–6 in. long, _wholly stuffed_, almost solid, split up into
longitudinal fibrils, cylindrical from the bulbous base, often
compressed at the apex, _torn into scales_ on the surface, springing
from a _lax, wide, thick volva_, which bursts open at the apex. =Ring=
close to the top, lax, silky, splitting up into floccose fragments.
=Gills= free, thin, narrow, narrowing at both ends, but a little broader
in front, not decurrent on the stem (although the apex of the stem is
often striate), crowded, somewhat floccose at the edge. _Fries._

The pilei are most frequently oblique, extended and lobed on one side as
in Hygrophorous conicus, scarcely ever depressed. The pileus rarely
becomes yellow. The fragments of the veil often adhere to the edge of
the gills.

=Pileus= 3–4 in. broad, commonly shining white or lemon-yellow, fleshy,
oval bell-shaped, then expanded, _obtuse_, covered over with a pellicle
which is _viscid_ (not glutinous) in wet weather, naked, rarely
sprinkled with one or two fragments of the volva, the _regular margin
even_. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, ½ in. and more thick, solid downward,
bulbous, hollow and attenuated upward, _rather smooth_, white. =Ring=
_superior_, reflexed, slightly striate, swollen, commonly entire, white.
=Volva= more or less buried in the soil, bulbous, _semifree_, bursting
open in a torn manner at the apex, with a lax border. =Gills= free,
ventricose, 4 lines broad, shining white. _Fries._

=Pileus= very variable in color, commonly white or yellow (A. citrina
Pers.), becoming green (A. viridis Pers.), olivaceous and occasionally
variegated with tiger spots; in late autumn with the disk almost black
but whitish round the margin. Odor somewhat fetid, but little remarkable
as compared with that of A. virosa.

In woods. Frequent. August to November.

A very POISONOUS and dangerous species. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 8–9µ _W.G.S._; 8–10µ _B._; 7–9µ diam. _Massee_; globose, 7.6×6µ
_Peck_.

=Pileus= at first ovate or subcampanulate, then expanded, slightly
viscid when young and moist, smooth or rarely adorned by a few fragments
of the volva, _even on the margin_, white, yellowish-brown or
blackish-brown. =Lamellæ= rather broad, rounded behind, free, white.
Stem equal or slightly tapering upward, stuffed or hollow, smooth or
slightly floccose, ringed, _bulbous_, the ruptured volva either
appressed loose or merely forming a narrow margin to the bulb.

=Plant= 4–8 in. high. =Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 3–6 lines thick.

This species is common and variable. It occurs everywhere in woods and
assumes such different colors that the inexperienced mycologist is apt
to mistake its different forms for distinct species. With us the
prevailing colors of the pileus are white, yellowish-white,
grayish-brown and blackish-brown. It is remarkable that the form with a
greenish pileus, which seems to be common enough in Europe, does not
occur here. Fries also mentions a form having a white pileus with a
black disk. A somewhat similar form occurs here, in which the pileus is
grayish-brown with a black disk. Some of the variously colored forms
were formerly taken to be distinct species, in consequence of which
several synonyms have arisen, of which A. virescens Fl. Dan., Amanita
viridis Pers., and Amanita citrina Pers., are examples. A. verna Bull.
is a variety having a white pileus, a rather thick annulus and an
appressed volva. It sometimes occurs early in the season; hence the
specific name. It also occurs late in the season and runs into the
typical form so that it is not easy to keep it distinct. The flesh and
the lamellæ are white, the stem is white, pallid or brownish, and the
annulus is either white or brownish. The bulb is generally very broad
and abrupt or depressed, though it sometimes is small and approaches an
ovate form. The large bulbs are sometimes split externally in two or
three places and are, therefore, two- or three-lobed. In such cases the
volva is less persistent than usual and its free portion then furnishes
merely an acute edge or narrow margin to the bulb. Specimens sometimes
occur in which the margin of the pileus is narrowly adorned with a
slight woolly hairiness, but usually it is perfectly smooth and even. By
this character, taken in connection with the membranous volva and
bulbous base of the stem, the species is readily distinguished.
Sometimes a strong odor is emitted by it, but usually the odor is
slight. Authors generally pronounce this a poisonous and very dangerous
species. Its appearance is attractive, but its use as food is to be
avoided. _Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Common in woods and recently cleared woodlands. Frequent over the United
States. June to frost.

An exceedingly _poisonous, dangerous_, seductive species, responsible
for most of the deaths from toadstool eating; because in its white form
it is mistaken for the common mushroom—Agaricus campester. The real
fault is with the collector, who should never eat any fungus found in
the woods, believing it to be the mushroom. The mushroom does not grow
in the woods. Neither has it _white gills_, nor _white spores_, nor a
_volva_ at the base of the stem as have Amanitæ.

The caps of A. phalloides vary in color—white, oyster-color, smoky
brown. The color of the commonest form is from white to a light hue of
greenish yellow. The center of the cap, whatever may be the prevailing
color, is usually several shades darker. In shape, the cap changes from
a knob in youth, through the shapes of expansion, until it becomes fully
spread, when it is umbrella-shaped, or almost flat. Some forms have a
slightly raised portion or umbo in the center of the cap. The gills are
white, of good width, rounded next to the stem and free from it.

The stem conforms in color to the cap, but in lighter shades.
White-capped varieties have white stems. The stem has a sudden broad,
distinct bulb at the base. On the upper side of the bulb there is
usually a margin or rim. The stem tapers more or less toward the cap,
from which it is easily separable. The cup, wrapper or volva is torn or
split or irregular at the upper part, and is not pressed to the stem as
in some forms.

Professor Peck, in his 48th Report, gives the following excellent
synopsis of differences between the poisonous Amanita and edible fungi,
for which it could only by great stupidity be mistaken:

_Poison amanita._ =Gills= persistently white. =Stem= equal to or longer
than the diameter of the cap, with a broad, distinct bulb at the base.

_Common mushroom._ =Gills= pink, becoming blackish-brown. =Stem= shorter
than the diameter of the cap, with no bulb at the base.

From all forms of the edible Sheathed amanitopsis the Poison amanita
differs in its distinctly bulbous stem, in having a collar on the stem
and in the absence of striations on the margin of the cap.

From the edible Reddish amanita, it is easily separated by the entire
absence of any reddish hues or stains and of warts upon its cap.

From the Smooth lepiota its distinct, abrupt and marginal bulb at once
distinguishes it.


=A. ver´na= Bull.—_vernus_, of spring. A variety of A. phalloides.
POISONOUS. White. =Pileus= ovate then expanded, somewhat depressed,
viscid, margin orbicular, even. =Stem= stuffed then hollow, equal,
floccose, closely sheathed with the free border of the volva. =Ring=
reflexed, swollen. =Gills= free. =Pileus= glabrous, even on the margin,
white, viscid when moist. =Gills= white. =Stem= ringed, white, floccose,
stuffed or hollow, closely sheathed at the base by the remains of the
membranous volva, bulbous. =Spores= globose, 8µ broad.

In woods. Spring and summer.

The Vernal Amanita scarcely differs from white forms of the A.
phalloides except in the more persistent and more closely sheathing
remains of the wrapper at the base of the stem. It is probably only a
variety of that species, as most mycologists now regard it, and it
should be considered quite as dangerous. I have not found it earlier
than in July, although in Europe it is said to appear in spring, as its
name implies. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Common over the United States. West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
May to November. It appeared at Mt. Gretna, Pa., on May 28, 1899.
_McIlvaine._

The absence of a ring separates white forms of A. volvata and A.
vaginata.

The virulence of its poison is the same as that of A. phalloides.


=A. magnivela´ris= Pk.—_magnus_, large; _velum_, veil. =Pileus= convex
or nearly plane, glabrous, slightly viscid when moist, even on the
margin, white or yellowish-white. =Gills= close, free, white. =Stem=
long, nearly equal, glabrous, white, furnished with a large membranous
white annulus, sheathed at the base by the appressed remains of the
membranous volva, the bulbous base tapering downward and radicating.
=Spores= broadly elliptical, 10×6–8µ.

=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 5–7 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Solitary in woods. Port Jefferson, Suffolk county. July.

The species resembles Amanita verna, from which it is separated by its
large persistent annulus, the elongated downwardly tapering bulb of its
stem, and especially by its elliptical spores. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

I have not seen this species. Its resemblance to A. verna is enough to
place the ban upon it until it has been tested.


=A. map´pa= Fr.—_mappa_, a napkin. From the volva. =Pileus= 2–3 in.
broad, commonly white or becoming yellow, slightly fleshy,
convexo-plane, obtuse or depressed, orbicular, _dry_, margin for the
most part even. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3–5 lines thick, stuffed then
hollow, almost equal above the bulb, rather smooth, white. =Ring=
superior, soft, lax, here and there torn. =Volva= regularly _circularly
split_, somewhat obliterated; the globoso-bulbous base united with the
stem, with an acute and distant margin; the portion covering the pileus
divided into broad, irregular, somewhat separating scales. =Gills=
annexed, crowded, narrow, shining, white. _Fries._

=Odor= stinking. The color is that of A. phalloides, with which A.
virosa exactly agrees, more rarely straw color, lemon-yellow, becoming
green.

In mixed woods. Frequent. _Stevenson._

=Spores= spheroid, 7–10µ _K._; 8–9×6–8µ _B._; subglobose, 7–9µ diameter
_Massee_.

New York woods and fields, common, September to October, _Peck_, 22d
Rep.; North Carolina, _Curtis_; New England, _Frost_; Minnesota,
_Johnson_; Ohio, _Morgan_; District Columbia, _Miss Taylor_.

POISONOUS.

Probably but a variety of A. phalloides.


=A. spre´ta= Pk.—_spreta_, hated. (Plate VI, fig. 1, p. 6.) =Pileus=
subovate, then convex or expanded, smooth or adorned with a few
fragments of the volva, substriate on the margin, whitish or pale-brown.
=Gills= close, reaching the stem, white. =Stem= equal, smooth, annulate,
stuffed or hollow, whitish, finely striate at the top from the decurrent
lines of the lamellæ, not bulbous at the base, but the volva rather
large, loose, subochreate. =Spores= elliptical, generally with a single
large nucleus, 10–13×6–8µ.

=Plant= 4–6 in. high. =Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 4–6 lines thick.

Ground in open places. Sandlake and Gansevoort. August. _Peck_, 32d Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

This is a dangerous species, because containing a deadly poison and
resembling the most common forms of Amanitopsis, therefore likely to be
mistaken for them. Specimens sent by me to Professor Peck were
identified as his species. I add my own description.

=Pileus= oval, broadly umbonate, date-brown toward and on umbo, soft,
dry, smooth, more or less sulcate on edge. =Flesh= white, thin, except
at center. =Stem= tapers rapidly above ring and at base,
white-reddish-brown toward middle, narrows toward volva from which it is
almost free at the base, hollow, furfuraceous above ring. =Gills= white,
crowded, free. =Ring= white, thin, persistent, but at times hard to
distinguish because clinging to stem. =Volva= free, fitting close, upper
margin thin, lower part quite thick, making stem appear bulbous, which
it is not. White forms occur.

Not as virulent as A. phalloides, but like it in its POISONOUS effects.
It differs from Amanitopsis in having a ring.

Grows in woods and on wood-margins.

Angora woods, West Philadelphia. On ground in mixed woods, open and
grassy places in wood and wood-margins. August to September.
_McIlvaine._


=A. recuti´ta= Fr.—having a fresh or new skin. =Pileus= convex then
plane, _dry_, smooth, frequently bearing fragments of the volva, margin
nearly even. =Stem= stuffed then hollow, attenuated, _silky_, volva
circumscissile, becoming obliterated, margin closely pressed to stem;
ring distant, white. =Gills= striate-decurrent.

In pine woods. Common.

No report upon quality.


=A. Cæsa´rea= Scop.—king-like. (Called by the Greeks _Cibus Deorum_,
food of the gods.) CAUTION. =Pileus= 3–8 in. across, hemispherical, then
expanded, free from warts, distinctly striate on the margin, red or
orange becoming yellow. =Gills= free, yellow. =Stem= 4–6 in. long, up to
¾ in. thick at base, slightly tapering upward, yellowish, flocculose,
stuffed with white fibrils or hollow, with a conspicuous yellowish ring
or veil. =Volva= white, large, distinct and membranous. =Spores=
elliptical, 8–10µ _Peck_.

Open woods, under pines on lawns. July to October.

Reported from North Carolina, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Maryland,
New Jersey, Ohio, Alabama, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New York. _Peck_,
Rep. 23, 32, 33, 48.

This emperor of fungi is the most showy of its race. It grows to 10 in.
in height. The cap reaches 8 in. in diameter and the stem over 1½ in. in
thickness. In very much smaller specimens about the same proportions
occur. The cap is at first ovate, then hemispherical, then expanded. It
has no warts or scales upon it. The margin is distinctly striate. The
flesh is white, yellow or reddish under the skin; next to the gills it
is usually yellow.

The stem tapers upward from the socket at its base. It is yellowish and
covered with loose fibrils of darker hue. The ring is white, but
frequently tinged with yellow. In taste and smell it is mild. Open woods
is its favorite habitat, yet it is found growing luxuriantly under
pines, maples, elms, on lawns. It is not often found, but when it is, it
is solitary, or in groups or rings. In the latitude of Philadelphia it
is found from July until October 1st. Further south its stay conforms to
temperature, and it is more frequent. There is no doubt of its rare
edibility abroad, and of its being eaten in America.

A specimen believed to be it should never be eaten until carefully
distinguished from A. muscaria and A. Frostiana, which have warts or
scales on the cap (which sometimes are not discernible after rain),
white gills, and a volva which soon breaks up into fragments or scabs.

Appearing like a small form of A. muscaria, to which it was formerly
referred, is A. Frostiana Pk. (Frost’s Agaric). It closely resembles
small A. Cæsarea, especially in the yellow tinge of stem, ring and
gills. The volva and ring (persistent in A. Cæsarea) soon disappear, but
are traceable by fluffy fragments, or yellow stains. It is extremely
poisonous.

The differences, concisely, are these: A. Cæsarea (Orange Amanita).
=Cap= smooth, though occasionally with a few fragments of the volva as
patches upon it. =Gills= yellow. =Stem= yellow. =Volva= usually
persistent, sometimes breaking up into soft, fluffy masses.

_A. muscaria_ (Fly Amanita). Poisonous. =Cap= covered with remains of
the volva as scales or wart-like patches. =Gills= white. =Stem= white or
light-yellow. =Volva= not persistent, breaking up into fluffy fragments
or scales.

_A. Frostiana._ Poisonous. Smaller and more delicate than the two
preceding. =Cap= smooth or with yellow scales or wart-like patches.
=Gills= yellow or tinged on edge with yellow. =Stem= white or yellow,
the ring evanescent, but always leaving a yellow mark on stem. =Volva=
yellow, breaking up into yellow fluffy fragments.

Far better for the amateur to let the A. Cæsarea, and anything
resembling it, respectfully alone.

New York, _Gansvoort_. Circle forty feet in diameter. _Peck_, 32d Rep.;
Maryland. There is not a doubt that this fungus can be eaten with
impunity, _Banning_; Alabama, abundant. Edible. Alabama Bull. No. 80.

Rogues and Cordier, French writers, regard it as the finest and most
delicate of fungi, the perfume and taste being exquisite.

The writer has not had opportunity to eat A. Cæsarea. If such should
occur he would go about it very cautiously. No suspicion attaches to it
abroad, but evidence is accumulating in the hands of the writer (not yet
convincing) that either locality may render it poisonous or that A.
muscaria varies so much in appearance as to deceive even the expert into
mistaking it for A. Cæsarea. It is possible that A. muscaria is, at
times, in certain localities, harmless; but no such exception as this is
noted in the entire fungoid realm. It is not so common that collectors
should mourn its waste. It is better, far, to let it alone.


 ** _Volva splitting regularly all around; pileus bearing thick warts,
                                 etc._


=A. musca´ria= Linn.—_musca_, a fly. (Plate VI, fig. 4, p. 6. Plate IX.)
POISONOUS. =Pileus= 4 in. and more broad, normally at first blood-red,
soon orange and becoming pale, whitening when old, globose, then convex
and at length flattened, covered with a _pellicle_ which is _at first
thick_, and in wet weather _glutinous_, but which gradually disappears,
and sprinkled with thick, angular, separating fragments of the volva;
_margin_ when full-grown _slightly striate_. =Flesh= not compact, white,
_yellow under the pellicle_. =Stem= as much as a span long, shining
white, firm, torn into scales, at first stuffed with lax, spider-web
fibrils, soon _hollow_; the _adnate base of the volva_ forms an ovate
bulb, which is _marginate with concentric scales_. =Ring= very soft,
torn, even, inserted at the apex of the stem, which is often dilated.
=Gills= free, but reaching the stem, decurrent in the form of lines,
crowded, broader in front, white, rarely becoming yellow.

Var. _rega´lis_, twice as large. =Stem= stuffed, _solid when young_, as
much as 1–2 in. thick, becoming light-yellow within; the volva
terminates in 8–10 concentric squamoso-reflexed rows of scales. =Pileus=
very glutinous, bay-brown or the color of cooked liver. =Gills=
yellowish.

Var. _formo´sa_, soft, fragile. =Pileus= at first _lemon-yellow_, with
mealy, lax, yellowish, easily-separating warts, often naked. =Gills=
often becoming yellow. A. formosa, with the warts rubbed off.

Var. _umbri´na_, thinner and _more slender_. =Stem= hollow, often
twisted, bulb narrowed. =Pileus= at first _umber_, then livid, with the
exception of the disk, which is dingy-brown. =Gills= at length remote.
_Stev._

=Pileus= at first ovate or hemispherical, then broadly convex or nearly
plane, slightly viscid when young and moist, _rough with numerous_
_whitish or yellowish warts_, rarely smooth, narrowly and _slightly
striate on the margin_, white, yellow or orange-red. =Gills= white.
=Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward, stuffed with webby fibrils or
hollow, bearing a white ring above, _ovate-bulbous_ at the base, white
or yellowish; the volva usually breaking up into scales and adhering to
the upper part of the bulb and the base of the stem. =Spores=
_elliptical_, 8–10x6–8µ.

=Plant= 5–8 in. high. =Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. _Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

A white variety, with the pileus thickly studded with sharp warts,
occurs in Albany Rural Cemetery. July. _Peck_, 24th Rep.

Var. _al´ba_ Pk. It also occurs on Long Island in two forms, the normal
one and a smaller one, in which the warts of the pileus are evanescent
or wanting. Not unfrequently it makes a close approach to white forms of
A. pantherina, in having the upper part of the bulb uniformly margined
by the remains of the definitely circumscissile volva, but this margin
is more acute than in that species. _Peck_, 46th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= spheroid-ellipsoid, 10–12x8–9µ _K._; 6x9µ, _W.G.S._;
elliptical, 8–10x6–8µ _Peck_.

“At Cincinnati, yellow A. muscaria are all we find.” _Lloyd._

Reported from most of the states. At Mt. Gretna I found it in great
quantity, and frequently three or four tightly crowded together. Many
pounds of it were sent to Professor Chittenden, Sheffield Laboratory,
Yale University. Near Haddonfield, N.J., large patches annually grow
under pines, gorgeous in their rich orange-red caps, usually scaly, with
at times lemon-yellow in the same clusters, smooth as A. Cæsarea. It
grows from July until after hard frosts.

It is undoubtedly _poisonous_ to a high degree. Its juices in minute
quantity, carefully and scientifically injected into the circulation of
etherized cats, kill in less than a minute. A raw piece of the cap, the
size of a hazel nut, affects me sensibly if taken on an empty stomach.
Dizziness, nausea, exaggeration of vision and pallor result from it. The
pulse quickens and is full, and a dreaded pressure affects the
breathing. I have not noticed change in the pupil of the eye. Nicotine
from smoking a pipe with me abates the symptoms, which entirely
disappear in two hours, leaving as reminiscence a torturing, dull,
skull-pervading headache. If, as is asserted on good authority, the
Siberians use it as an intoxicant, they certainly suffer the accustomed
penalty. It is possible that persons may, in a degree, become immune to
its poison, as they do to arsenic, strychnia, opium, nicotine, or it may
be that a portion of the poison is extracted by boiling. It is, however,
extremely dangerous to rely upon extracting by any means the poison of
the Amanita, and to eat the residue. Acetic acid or vinegar does _not_
destroy the poison; it dissolves it to an extent and extracts it, and
becomes as poisonous as the plant itself. There is no means of telling
how much of the poison remains in the plant after such treatment. The
safe plan is to eat, only, of toadstools which do not contain any poison
to extract.

One redeeming virtue, alone, rests with A. muscaria—it kills flies.


=A. Frost´iana= Pk.—in honor of Charles C. Frost. POISONOUS. (Plate VI,
fig. 5, p. 6.) =Pileus= convex or expanded, bright-orange or yellow,
warty, sometimes nearly or quite smooth, striate on the margin. =Gills=
free, white or slightly tinged with yellow. =Stem= white or yellow,
stuffed, bearing a slight, sometimes evanescent ring, bulbous at the
base, the bulb _slightly margined_ by the volva. =Spores= _globose_,
8–10µ in diameter.

=Plant= 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= about 2 lines
thick. June to October.

This appears like a very small form of the Fly Agaric, to which, as var.
minor, it was formerly referred. The only decided characters for
distinguishing it are its small size and globose spores. Our plant
sometimes grows in company with A. muscaria, but it seems to prefer more
dense woods, especially mixed or hemlock woods. It is generally very
regular and beautiful and has the stem quite often of a yellow color,
and the bulb margined above with a collar-like ring. _Peck_, 33d Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina, _McIlvaine_.

A. Frostiana is found well over the land. It is frequent in shady woods
and seems to favor ground under the prevailing tree—oak, chestnut, pine,
hemlock, whichever it may be. From the many hundreds I have seen, I
think it more likely to be mistaken by the novice for A. Cæsarea than A.
muscaria, because of its often yellow gills and stem. It is much smaller
and thinner than either. In the states I have found it, it is darker
than described, being a rich reddish-orange or scarlet. The partial veil
or ring is very evanescent but often found upon the stem as a yellow,
floccose remnant. The stain of the ring is always noticeable. The volva
is seldom found entire. It, too, is evanescent, but, like the veil, is
found yellow and fluffy, adhering to the fingers when touched.

It is probable that its highly colored cap has caused it to be gathered
by the careless collector of bright-capped Russulæ, and that thus R.
emetica got its bad name. Examine carefully any toadstool resembling it.
The Russulæ have neither ring nor volva.


=A. excel´sa= Fr.—_excelsus_, tall. POISONOUS. =Pileus= 4–5 in. broad,
_brownish-gray_, darker in the center, _fleshy_, soft, globose, then
plane, _pellicle thin_, but viscous, and in reality separable in wet
weather, then the surface is often _wrinkled-papillose_, or in a
peculiar manner hollowed and pitted, sprinkled with angular, unequal,
whitish-gray, easily separating warts, the remains of the friable volva;
margin at first even, but when properly developed manifestly striate,
even furrowed. =Flesh= soft, white throughout, unchangeable. =Stem= 4–6
in. long, 1 in. thick, at first stuffed, almost solid, but at length
hollow, globose-depressed at the base, attenuated upward from the bulb,
covered, sometimes as far as the ring, sometimes only on the lower part
with _dense, squarrose, concentric scales_ (from the epidermis of the
stem being torn), striate at the apex. =Ring= superior, large,
separating-free or at length torn. =Gills= quite _free, rounded_ (not
decurrent on the stem in the form of lines), very ventricose, ½ in. and
more broad, shining white.

The _bulb when young_ is _somewhat marginate_, but by no means
separable, the margin proper, like that of A. muscaria, is marked with
scales, buried in the soil, somewhat rooting, beneath the margin marked
here and there with a concentric furrow. The shorter gills intermixed
are more numerous than is usual among Amanitæ. There is a smaller
variety, with the margin more frequently striate and the stem stuffed,
then hollow. _Fries._

Solitary, in woods, chiefly under beech. _Stevenson._

=A. pantheri´na= De C.—spotted like a panther. Doubtful. =Pileus=
commonly olivaceous-umber when young, fleshy, convex then flattened or
somewhat depressed, with a _sticky pellicle_, which is at first thick
and olivaceous dingy-brown, then thinned out, almost disappearing and
livid, the disk only becoming brownish; _margin evidently striate_; the
fragments of the volva divided into small, equal, white, regularly
arranged, moderately persistent warts. =Flesh= _wholly white_, never
yellow beneath the pellicle. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, ½ in. thick, at first
stuffed then hollow with spider-web fibrils within, equal or attenuated
upward, slightly firm and sometimes scaly downward, _greaved_ at the
base by the separable _volva which has an entire and obtuse margin_.
=Ring= more or less distant, adhering obliquely, white, rarely superior.
=Gills= free, reaching the stem, broader in front, 3–4 lines broad,
shining white.

It is readily distinguished from A. muscaria, var. umbrina, by the white
flesh never becoming yellow beneath the pellicle. Variable in size and
color, which, however, is never red or yellow, and in the position of
the ring.

In woods and pastures. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 7–8×4–5µ _K._; 6–10µ _B._; 8×4µ _W.G.S._; 7.6×4.8µ _Morgan_.

=A. Ravenel´ii= B. and C.—in honor of Henry W. Ravenel. =Pileus= 4 in.
across, convex, broken up into distinct areas, each of which is raised
into an acute, rigid, pyramidal wart. =Stem= 3 in. high, bulbous.
=Volva= thick, warty, somewhat lobed. =Ring= deflexed.

Properties not stated.


=A. russuloi´des= Pk.—resembling a Russula. =Pileus= at first ovate,
then expanded or convex, rough with a few superficial warts, or entirely
smooth, viscid when moist, widely striate-tuberculate on the margin,
pale-yellow or straw color. =Gills= close, free, narrowed toward the
stem, white. =Stem= firm, smooth, stuffed, annulate, equal or slightly
tapering upward, bulbous; annulus thin, soon vanishing. =Volva= fragile,
subappressed. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 10×8µ.

=Plant= 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 1.5–2 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 lines thick.
Grassy ground in open woods. Greenbush. June.

This species is remarkable for the thin striate-tuberculate margin of
the pileus, which causes it to resemble some species of Russula. _Peck_,

                 3. AMANITA STROBILIFORMIS,         19


=A. strobilifor´mis= Vitt.—_strobilis_, a pine-cone, from the shape of
the warts. (Plate VIII, fig. 3, p. 18.) =Cap= 3–10 in. across, convex or
nearly plane, white or cinereous, sometimes yellow on the disk, rough
with angular, mostly persistent warts which sometimes fall away and
leave the pileus nearly smooth; generally whitish, sometimes tinged with
brown; the margin even and extending a little beyond the lamellæ.
=Gills= free, rounded behind. =Veil= large and portions sometimes adhere
to margin of cap. =Stem= 3–8 in. long, up to 1¼ in. thick, equal or
slightly tapering upward, solid, floccose-scaly, white, bulbous, the
bulb very large, sometimes weighing a pound, margined above and
furnished with one or two concentric furrows, somewhat pointed below,
firmly and deeply imbedded in the earth, floccose-mealy when young.

=Spores= elliptical, 13–15×8–10µ _Peck_.

Open woods and borders. June to October.

Edible. _W.G. Smith_, _Curtis_, _Peck_.

This is among the best of species. Its size, solidity, flavor are
marked. I have found specimens weighing a pound and a half. It grows
singly, but when one is found several are apt to be neighbors. When
young, the cap is but a small knob upon a beet or top-shaped base, which
is largely under ground. It cuts like a soft turnip, and has a strong,
pungent, unmistakable odor, like chloride of lime, which entirely
disappears in cooking. As the plant develops the bulb decreases in size.
On all the many specimens the author has seen and eaten, the scabs are
light brown and reddish-brown.


=A. solita´ria= Bull.—growing alone. =Pileus= convex or plane, warty,
white or whitish, even on the margin. =Gills= reaching the stem, white
or slightly tinged with cream color. =Stem= at first mealy or scaly,
equal, solid, white, bulbous, the bulb scaly or mealy, narrowed below
into a root-like prolongation. =Ring= lacerated, often adhering in
fragments to the margin of the pileus and gills. =Spores=
elliptical-oblong, 8–13×6.5µ.

=Plant= 4–8 in. high. =Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 4–6 lines thick.
_Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Solitary in woods and open places. July to October.

Georgia, _H.N. Starnes_; Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; West Virginia, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

Edible. _Curtis_, _H.N. Starnes_, Philadelphia Myc. Club.

In many localities I find it quite plentiful, and it is so reported from
Georgia. Southern and middle New Jersey woods abound with it, and at Mt.
Gretna, Pa., it is always present in its growing months.

The cap is sometimes tinged with brown as are the angular, erect warts
which are generally numerous, but often falling off or few and
scattered. The flesh is white and smells like chloride of lime, but not
nearly so strong as A. strobiliformis. The volva is broken up into
floccose scales which cling to bulb and lower part of stem. These scales
may be white and mealy or brownish. The entire fungus has a fluffy
exterior, which is easily removed by rubbing. The annulus is torn, a
part often adhering to the margin of the pileus and the gills. This and
the long, tapering, rooting bulb are marked characteristics. The bulb is
brittle. It is difficult to get the fungus from the ground entire.

Stem and cap are juicy, tender, mild in flavor, wholesome. It is not
equal in flavor to A. rubescens, but is more delicate.

By many its properties have been stated as poisonous, doubtful.
Quantities of it have been eaten by myself and friends. Hypodermic
injection of its juices into the blood circulation of live animals prove
it perfectly harmless.


=A. can´dida Pk.=—shining white. =Pileus= thin, broadly convex or nearly
plane, verrucose with numerous small, erect, angular or pyramidal,
easily separable warts, often becoming smooth with age, white, even on
the margin. =Flesh= white. =Gills= rather narrow, close, reaching to the
stem, white. =Stem= solid, bulbous, floccose-squamose, white, the
annulus attached to the top of the stem, becoming pendent and often
disappearing with age, floccose-squamose on the lower surface, striate
on the upper, the bulb rather large, ovate, squamose, not margined,
tapering above into the stem and rounded or merely abruptly pointed
below. =Spores= elliptical, 10–13×8µ.

=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 2.5–5 in. long, 5–8 lines thick, the bulb
1–1.5 in. thick in the dried specimens.

This is a fine large species related to A. solitaria, but differing from
it in the character of its bulb and of its annulus. The bulb is not
marginate nor imbricately squamose. Its scales are small and numerous.
Nor is it clearly radicating, though sometimes it has a slight abrupt
point or myceloid-agglomerated mass of soil at its base. The veil or
annulus is large and well developed, but it is apt to fall away and
disappear with age. Its attachment at the very top of the stem brings it
closely in contact with the lamellæ of the young plant and the
striations of its upper surface appear to be due to the pressure of the
edges of these upon it. It separates readily from the margin of the
pileus and is not lacerated. In the mature plant the warts have
generally disappeared from the pileus and sometimes its margin is curved
upward _Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.

Woods. Auburn, N.Y., Alabama, _U. and E._; Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
New Jersey, August to October, _McIlvaine_.

A dozen or more specimens were found in oak woods near Philadelphia, and
carefully tested. Their edible qualities were found to be precisely the
same as A. solitaria.


                    *** _Whole volva friable, etc._


=A. rubes´cens= Pers.—_rubesco_, to become red. (Plate VIII, fig. 2, p.
18. Plate XII, fig. 4, p. 32.) =Pileus= about 4 in. broad,
dingy-reddish, becoming pale flesh-color, tan, scarcely pure, fleshy,
convex, then plane, obtuse, moist but _not glutinous_ in rainy weather
and opaque when dry, covered with unequal, soft, mealy, whitish,
easily-separating warts, which are smaller, harder and more closely
adherent in dry weather; margin even and, when old, slightly striate
only in wet weather. =Flesh= commonly soft, white when fresh, _reddening
when broken_. =Stem= 4–5 in. long, as much as 1 in. thick, stuffed,
somewhat solid, though soft within, conico-attenuated from the thickened
base, reddish-_scaled_, becoming red-white, and without a trace of a
distinct volva at the base. =Ring= superior, large, membranaceous, soft,
striate and white within. =Gills= reaching the stem in an attenuated
manner, forming decurrent lines upon it, thin, crowded, soft, as much as
½ in. broad, shining white.

Very changeable, but readily distinguished from all others of the same
group _by the flesh being reddish when broken_; the stem and pileus are
commonly spotted-red when wounded. In dry weather it is firmer, flesh
reddening more slowly, warts minute. Odor scarcely any. There is a
remarkable variety _circinata_, pileus becoming plane, umber-brown,
warts adnate, crowded, roundish. A. circinatus Schum. _Stevenson._

=Spores= spheroid-ellipsoid, 7–8×6µ _K._; 8×6µ _W.G.S._; 7–9×6–8µ _B._;
elliptical, 8–9µ long. _Peck._

Not reported west of the Mississippi river.

Oak woods, borders and open places. July to September. Indiana, _H.I.
Miller_; West Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
_McIlvaine_.

It is quite common, often growing in large patches. Recent authors agree
upon the edibility and deliciousness of this species. The author knows
it to be one of the most plentiful, useful and delicious, after several
years of pleasant experience with it.

In July, 1899, at Mt. Gretna, I found, growing from the ground
gregariously, a singular fungoid growth from 2–5 in. high; cap
hemispherical, 1 in. in diameter, tightly fitting a solid stem of nearly
the diameter of the cap. The whole was watery white, and evidently
affected by a parasite. It was edible. September 1st Professor Peck
wrote to me: “I think I have found the identity of the diseased Agaric,
of which you sent me samples some time ago. I mean the one affected by
_Hypomyces inæqualis_ Pk. The host is Amanita rubescens, at least
sometimes, and probably always.”

The plant is very heavy for its size. The lack of a volva, the dingy
color and reddish stains distinctly separate this from any poisonous
Amanita.


=A. spis´sa= Fr.—compact, dense;—of the warts. =Pileus= umber, sooty or
gray, fleshy, somewhat compact, convexo-plane, obtuse, smooth, even, but
_marked with small, ash-colored, angular, adnate_ warts; margin even,
but often torn into fibers. =Flesh= _firm, white, quite unchangeable_.
=Stem= 2–3 in. long, as much as 1 in. thick, _solid, turnip-shaped at
the base_, somewhat rooting with a globoso-depressed not marginate bulb,
curt, firm, shining white, at length _squamulose with concentric
cracks_. =Ring= superior, large. =Gills= reaching the stem, _slightly
striato-decurrent_, broad, crowded, shining white. _Fries._

=Spores= 14µ _W.G.S._; subglobose, 8–10µ _C.B.P._; 6µ _W.P._; rather
pear-shaped, 9–10×6µ _Massee_.

=Cap= 2–3 in. across. =Stem= 2½-3 in. long, up to ¾ in. thick.

New Jersey, oak woods, August and September. _McIlvaine._

A. spissa has been reported from but few localities. It is rare in the
latitude of Philadelphia. Half a dozen specimens have been found in
neighboring New Jersey.

Taste and smell strong, but when cooked the dish is savory and not
unlike one of A. rubescens.


=A. as´pera= Fr.—_asper_, rough. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across. =Flesh= rather
thick at the disk, whitish, white or reddish with tints of livid or
gray, _reddish or brownish under the cuticle_; convex then plane, margin
thin and even, rough with firmly adnate, minute, closely crowded,
angular warts, reddish-brown or livid-brownish, not pure white,
unchangeable. =Gills= free and rounded behind, not striately decurrent,
ventricose, white. =Stem= stuffed, striate above the ring, short at
first, ovate, then elongating to 2–3 in., attenuated upward from a
wrinkled bulb, squamulose, white without and within. =Ring= superior,
entire.

=Spores= 8×6µ _Massee_; 8×6–7µ _W.G.S._

The flesh of stem and bulb when eaten by insects is reddish, the bulb
when old is a reddish-brown. The large ring and stem become red when
touched. In these particulars it resembles A. rubescens. In smell it is
somewhat strong, not unlike A. strobiliformis, but not nearly so
pungent.

Cooked it is of excellent quality and flavor. I have eaten it since
1885.


=A. abrup´ta= Pk.—abrupt, of the bulb. =Pileus= thin, broadly convex or
nearly plane, covered with small angular or pyramidal, erect, somewhat
evanescent warts, white, slightly striate on the margin. =Flesh= white.
=Gills= moderately close, reaching the stem and sometimes terminating in
slightly decurrent lines upon it, white. =Stem= slender, glabrous,
solid, bulbous, white, the bulb abrupt, subglobose, often coated below
by the white persistent mycelium, the ring membranous, persistent.
=Spores= broadly elliptical or subglobose, 8–10×6–8µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2.5–4 in. long, 3–4 lines thick.

The chief distinguishing mark of this species is the abrupt, nearly
globose, bulbous base of the stem. This is somewhat flattened above and
is sometimes longitudinally split on the sides. The small warts of the
pileus are easily separable, and in mature specimens they have often
wholly or partly disappeared. The remains of the volva are not present
on the bulb in mature dried specimens, which indicates that the species
should be placed in the same group with A. rubescens, A. spissa, etc.
The latter species have the bulb of the stem similar to that of our
plant, but the color of the pileus and other characters easily separate
it. _Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.

Alabama, _Underwood_; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_. July to
September.

This species is edible and quite equal in quality to A. rubescens. Great
care should be exercised in distinguishing it.


=A. nit´ida= Fr.—_niteo_, to shine. =Pileus= when flattened 4 in. broad,
whitish, fleshy, _somewhat compact_, at first hemispherical, wrapped up,
the _thick volva_ forming a floccose crust, then _broken up into thick,
remarkably angular, adhering warts, which become brownish_, dry,
shining, without a glutinous pellicle, margin always even. =Flesh=
_white, quite unchangeable_. =Stem= 3 in. long, 1 in. thick, solid,
_firm_, conico-attenuated, _with a bulb-shaped base, squamulose_, white.
=Ring= superior, thin, torn, slightly striate, white, villous beneath,
at length disappearing. =Gills= _free_, crowded, _very broad_, as much
as ½ in., ventricose, shining white. _Fries._

Menands. Albany county. Our plant is more slender than the typical form,
and has smaller but more numerous warts, but in other respects it
exhibits the characters of this species. _Peck_, 43d Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

California, _H. and M._; Maryland. Common in nearly every woods in
Maryland. _Banning._

From its likeness to poisonous species it should be suspected.


=A. prairiic´ola= Pk—_prairie, colo_, to inhabit. =Pileus= thin, convex,
slightly verrucose, white, more or less tinged with yellow, even on the
margin. =Flesh= white. =Gills= rather broad, subdistant, reaching the
stem, white. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward, somewhat squamose
toward the base, white or whitish, the annulus persistent. =Spores=
large, broadly elliptical, 12–14µ long, 7–9µ broad.

=Pileus= 1.5–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–2.5 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Bare ground on open prairies. Kansas. September. _E. Bartholomew._

This species belongs to the same tribe as A. abrupta. The only evidence
of the presence of a volva shown by the dried specimens is found in a
few inconspicuous, but separable warts on the pileus. There is no well
marked bulb to the stem and no evidence remains of a volva at its base.
_Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.

Reported from Kansas only. Qualities unknown.


=A. monticulo´sa= Berk.—mountain, from the warts. =Pileus= 2.5–3 in.
across, convex, areolate, with a wart in the center of each areola;
those toward the margin consisting of soft threads meeting in a point,
but sometimes simply flocculent, the central warts angular, pyramidal,
truncate, discolored. =Stem= bulbous, scaly, flocculent, white. =Veil=
thick, at length distant. =Gills= free, ventricose, remote, forming a
well-defined area around the top of the stem. The warts are not hard and
rigid as in A. nitida, and the free remote gills separate it from that
and the neighboring species. _Berk._

North Carolina, sandy woods, common. _Curtis._

Properties not known.


=A. dau´cipes= B. and M.—_daucum_, a carrot; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= 2–5
in. broad, hemispherical, globose. =Flesh= white, soft, warts regular,
pyramidal, saffron color. =Gills= narrow, reaching the stem, broadest in
the middle. =Stem= 5–6 in. high, solid, base bulbous, with a restricted
cortina above, squamulose downward. =Veil= fibrillose, extending from
the margin of the pileus to the apex of the stem, fugacious.

In cultivated fields. Ohio. _Sullivant._ Properties not given.


=A. lenticular´is= Lasch.—resembling (the stem) a lentil.

Fries places this species in Amanita, in which Stevenson follows him.
Cooke and Massee place it in Lepiota, where it will be found.


             **** _Volva rudimentary, wholly disappearing._


=A. chlorinos´ma= Pk.—smelling like chlorine. (Plate VIII, fig. 1, p.
18.) =Pileus= convex or expanded, warty on the disk, covered on the even
margin with a light powdery, at length evanescent substance, white.
=Gills= white. =Stem= nearly cylindrical, stout, deeply penetrating the
earth. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 7–10µ long. Odor distinct,
chlorine-like.

=Plant= 6–7 in. high. =Pileus= 4–6 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. thick.
_Peck_, Bot. Gaz., Vol. 4.

Burnt ground in woods. August. Closter, N.J., _C.F. Austin_; Alabama,
_U. and E._; West Virginia, _Nuttall_; New Jersey, _Ellis_; Mt. Gretna,
Pa., July, in a cluster of a dozen individuals, and afterward until
frost, strong smelling, warts brownish-white. _McIlvaine._

It is edible and equal to A. strobiliformis.


=A. calyptra´ta= Pk. =Pileus= fleshy, thick, convex or nearly plane,
centrally covered by a large irregular persistent grayish-white fragment
of the volva, glabrous elsewhere, striate on the margin, greenish-yellow
or yellowish-brown tinged with green, the margin often a little paler or
more yellow than the rest. =Lamellæ= close, nearly free, but reaching
the stem and forming slight decurrent lines or striations on it,
yellowish-white tinged with green. =Stem= stout, rather long, equal or
slightly tapering upward, surrounded at the base by the remains of the
ruptured volva, white or yellowish white with a faint greenish tint.
=Spores= broadly elliptic, 10µ long, 6µ broad, usually containing a
single large nucleus.

=Pileus= 10–20 cm. broad. =Stem= 10–15 cm. long, 12–20 mm. thick.

Rich ground in fir woods or their borders. Autumn. Oregon. _Dr. H.
Lane._

This is a large and interesting species, well marked and easily
recognized by its large size, by the greenish tint that pervades the
pileus, lamellæ, annulus and stem, and especially by the large
persistent patch of grayish-white felty material that covers the center
of the pileus and sometimes extends nearly to the margin. This is in
fact the upper part of the ruptured volva that is carried up by the
growing plant, and is very suggestive of the specific name. In the young
state the plant is entirely enveloped in the volva, which then is
similar to a goose egg in size and shape, and its walls are one-fourth
to one-half inch thick. So thick and firm are they that the young plant
appears sometimes to be unable to break through and it decays in its
infancy.

Dr. Lane says that, having found that the Italians made use of this
mushroom for food, he began eating it and introducing it to his friends,
and he learned by personal trial that it is a thoroughly good and
wholesome mushroom, which, when broiled with bacon, fried, baked or
stewed, may be eaten with perfect safety and that it is a nutritious
food. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 27, January, 1900.


=A. crenula´ta= Pk. =Pileus= thin, broadly ovate, becoming convex or
nearly plane and somewhat striate on the margin, adorned with a few thin
whitish floccose warts or with whitish flocculent patches, whitish or
grayish, sometimes tinged with yellow. =Lamellæ= close, reaching the
stem, and sometimes forming decurrent lines upon it, floccose crenulate
on the edge, the short ones truncate at the inner extremity, white.
=Stem= equal, bulbous, floccose mealy above, stuffed or hollow, white,
the annulus slight, evanescent. =Spores= broadly elliptic or subglobose,
7.5–10µ long, nearly as broad, usually containing a single large
nucleus.

=Pileus= 2.5–5 cm. broad. =Stem= 2.5–5 cm. long, 6–8 mm. thick.

Low ground, under trees. Eastern Massachusetts. September. _Mrs. E.
Blackford_ and _George E. Morris_.

The volva in this species must be very slight, as its remains quickly
disappear from the bulb of the stem. The remains carried up by the
pileus form slight warts or thin whitish areolate patches. The annulus
is present in very young plants, but is often wanting in mature ones, in
which state the plant might be mistaken for a species of Amanitopsis.
Its true affinity is with the tribe to which A. rubescens belongs. As in
that species, the bulb soon becomes naked and exhibits no remains of the
volva. It is similar to A. farinosa also in this respect, but quite
unlike it in color, in the adornments of the pileus and in the character
of its margin, which is even in the young plant and but slightly striate
in the mature state. Its dimensions are said sometimes to exceed those
here given, and it is reported to have been eaten without harm and to be
of an excellent flavor. I have had no opportunity to try. _Peck_, Bull.
Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 27, January, 1900.




                          =AMANITOP´SIS= Roze.

                    _Amanita_; _opsis_, resembling.

Having a universal veil at first completely enveloping the young plant,
which soon bursts through, carrying particles of it on the pileus, where
they appear as scattered warts readily brushed off; the remainder or
volva closely enwraps the base of the stem. Ring absent. Spores white.
This genus was formerly included in Amanita. It differs from Amanita in
the absence of a ring or collar upon the stem and in the more sheathing
volva. It differs from Lepiota in having a volva.

Close observation is necessary in collecting Amanitopsis for the table.
_It has no trace of ring or veil upon the stem._ So far as the species
are known no poisonous one exists. But Amanita spreta Pk., which is
deadly, so closely resembles forms of Amanitopsis that those confident
of their knowledge will be deceived. The veil or traces of veil, which
Amanita spreta always has, sometimes so adheres to and wraps the stem
that it is not noticeable without close examination, thus giving to it
every appearance of an Amanitopsis.

The volva of A. spreta is attached for a considerable distance to the
base of the tapering stem, and is not readily removed. This is a guide
to detect it. It is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

Amanitopsis corresponds to Volvaria in the pink-spored series, in which,
as far as known, there is no poisonous species.

All American species of Amanitopsis are given. Several have not been
tested by the writer because of lack of opportunity.

=A. vagina´ta= Roze—_vagina_, a sheath. (Plate X, figs. 1, 2, p: 28.)
=Pileus= thin, fragile, glossy, smooth except in rare instances where a
few fragments of the volva adhere to it for a time, deeply and
distinctly striate on the margin, sometimes umbonate. =Flesh= white, in
the dark forms grayish under the skin. =Stem= ringless, sometimes
smooth, but generally mealy or floccose, hollow or stuffed with a
cottony pith, _not bulbous_. =Volva= long, thin, fragile, closely
sheathing yet free from the stem, except in the lower part, easily
detachable and frequently remaining in the ground when the plant is
pulled. =Color= variable, generally mouse-gray, sometimes livid,
tawny-yellow or white, in one variety a rich date-brown. =Spores=
globose, 8–10µ broad _Peck_; elliptical 10×7–8µ _Massee_.

Var. _liv´ida_ Pers.—livid. Leaden brown, gills dingy. (Plate X, fig. 2,
p. 28.)

Var. _ful´va_ Schæff.—yellowish. Tawny-yellow or pale ochraceous.

This plant is widely dispersed, having been reported from many
localities in the United States, also from Nova Scotia and Greenland.

On ground in woods and on margins of woods, under trees, in shaded
grassy places. Sometimes in open stubble and pastures. June to frost.
Mt. Gretna, September, 1899, found a cluster on decayed chestnut stump.
Various colors abound—hazel, brown, gray, yellow, whitish. The caps and
stems are tender as asparagus tips, but without much distinct flavor
when cooked.

Great care must be taken to distinguish these forms from Amanita spreta
Pk. which is poisonous. See heading of genus—Amanitopsis.


=A. niva´lis= Grev.—snowy. (Plate X, fig. 3, p. 28.) =Pileus= at first
ovate, then convex or plane, smooth, _striate on the thin margin,
white_, sometimes tinged with yellow or ochraceous on the disk. =Flesh=
white. =Gills= subdistant, white, free. =Stem= equal, rather tall,
nearly smooth, _bulbous_, stuffed, white; the volva very fragile, _soon
breaking up into fragments or sometimes persisting in the form of a
collar-like ring at the upper part of the bulb_. =Spores= globose,
7.5–10µ in diameter.

=Plant= 4–6 in. high. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 lines thick.
July to October.

It approaches in some respects A. Frostiana, but its larger size, smooth
pileus, lighter color and the absence of an annulus will easily
distinguish it from that species. _Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Specimens have been repeatedly found by the writer in open oak woods
near Philadelphia.

A strong, unpleasant bitter, which appears to develop while cooking,
renders it unpalatable. It is harmless, but its use is not advised.


=A. velo´sa= Pk.—_velosus_, fleecy. =Pileus= at first subglobose, then
bell-shaped or nearly plane, generally bearing patches of the remains of
the whitish felty or tomentose volva, elsewhere glabrous, becoming
sulcate-striate on the margin, buff or orange-buff. =Flesh= compact,
white. =Gills= close, reaching the stem, subventricose, pale cream
color. =Stem= firm, at first attenuated and tomentose at the top, then
nearly equal, stuffed, white or whitish, closely sheathed at the base by
the thick volva. =Spores= globose, 10–13µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 3–4 lines thick.

Under oak trees. Pasadena, California. April. _A.J. McClatchie._

This fungus is closely related to A. vaginata, from which it may be
separated by the more adherent remains of the thicker volva which
sometimes cover the whole surface of the pileus, and by the thicker
gills which are somewhat adnate to the stem and terminate with a
decurrent tooth. Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 22, No. 12.

As it is probable this species will be found elsewhere than California,
and from its close relation to A. vaginata likely to be edible, its
description is here given.


=A. strangula´ta= (Fr.) Roze—choked, from the stuffed stem. (Plate X,
fig. 4, p. 28.) =Pileus= at first ovate or subelliptical, then
bell-shaped, convex or _plane, warty_, slightly viscid when moist,
_deeply and distinctly striate on the margin_, grayish-brown. =Gills=
free, close, white. =Stem= equal or tapering upward, stuffed or hollow,
nearly smooth, white or whitish, _the volva soon breaking up into scales
or subannular fragments_. =Spores= globose, 10–13µ.

=Plant= 4–6 in. high. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–6 lines thick.
_Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

_A. Ceciliæ_ B. and Br. is a synonym.

Not distinct in color and general appearance from A. vaginata, but
distinctly separated by its warty pileus and evanescent mouse-colored
volva which does not sheath the stem. =Pileus= striate when young, then
sulcate. =Stem= mealy, especially on the upper part.

Woods, open grassy places, wheat stubble, etc. June to September.
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, _McIlvaine_.

In the latitude of Philadelphia the plant is found in great abundance.
Its rather early appearance, staying quality, delicate consistency and
flavor make it valuable as a food supply.

Pearl color, bluish-gray and gray are the prevailing cap-coloring.


=A. adna´ta= (W.G.S.) Roze—_adnatus_, adnate, of the gills. =Pileus=
about 3 in. across. =Flesh= thick, whitish, firm, convex, then expanded,
rather moist, pale yellowish-buff, often furnished with irregular,
woolly patches of volva; margin even, extending beyond the gills. =Stem=
2–4 in. long, ½ in. thick, cylindrical, rough, fibrillose, pale buff,
flesh distinct from that of the pileus, stuffed, then hollow; base
slightly swollen. =Volva= adnate, white, downy, margin free and lax,
sometimes almost obsolete. =Gills= truly adnate, crowded, with many
intermediate shorter ones, white. =Spores= subglobose, with an oblique
point, 7–8µ _Massee_.

Tender, good flavor, yielding more substance when cooked than any other
Amanitopsis.


=A. volva´ta= Pk.—possessing a volva. =Pileus= convex, then nearly
plane, slightly striate on the margin, hairy or floccose-scaly, white or
whitish, the disk sometimes brownish. =Gills= close, free, white. =Stem=
equal or slightly tapering upward, stuffed, minutely floccose-scaly,
whitish, inserted at the base in a large, firm, cup-shaped, persistent
volva. =Spores= elliptical, 10×8µ.

=Plant= 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 2–3 broad. =Stem= 3–4 lines thick.
_Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

The plant is easily recognized by its large, cup-shaped volva and cap,
which is not smooth, as is usual in a species with a persistent
membranous volva, more or less scaly with minute tufts of fibrils or
tomentose hairs. The gills are white in the fresh plant.

Professor Peck notes the species as quite rare. Numerous specimens occur
in the sandy oak woods of New Jersey, and in oak woods near Angora,
Philadelphia. July to October.

Care must be taken to determine the absence of an annulus or any trace
of one. Tender, delicate, without pronounced flavor. Equal to
Amanitopsis vaginata.


=A. farino´sa= Schw.—covered with _farina_, meal. =Pileus= nearly plane,
thin, _flocculent-pulverulent, widely and deeply striate on the margin_,
grayish-brown or livid-brown. =Gills= free, whitish. =Stem= whitish or
pallid, equal, stuffed or hollow, mealy, _sub-bulbous_, the volva
_flocculent-pulverulent_, evanescent. =Spores= variable, _elliptical
ovate or subglobose_, 6–8µ long.

=Plant= about 2 in. high. =Pileus= 1 in. to 15 lines broad. =Stem= 1–3
lines thick. July to September.

This is our smallest Amanita (now Amanitopsis). It is neither very
common nor very abundant when it does occur. It is described by
Schweinitz as “solid,” but I have always found it stuffed or hollow.
_Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=A. pusil´la= Pk.—small. =Pileus= thin, broadly convex or nearly plane,
subglabrous, slightly umbonate, even on the margin, pale brown. =Gills=
narrow, thin, close, free, becoming brownish. =Stem= short, hollow,
bulbous, the bulb margined by the remains of the membranous volva.
=Spores= broadly elliptical, 5–6×4µ.

[Illustration: SECTION OF LEPIOTA PROCERA.]


=Pileus= _generally scaly_ from the breaking up of the cuticle and the
adherence of the concrete veil. =Gills= free, often very distant from
the stem and attached to a _cartilaginous_ collar. =Stem= hollow or
stuffed, its flesh distinct from that of the pileus. =Ring= at first
attached to the cuticle of the pileus, often movable, sometimes
evanescent.

On the ground. Several are found in hot-houses and hot-beds, and are
probably introduced species.

The universal veil, covering the entire plant when very young, is
closely applied to the pileus, which from the breaking up of the cuticle
is generally scaly. The =stem= in most species differs in substance from
the pileus. This is readily seen by splitting the plant in half from cap
to base. It is easily separated from the cap, leaving a cup-like
depression therein. =Gills= usually white. In some species they are
yellow-tinted. In others they become a dingy red when wounded or ageing.

The veil in this genus, being concrete with the cuticle of the pileus,
never appears as loose warts or patches, neither is there a volva as in
Amanita and Amanitopsis. These three genera are the only ones in the
white-spored series having gills free from the stem. In a few species
the gills are slightly attached to the stem, but are never decurrent
upon it as in Armillaria. When the plant is young it is egg-shaped. It
then gradually spreads, becomes convex, and opens until it is nearly
flat, with a knob in the center.

The only species in this genus known to be poisonous to some persons is
L. Morgani Pk., which is distinguished by its green spores and white
gills becoming green. L. Vittadini has also been regarded with
suspicion.

=Ring= movable. The plant is at first entirely enclosed in a universal
veil, which splits around at the base, the lower part disappearing on
the bulb, the upper part attached to the pileus breaking up into scales.
=Stem= encircled at the top with a cartilaginous collar to which the
free, remote gills are attached.

                CLYPEOLARII (_L. clypeolaria_). Page 39.

Ring fixed, attached to the upper portion of the universal veil which
_sheaths the stem_ from the base upward, making it downy or scaly below
the ring. The remainder of the veil united with the pileus breaking up
and becoming downy or scaly. Collar at the apex of stem not so large as
in Proceri, hence the gills are not usually so remote. Taste and smell
unpleasant, resembling that of radishes.

                      PROCE´RI. Ring movable, etc.


=L. proce´ra= Scop.—_procerus_, tall. (Plate XIII, p. 34.) Tall Lepiota,
Parasol Mushroom, in some localities Pasture Mushroom (a misleading
title).

The =Flesh= not very thick, soft, permanently white. =Pileus= at first
ovate, finally expanded, cuticle soon breaking up into brown scales,
excepting upon the umbo, umbo smooth, dark-brown, distinct. The caps
vary in shades of brown, sometimes they have a faint tinge of lavender.
=Gills= whitish, crowded, narrowing toward the stem, and very remote
from it. =Stem= variable in length, often very long, tubular, at first
stuffed with light fibrils, quite bulbous at base, generally spotted or
scaly with peculiar snake-like markings below the ring, which is thick,
firm and readily movable. When the stem is removed from pileus it leaves
a deep cavity extending nearly to the cuticle.

=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 5–12 in. high, about ½ in. thick.

White spores elliptical, 14–18×9–11µ _Peck_; 12–15×8–9µ _Massee_; 14×10µ
_Lloyd_.

Readily known by its extremely tall stem, shaggy cap, distinct umbo and
the channel between the gills and stem. Resembles no poisonous species.

Before cooking the scurf should be rubbed from the caps, which alone
should be eaten, as the stem is tough. Though the flesh is thin, the
gills are meaty and have a pleasant, nutty flavor. Fried in butter it
has few equals. It makes a superior catsup.


=L. racho´des= Vitt. _Gr._—a ragged, tattered garment. =Pileus= very
fleshy, but very soft when full grown, globose then flattened or
depressed, not umbonate, at first incrusted with a _thick, rigid_, even,
very smooth, bay-brown, wholly continuous _cuticle_, which remains
entire at the disk but otherwise _soon becomes elegantly reticulated
with cracks_; these very _readily separate_ into _persistent_,
polygonal, concentric _scales_, which are revolute at the margin and
attached to the surface with beautifully radiating fibers, the surface
remaining coarsely fibrillose-downy. =Flesh= white, _immediately
becoming saffron-red_ when broken, easily separating from the apex of
the distinct stem, which is encircled with a prominent collar. =Stem=
stout, at the first bulbous with a distinct margin upon the bulb,
conical when young, then elongated, attenuated upward, as much as a span
long, very robust, 1 in. thick, and more at the base, always even, and
_without a trace of scales_ or even of fibrils although the appearance
is obsoletely silky, wholly whitish, hollow within, stuffed with
spider-web threads, the walls remarkably and coarsely fibrous. =Ring=
movable, adhering longer to the margin of the pileus than to the apex of
the stem, hence rayed with fibers at the circumference, clothed beneath
with one or two zones of scales. =Gills= _very remote_, tapering toward
each end or broadest at the middle, crowded, whitish, sometimes
reddening. _Stevenson._

Veil remarkable in its development and thick margin.

=Spores= 6×8µ _W.G.S._

Fort Edward, _Howe_; Westfield, N.Y., _Miss L.M. Patchen_; Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

A heavier species than L. procera, of which by some writers it has been
considered a variety, but it differs in the absence of umbo and flesh
becoming tinged with red.

Stem is decidedly swollen downward. Veil heavy, apparently double,
thickest at margin of cap to which it remains attached in heavy
fragments. It tears from the stem, leaving no mark of ring.

Var. _puella´ris_ Fr.—_puella_, a girl. Smaller than typical form,
shining white, pileus with downy scales. Not yet reported in America.

Edible qualities similar to those of L. procera. It is sold
indiscriminately with it in London markets.


=L. excoria´ta= Schaeff.—stripped of its skin. =Flesh= spongy, rather
thick, white, unchangeable. =Pileus= at first globose, then flat, hardly
umbonate, pale-fawn or whitish, disk dark; cuticle thin, silky or scaly,
sometimes areolate, more or less peeled toward margin, hence its name.
=Gills= ventricose, white, free, somewhat remote. =Stem= attenuated,
hollow or stuffed, short, scarcely bulbous, smooth, white, not spotted,
very distinct from flesh of pileus. =Ring= movable but not so freely as
that of L. procera.

=Stem= 1½-2½ high, less than ½ in. thick. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad.

=Spores= 14–15×8–9µ _Massee_.

In pastures or grassy lawns. May to September.

North Carolina, edible, _Curtis_; Massachusetts, _Frost_; California,
_H. and M._; Ohio, _Morgan_; Minnesota, _Johnson_.

Distinguished from the preceding by its smaller size and short stem
which is scarcely bulbous.

Esculent qualities good.


=L. mastoi´dea= Fr. _Gr._—breast-shaped. =Pileus= rather thin, ovate,
bell-shaped, then flattened, with a conspicuous acute umbo, cuticle
thin, brownish, breaking up in minute scattered scales; the pileus
appears whitish beneath. =Stem= hollow, smooth, tough, flexible,
attenuated from the bulbous base to the apex. =Ring= entire, movable.
=Gills= very remote, crowded, broad, tapering at both ends, white.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3–4 lines thick at base,
1½-2 lines at apex.

North Carolina, edible, _Curtis_. It is generally eaten in Europe. In
woods, especially about old stumps. October.

The entire plant is whitish and is well marked by the prominent umbo,
which generally has a depression around it. It has the least substance
of any in this section, and consequently not much value as food.


=L. gracilen´ta= Krombh.—_gracilis_, slender. =Pileus= rather fleshy,
thickest at the disk, ovate then bell-shaped, finally flattened,
obscurely umbonate; at first brownish from the adnate cuticle, which,
breaking up into broad adpressed scales, allows the whitish pileus to be
seen beneath them. =Gills= remote, very broad, crowded, pallid. =Stem=
whitish, obscurely scaly, hollow or containing slight fibrils, slightly
bulbous. =Ring= thin, floccose, vanishing.

=Stem= 5–6 in. long, 3–5 lines thick. In pastures, also in woods.

=Spores= 11×8µ _W.G.S._

Almost as tall as L. procera, but slighter in stem and pileus; the ring,
instead of being firm and persistent, is thin and fugacious, and the
stem is hardly bulbous.

Edible, but not of the first quality.

=L. Mor´gani= Pk.—in honor of Professor Morgan. (Plate XIV.) =Pileus=
fleshy, soft, at first subglobose, then expanded or even depressed,
white, the brownish or yellowish cuticle breaking up into scales except
on the disk. =Gills= close, lanceolate, remote, white, then green.
=Stem= firm, equal or tapering upward, subbulbous, smooth,

_Peck_ in Bot. Gaz., March, 1879.

Open dry grassy places. Dayton, Ohio. _A.P. Morgan._

This species is remarkable because of the peculiar color of the spores.
No green-spored Agaric, so far as I am aware, has before been
discovered, and no one of the five series, in which the very numerous
species of the genus have been arranged, is characterized in such a way
as to receive this species.

It seems a little hasty to found a series (Viridispori) on the strength
of a single species. Until other species of such a supposed series shall
be discovered it seems best to regard this as an aberrant member of the
white-spored series. The same course has been taken with those Agarics
which have sordid or yellowish or lilac-tinted spores.

It gives me great pleasure to dedicate this fine species to its
discoverer Mr. Morgan. _Peck._

Commonly 6–8 in. high, 5–9 in. diameter, though larger specimens are
sometimes found. It is the most conspicuous Agaric in the meadows and
pastures of the Miami valley; it appears to flourish from spring to
autumn whenever there is abundance of rain.

It is heavier and stouter than L. procera and I am disposed to claim
that it is the largest Agaric in the world. =Spores= 10–12×7–8µ. In
immature specimens they are greenish-yellow. _Morgan._

_C.F. Wheeler_ (_Lloyd_, Myc. Notes); Texas, _Prof. W.S. Carter_;
Indiana, _H.I. Miller_.

L. Morgani is one of the largest, handsomest of the genus. It is very
abundant in the western and southwestern states. Mr. H.I. Miller, Terre
Haute, Ind., writes August 18, 1898: “I have recently measured several
which were more than twelve inches across. At the present time this
mushroom is growing in more abundance throughout Indiana than any other.
It grows luxuriantly in the pastures, generally in grand fairy rings,
five, ten, fifteen feet in diameter. We find it also in the woods. It is
beautifully white and majestic, and these rings can be seen in meadows
where the grass has been eaten close, for half a mile or more. The gills
are white until the cap is almost opened, by which time the green spores
begin to cause the gills to change to green. The meat is fine and is
usually more free from worms than other mushrooms. Six families, here,
have eaten heartily of them. The experience is that one or two members
of each family are made sick, though in two families, who have several
times eaten them, no one was made sick. I enjoy them immensely, and
never feel any the worse for eating them. I doubt if we have a
finer-flavored fungus. The meat is simply delicious. One fairy ring
yields a bushel.”

Prof. W.S. Carter, University of Texas, Galveston, reported to me (and
sent specimens of L. Morganii) the poisoning of three laboring men from
eating this fungus. They were seriously sick, but recovered.

The conclusion is inevitable that this green-spored Lepiota contains a
poison which violently attacks some persons, yet is harmless upon
others.

I have not had opportunity to test it. It should be tested with great
caution.


   CLYPEOLA´RII. _Clypeus_, a shield. Ring fixed; stem sheathed, etc.


=L. Frie´sii= Lasch.—in honor of Fries. =Pileus= fleshy, soft, lacerated
into appressed tomentose scales. =Stem= hollow, with a webby pith,
subbulbous, scaly. =Ring= superior, pendulous, equal. =Gills= subremote,
linear, crowded, branched. _Fries._

=Pileus= fleshy but rather thin, convex or nearly plane, clothed with a
soft, tawny or brownish-tawny down, which breaks up into appressed,
often subconfluent scales, the disk rough with small acute, erect
scales. =Flesh= soft, white. =Gills= narrow, crowded, free, white, some
of them forked. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward, subbulbous,
hollow, colored like the pileus below the ring, and there clothed with
tomentose fibrils which sometimes form floccose or tomentose scales,
white and powdered above. =Ring= well developed, flabby, white above,
tawny and floccose-scaly below. =Spores= 7–8×3–4µ.

=Plant= 2–5 in. high. =Pileus= 1–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–5 lines thick.

Catskill mountains and East Worcester. July to September.

I have quoted the description of this species as it is found in
Epicrisis, because the American plant which I have referred to it does
not in all respects agree with this description, but comes so near it
that it can scarcely be specifically distinct. In the American plant, so
far as I have seen it, erect, acute scales are always present,
especially on the disk, and the down of the pileus does not always break
up into distinct areas or scales. Neither is the stem usually scaly, but
rather clothed with soft tomentose or almost silky fibrils. The gills
are crowded and some of them are forked. At the furcations there are
slight depressions which interrupt the general level of the edges, and
give them the appearance of having been eaten by insects. The plant has
a slight odor, especially when cut or bruised. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

Remarks under L. acutesquamosa apply to L. Friesii, which Fries himself
doubts being distinct from the first. The plants vary greatly in size,
color and habitat. The name—acutesquamosa—carries a descriptive meaning
with it that L. Friesii does not.

It does not appear to have been reported except by Professor Peck, but
probably appears as L. acutesquamosa in other lists.

The edible qualities are excellent.


=L. acutesquamo´sa= Wein.—_acutus_, sharp; _squama_, a scale. =Pileus=
fleshy, obtuse, at first hairy-floccose, then bristly with erect, acute,
rough scales. =Stem= somewhat stuffed, stout, bulbous, powdered above
the moderate-sized ring. =Gills= approximate, lanceolate, simple.
_Fries._

=Pileus= convex or nearly plane, obtuse or broadly subumbonate, clothed
with a soft tawny or brownish-tawny tomentum, which usually breaks up
into imperfect areas or squamæ, rough with erect, acute scales, which
are generally larger and more numerous on the disk. =Gills= close, free,
white or yellowish. =Stem= equal, hollow or stuffed with webby
filaments, subbulbous. =Spores= about 7×3–4µ.

Woods and conservatories. Buffalo, _G.W. Clinton_; Albany, _A.F.
Chatfield_; Adirondack mountains and Brewertown, _Peck_.

The form found in the hot-houses seems to have the tomentum of the
pileus less dense and the erect scales more numerous than in the form
growing in woods. The annulus is frequently lacerated. In the specimens
of the woods the erect scales are sometimes blackish in color, and they
then contrast quite conspicuously with the tawny or brownish-tawny
tomentum beneath them. They vary in size and shape. Some resemble
pointed papillæ, others, being more elongated, are almost spine-like.
These are sometimes curved. They are generally larger and more numerous
on the disk than elsewhere, and often they are wholly wanting on the
margin. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Philadelphia, 1897, on lawn and growing from trunk of a maple tree;
Mt. Gretna, Pa., mixed woods. _McIlvaine._

I first saw specimens of L. acutesquamosa when sent to me by Miss Lydia
M. Patchen, President Westfield Toadstool Club. It was later found by
myself and tested. Specimens were sent to Professor Peck and identified
as L. acutesquamosa.

Caps and stems brownish-purple. The pointed squamules or tufts have
dark-brown points, shaded to a delicate purple at base. Gills light,
faint flesh-color. Veil is silky, transparent, beautiful, quite
tenacious—stretching until cap is well expanded, persistent, though at
times fugacious. Smell like stewed mushrooms. The caps are of excellent
substance and flavor.


=L. his´pida= Lasch.—rough. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across. =Flesh= thin,
white, unchangeable; hemispherical then expanded, umbonate, tomentose or
downy at first from the remains of the universal veil; during expansion
the down becomes broken up into small, spreading, scaly points, which
eventually disappear, umber-brown, sometimes with a tawny tinge. =Gills=
free but near to the stem, the collar of the pileus prominent and
sheathing the stem, crowded, ventricose, simple, white. =Stem= about 3–5
in. long, 3–5 lines thick, attenuated upward, densely squamosely-woolly
up to the superior, membranaceous, reflexed ring, dingy-brown, stem
tubular, but fibrillosely stuffed. =Spores= 6–7×4µ _Massee_.

In margins of and in open mixed woods, under pine trees, Haddonfield,
N.J., July to September, 1892. Quite plentiful year after year in the
same places. The American plant is taller than the English species, the
stem reaching five inches, and the color of the cap a delicate
tawny-brown. Smell slight, but pungent like radishes.

The whole fungus is tender and delicious. It is one of the few Lepiotæ
that stews well.


=L. feli´na= Pers.—belonging to a cat. =Pileus= thin, bell-shaped or
convex, subumbonate, adorned with numerous subtomentose or floccose
blackish-brown scales. =Gills= close, free, white. =Stem= slender,
rather long, equal or slightly tapering upward, hollow, clothed with
soft, loose, floccose filaments, brown. =Ring= slight, evanescent.
=Spores= elliptical, 6–8×4–5µ.

=Plant= 2–3.5 in. high. =Pileus= .5–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 lines
thick.

Woods. Adirondack Mountains. August and September.

It is easily distinguished from A. rubrotincta by the darker color of
the scales of the pileus, by the loose floccose filaments that clothe
the brown stem, by the fugacious ring and the smaller spores. _Peck_,
35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

The caps compare favorably with other Lepiotæ in substance and flavor.


=L. crista´ta= A. and S.—_crista_, a tuft, crest. =Pileus= thin,
bell-shaped or convex, then nearly plane, obtuse, at first with an even
reddish or reddish-brown surface, then white adorned with reddish or
reddish-brown scales formed by the breaking up of the cuticle, the
central part or disk colored like the scales. =Gills= close, free,
white. =Stem= slender, hollow, equal, smooth or silky-fibrillose below
the ring, whitish. =Ring= small, white. =Spores= oblong or narrowly
subelliptical, 5–7×3–4µ.

=Plant= 1–2 in. high. =Pileus= .5–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 lines thick.

Grassy places and borders of woods. June to September.

This species is easily known by its small size and the crested
appearance of the white pileus, an appearance produced by the orbicular
unruptured portion of the cuticle that remains like a colored spot on
the disk. The fragments or scales are more close near this central part
and more distant from each other toward the margin, where they are often
wholly wanting. The scales are sometimes very small and almost granular.
In very wet weather the margin of the pileus in this and some other
species becomes upturned or reflexed. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found in Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia. June to September, 1897.
_McIlvaine._

Scales were appressed and slightly tinged with brown, often very small.
Caps of same, upturned and bare near margin. Taste sweet, slightly like
new meal. Odor strong.

Cooked it is of good consistency and pleasing to taste.


=L. alluvi´na= Pk.—_alluvies_, the over-flowing of a river. =Pileus=
thin, convex or plane, reflexed on the margin, white, adorned with
minute pale-yellow hairy or fibrillose scales. =Gills= thin, close,
free, white or yellowish. =Stem= slender, fibrillose, whitish or pallid,
slightly thickened at the base. =Ring= slight, subpersistent, often near
the middle of the stem. =Spores= elliptical, 6–7×4–5µ.

=Plant= 1–2 in. high. =Pileus= .5–1 in. broad. =Stem= 1–1.5 lines thick.
Alluvial soil, among weeds. Albany. July.

In the fresh plant the scales are of a pale yellow or lemon color, but
in drying they and the whole pileus take a deeper rich yellow hue. The
ring is generally remote from the pileus, sometimes even below the
middle of the stem. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

In 1897, I found it growing among weeds on lot near University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Seemingly it is a city resident.

The taste and smell are pleasant. Cooked it is tender and savory. Both
stems and caps are good.


=L. metulæ´spora= B. and Br.—_metula_, an obelisk. =Pileus= thin,
bell-shaped or convex, subumbonate, at first with a uniform pallid or
brownish surface, which soon breaks up into small brownish scales, the
margin more or less striate, often appendiculate with fragments of the
veil. =Gills= close, free, white. =Stem= slender, equal or slightly
tapering upward, hollow, adorned with soft floccose scales or filaments,
pallid. =Ring= slight, evanescent. =Spores= long, subfusiform.

=Plant= 2–3.5 in. high. =Pileus= .5–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 lines
thick.

Woods. Adirondack mountains. August and September.

This species occurs with us in the same localities as L. felina, which
it very much resembles in size, shape and general characters, differing
only in color, the striate margin of the pileus and the character of the
spores.

The species has a wide range, having been found in Ceylon, England,
Alabama and Kentucky. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

This has not been elsewhere noted in the United States, probably from
neglect of the spore characters, being reported as L. clypeolaria.

New Jersey and Pennsylvania. _McIlvaine._


            ANNULO´SI. Ring large, fixed; stem not sheathed.


=L. holoseri´cea= Fr. _Gr._—entire, silken. =Pileus= 3 in. and more
broad, whitish or clay-white, _fleshy_, soft, _convex then expanded_,
rather plane, obtuse, _floccoso-silky_, somewhat fibrillose, _becoming
even_, fragile, disk by no means gibbous; and wholly of the same color;
margin involute when young. =Flesh= soft, white. =Stem= 2½-4 in. long, ½
in. and more thick, _solid_, bulbous and not rooted at the base, soft,
fragile, silky-fibrillose, whitish. =Ring= superior, membranaceous,
large, soft, pendulous, the margin again ascending. =Gills= wholly free,
broad, ventricose, crowded, becoming pale-white. _Fries._

A species well marked from all others. Inodorous.

On soil in flower beds.

=Spores= elliptical, 7–8×5µ _Massee_; 6×9µ _W.G.S._

Wisconsin, _Bundy_; Minnesota, _Johnson_.

Considered esculent in Europe.


=L. Vittadi´ni= Fr.—in honor of the Italian mycologist. =Pileus= 3–4 in.
across. =Flesh= 4–6 lines thick at the disk, becoming very thin at the
margin, white; convex then plane, obtuse or gibbous, densely covered
with small, erect, wart-like scales, altogether whitish. =Gills= free
but rather close to the stem, 3–4 lines broad, rounded in front,
thickish, ventricose, with a greenish tinge. =Stem= 2½-3½ in. long, up
to ⅔ in. thick, cylindrical, with numerous concentric rings of squarrose
scales, up to the superior, large ring; whitish, or the edges of the
scales often tipped with red, solid. _Fries._

In pastures, etc.

Intermediate between Lepiota and Amanita.

Noted by Fries as poisonous. It may or may not be, but as a matter of
precaution it is described. A large species, pure white, extremely
beautiful.

Massachusetts, _Farlow_.

=L. nauci´na= Fr. No translation applicable. =Pileus= 1–1½ in. broad,
white, the disk of the same color, fleshy, soft, gibbous or obtusely
umbonate when flattened, even, _the thin cuticle splitting up into
granules_. =Stem= 1½-3 in. long, stuffed, at length _somewhat hollow_,
but without a definite tube, _attenuated upward_ from the thickened

_L. naucina_ Fr. is the European species which has its American
counterpart in L. naucinoides Pk. The variations in the American species
are noted under L. naucinoides.

As Amanita phalloides—in its white form—the poisonous white Amanita,
resembles L. naucina or L. naucinoides in some stages of its growth and
may be confounded with it, careful note should be taken of their
external differences. In L. naucinoides the bulb and stem are
continuous, each passing into the other imperceptibly; in A. phalloides
the junction of stem and bulb is abrupt and remains so, and the bulb is
more or less enwrapped in the volva. The ring is also larger than in L.
naucinoides and is pendulous, and the gills are permanently white. A
certain means of distinguishing between them is by the application of
heat as in cooking. On toasting both it will be found that the gills of
the Amanita _remain white_, but those of the Lepiota _turn quickly
brown_.


=L. naucinoi´des= Pk. No translation applicable. (Plates Plate XV, XII
fig. 2, p. 32.) =Pileus= soft, smooth, white or snowy-white. =Gills=
free, white, slowly changing with age to a dirty pinkish-brown or
smoky-brown color. =Stem= ringed, slightly thickened at the base,
colored like the pileus. =Spores= subelliptical, uninucleate, white,
8–10 long×5–8µ broad. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

_Macbride_; New York, _Peck_, 23d, 29th, 35th Rep.; Indiana, _H.I.
Miller_, _Dr. J.R. Weist_.

L. naucinoides Pk. is the American counterpart of L. naucina Fr., a
European species, excepting that the spores of the latter are described
as globose. The caps are ovate when young and usually from 1½-3 in.
across when expanded, but occasionally reach 4 in., smooth, but
frequently rough or minutely cracked in the center, white or varying
shades of white deepening in color at the summit. In a rare form var.
squamo´sa, large, thick scales occur which are caused by the breaking up
of the cap surface. When young the gills are white or faintly yellow,
becoming pinkish or dull brown in age. The pinkish hue is not always
apparent. The outer edge of the veil or ring is thickest; usually it is
firmly attached to the stem, but movable rings are frequently noticed.
When the plant ages the ring is often missing, but traces of it are
always discernible. Stem rarely equal, often it is distinctly bulbous,
generally tapering upward from a more or less enlarged base, hollow when
fully grown, until then containing cottony fibers within the cavity or
appearing solid, 2–3 in. long, ¼-½ in. thick.

Its habitat is similar to that of the common mushroom—lawns, pastures,
grassy places—though unlike the latter it is found in woods. Until
thoroughly acquainted with it, specimens found in woods and supposed to
be L. naucinoides should not be eaten. An Amanita might be mistaken for
it. It is readily distinguishable from the common mushroom and its
allies by the color of the gills and spores which are white, and
differences in stem and veil.

It is found from July until after hard frosts. It was first reported
edible by Professor Peck in 1875, under the name of Agaricus naucinus.

The L. naucinoides is rewarding the favor with which it has been
received as an esculent, it being equal to the common mushroom and quite
free from insects. Large crops of it are reported from all over the
country, and from many sections it is told of as a stranger. During
1897–98 the author has found it in plenty upon ground familiar to him
for years, upon which it had not previously shown itself. The common
mushroom must look to its laurels.

Its cultivation as a marketable crop is possible and probable.


=L. cepæsti´pes= Sow.—_cepa_, an onion; _stipes_, stem. (Plate XII, fig.
3, p. 32.) =Pileus= thin, at first ovate, then bell-shaped or expanded,
umbonate, soon adorned with numerous _minute brownish scales_, which are
often _granular or mealy, folded into lines_ on the margin, white or
yellow, the umbo darker. =Gills= thin, close, free, white, becoming
dingy with age or in drying. =Stem= rather long, tapering toward the
apex, generally _enlarged in the middle or near the base_, hollow.
=Ring= thin, subpersistent. =Spores= subelliptical, with a single
nucleus, 8–10×5–8µ.

=Plant= often cespitose, 2–4 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem=
2–3 lines thick.

Rich ground and decomposing vegetable matter. Also in graperies and
conservatories. Buffalo, _G.W. Clinton_; Albany, _A.F. Chatfield_.

=Spores= elliptical, 7–8×4µ _Massee_; 8×4µ _W.G.S._; 8–10×5–8µ _Peck_.

Haddonfield, N.J., Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_; New York, _Mrs. E. C.
Anthony_; Indiana, _H.I. Miller_. July to October.

Whoever has seen the seed-stalks of an onion knows the shape from which
this fungus takes its name. The dense clusters are graceful, dainty, and
contain many individuals of all ages—from the very young with egg-shaped
heads, like pigmy C. comatus, to the fluff-capped eldest, willowy and
fair to look upon. The out-door kind soon droops when matured; the young
plants of a cluster will remain fresh for several days after taken from
their habitat. Stems in these tufts are often quill-shaped, and the
striations on the cap margins are shorter than those on their indoor
cousins. These grow in hot-houses and stables. One of the two forms has
a yellow cap, the other is white and fair.

These forms have often come to my table as a pleasant winter surprise.
Children in the hot-houses of Haddonfield, N.J., watched for its
appearance among the bedded plants, sure of a present when they brought
me a meal of it. Both the white and yellow varieties were equally
enjoyed.

The entire fungus is tender and delicious cooked in any way.


=L. farino´sa= Pk.—_farina_, meal. =Pileus= thin, rather tough,
flexible, at first globose or ovate, then bell-shaped or convex, covered
with a soft, dense, white veil of mealy down, which soon ruptures,
forming irregular, easily-detersible scales, more persistent and
sometimes brownish on the disk. =Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Gills=
close, free, white, minutely downy on the edge. =Stem= equal or slightly
tapering upward, somewhat thickened at the base, slightly mealy, often
becoming glabrous, hollow or with a cottony pith above, solid at the
base, white, pallid or straw-colored, the ring lacerated, somewhat
appendiculate on the margin of the pileus, evanescent. =Spores=
subovate, 10–13×8µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–2.5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Mushroom beds in a conservatory, Boston, Mass. March. Communicated by
_E.J. Forster_.

This species is related to L. cepæstipes, from which it may be
distinguished by its pileus, which is not folded on the margin, and by
its larger spores. It is edible. It is very distinct from Amanita
farinosa. _Peck_, 43d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Ohio, _Lloyd_, _Prof. William Miller_ (Lloyd Myc. Notes).


=L. America´na= Pk. (Plate XII, fig. 1, p. 32. Plate XV_a_.) =Pileus= at
first ovate, then convex or expanded, umbonate, scaly, white, the umbo
and scales reddish or reddish-brown. =Gills= close, free, white. =Stem=
somewhat thickened at or a little above the base, hollow, bearing a
ring, white. =Spores= subelliptical, uninucleate, 8–10×5–8µ.

The American lepiota belongs to the same genus as the parasol mushroom
and the Smooth lepiota. It has one character in which it differs from
all other species of Lepiota. The whole plant when fresh is white,
except the umbo and the scales of the cap, but in drying it assumes a
dull reddish or smoky-red color. By this character it is easily
recognized.

In the very young plant the cap is somewhat egg-shaped and nearly
covered by the thin reddish-brown cuticle, but as the plant enlarges the
cuticle separates and forms the scales that adorn the cap. On the
central prominence or umbo, however, it usually remains entire. The
margin of the cap is thin and is generally marked with short radiating
lines or striations. The gills do not quite reach the stem and are,
therefore, free from it. Sometimes they are connected with each other at
or near their inner extremity by transverse branches. They are a little
broader near the margin of the cap than at their inner extremity. The
stem affords a peculiar feature. It is often enlarged towards the base
and then abruptly narrowed below the enlargement, as in the
Onion-stemmed lepiota. In some instances, however, the enlargement is
not contracted below and then the stem gradually tapers from the base
upward. The stem is hollow and usually furnished with a collar, but
sometimes this is thin and may disappear with advancing age. Wounds or
bruises are apt to assume brownish-red hues.

The caps vary in width from 1–4 in.; the stems are from 3–5 in. long,
and 2–5 lines thick. Sometimes plants attain even larger dimensions than
these. The plants grow singly or in tufts in grassy ground or on old
stumps. They may be found from July to October.

In flavor this species is not much inferior to the parasol mushroom, but
when cooked in milk or cream it imparts its own reddish color to the
material in which it is cooked. It is, however, a fine addition to our
list of esculent species. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

I found several on a decaying willow trunk, and on the ground beside it,
in Philadelphia. In July, 1898, large quantities, often clustered, grew
under the great, open auditorium of the Pennsylvania Chautauqua, at Mt.
Gretna, Pa., from ground covered with crushed limestone.

The caps are meaty and excellent in flavor. They should be broiled or
fried.


        GRANULOSI. Pileus granular or warty. Stem sheathed, etc.


=L. granulo´sa= Batsch.—_granosus_, full of grains. =Pileus= thin,
convex or nearly plane, sometimes almost umbonate, rough, with numerous
granular or branny scales, often radiately wrinkled, rusty-yellow or
reddish-yellow, often growing paler with age. =Flesh= white or
reddish-tinged. =Gills= close, rounded behind and usually slightly
adnexed, white. =Stem= equal or slightly thickened at the base, stuffed
or hollow, white above the ring, colored and adorned like the pileus
below it. =Ring= slight, evanescent. =Spores= elliptical 4–5×3–4µ.

=Plant= 1–2.5 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 lines
thick. Woods, copses and waste places. Common. August to October.

This is a small species with a short stem and granular reddish-yellow
pileus, and gills slightly attached to the stem, a character by which it
differs from all the preceding. The ring is very small and fugacious,
being little more than the abrupt termination to the coating of the
stem. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 5–6×3µ _B._; 3×4µ _W.G.S._; elliptical, 4–5×3–4µ _Peck_.

Var. _rufes´cens_ B. and Br. Pure white at first, then partially turning
red and in drying acquiring everywhere a reddish tint.

Var. _al´bida_ Pk. Persistently white.

Though small many plants grow neighboring. Being fleshy for their size,
and of pleasing quality, they well repay gathering. Remove stems.

Open woods, Angora, West Philadelphia; Haddonfield, New Jersey,

             _A._ CUTICLE VISCID. NEITHER SCALY NOR WARTY.


=L. delica´ta= Fr.—_delicatus_, delicate. Up to 1½ in. across, reddish,
becoming yellowish toward margin. Flesh well proportioned to cap,
convex, obscurely umbonate, glabrous, slightly viscid. =Stem= 1½-2 in.
long, very thin, but covered with dense downy scales, equal, lighter
than cap. =Ring= usually entire, membranaceous, fluffy from scales.
=Gills= free, crowded, ventricose, white.

Haddonfield, N.J., January, 1896–97, in hot-houses. _McIlvaine._

A delicate, delicious Lepiota. Though small, it is meaty. Its appearance
in hot-houses (it is found in woods) insures a crop at a time of year
when other species are not plentiful, and when anything edible in the
toadstool line is most welcome to their lovers.


=L. lenticula´ris= Lasch.—_lenticula_, a lentil. =Pileus= at first
globose, then convex, even, naked, pinkish-tan color. =Flesh= thick,
spongy, white. =Gills= close to stem, but free from it, ventricose,
crowded, whitish. =Stem= 4–6 in. high, thick, equal or swollen at base,
solid but spongy, more or less covered with scales; above the ring it is
frequently covered with drops of water more or less green, which leave
spots when they dry. =Veil= superior and very large.

=Pileus= 3–4 in. across. =Stem= 4–6 in. long, ½ in. and more thick. In
damp woods.

Redman’s Woods, Haddonfield, N.J. September, 1894. _McIlvaine._

This species is included in Amanita by Fries and Stevenson. Massee
places it in Lepiota. In the dozen or more specimens I have found, there
was no trace of a volva, even when very young. I tested it carefully and
at one time ate three good-sized caps without experiencing any
indications of poison. I have seen it during but one season and not then
(at one time) in sufficient quantity to make a meal off it. Cooked it
has a slight cheesy flavor which is pleasant.


=L. illi´nita= Fr.—_illino_, to smear over. =Pileus= rather thin, soft,
at first ovate, then campanulate or expanded, subumbonate, smooth,
white, very viscid or glutinous, even or striate on the margin. =Gills=
close, free, white. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward, stuffed or
hollow, viscid, white. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 5×4µ broad.

=Plant= 2–4 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2.5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 lines thick.

Thin or open woods. Adirondack mountains. July to September.

This is a smooth white species with the stem and pileus clothed with a
clear viscid or glutinous veil. The margin of the pileus is often even,
but the typical form of the species has it striate. The flesh is soft
and white. The species may be distinguished from the viscid white
species of Hygrophorus by the free, not adnate nor decurrent lamellæ.
_Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Springton and Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1887–1897. _McIlvaine._

Not yet found by me in quantity. Several specimens eaten were of good
flavor.


=L. rugulo´sa= Pk. =Pileus= thin, submembranaceous, broadly convex or
nearly plane, umbonate, rugulose, widely striate on the margin, whitish.
=Lamellæ= thin, narrow, close, free, whitish. =Stem= short, equal,
slightly silky, whitish, the annulus thin, persistent, white. =Spores=
elliptic, 7.5µ long, 4µ broad.

=Pileus= 12–20 mm. broad. =Stem= about 2.5 cm. long, 2 mm. thick.

Moist grassy places under trees. Washington, D.C. July. _Mrs. E.M.
Williams._ Perhaps in the fresh state the pileus is not as distinctly
rugulose as when dry. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 27, January,
1900.

                           =ARMILLA´RIA= Fr.

                           _Armilla_, a ring.


(Plate XVII.)

[Illustration: ARMILLARIA MELLEA.]

=Pileus= and =Stem= continuous. =Veil= partial, sometimes only indicated
by the scales which clothe the stem terminating in the form of a ring.
=Spores= white. On the ground or on stumps.

In the young plant the veil extends from the stem to the pileus,
sometimes forming scaly patches upon it; below the ring it is attached
to the stem often in scales.

But for the presence of the ring the species of this genus could be
distributed in Tricholoma, Clitocybe and Collybia, with which they agree
in all other characters.

In Amanita and Lepiota, the other ringed genera of the white-spored
series, the flesh of the stem and pileus is not continuous; and their
stems are therefore easily separated. Amanita is also distinguished by
its volva.

=A. robus´ta= A. and S.—_robustus_, robust, sturdy. Substance of entire
plant compact. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across, varying in shades of gray and
brown, scaly, fibrillose on margin, decreasing toward center or smooth,
convex or top-shaped and margin involute at first, expanding. =Flesh=
firm, very thick. =Gills= broad, emarginate, nearly free, crowded,
whitish, up to ½ in. broad. =Veil= large, membranaceous, sometimes
floccose, remaining adherent to the stem. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, obese,
solid, tapering at the base, brownish-white and fibrillose below veil,
white and flocculose above, flesh of stem continuous with that of the
cap.

narrow.

=Spores= ovoid-spherical. 7µ. _Q._

Edible, _Curtis_; District Columbia, _Mrs. M. Fuller_.

In mixed woods. Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

The substance of A. robusta differs from all other Armillaria in being
very compact. It is not acrid but has a marked flavor. Cut into small
pieces and well cooked it makes an acceptable dish. It is best in
croquettes and patties, or served with meats.


=A. viscid´ipes= Pk.—_viscidus_, sticky; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= fleshy,
compact, convex or nearly plane, glabrous, whitish with a slight
yellowish or reddish-yellow tint. =Flesh= white, odor peculiar,
penetrating, sub-alkaline. =Gills= narrow, crowded, sinuate or
subdecurrent, whitish. =Stem= equal, solid, viscid and slightly tinged
with yellow below the narrow membranous ring, whitish above. =Spores=
elliptical, 8×5µ.

=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.

In mixed woods. Rock City, Dutchess county. October.

It is a large fine fungus, easily known by its white and yellowish hues,
its crowded gills, viscid stem and peculiar penetrating almost alkaline
odor. The cuticle of the pileus is thin and soft to the touch, but it
sometimes cracks longitudinally and is sometimes slightly adorned with
innate fibrils. A. dehiscens is said to have a viscid stem, but it is
also squamose and the pileus is yellowish-ochraceous. _Peck_, 44th Rep
N.Y. State Bot.

Quite common in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. _McIlvaine._

It loses its strong odor when cooked and is equal to other Armillaria in
edibility. Unless well cooked it has a slight saponaceous flavor. This
is easily overcome by a few drops of lemon juice or sherry.


=A. appendicula´ta= Pk.—bearing an appendicula or small appendage.
=Pileus= broadly convex, glabrous, whitish, often tinged with rust color
or brownish rust color on the disk. =Flesh= white or whitish. =Gills=
close, rounded behind, whitish. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering
upward, solid, bulbous, whitish, the veil either membranous or webby,
white, commonly adhering in fragments to the margin of the pileus.
=Spores= subelliptical, 8×5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3.5 in. long; 5–10 lines thick.

Auburn, Ala. October. _C.F. Baker._

The general appearance of this species is suggestive of Tricholoma
album, but the presence of a veil separates it from that fungus and
places it in the genus Armillaria. The veil, however, is often slightly
lacerated or webby and adherent to the margin of the pileus. _Peck_,
Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 24.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., Angora, Pa. On decaying roots in ground. August to
November. Found plentifully in resorts of other Armillaria. Edibility
the same. _McIlvaine._


=A. pondero´sa= Pk.—_ponderosus_, weighty, ponderous. =Pileus= thick,
compact, convex or subcampanulate, smooth, white or yellowish, the naked
margin strongly involute beneath the slightly viscid, persistent veil.
=Gills= crowded, narrow, slightly emarginate, white inclining to cream
color. =Stem= stout, subequal, firm, solid, coated by the veil, colored
like the pileus, white and furfuraceous above the ring. =Flesh= white.
=Spores= nearly globose, 4µ in diameter.

=Plant= 4–6 in. high. =Pileus= 4–6 in. broad. =Stem= about 1 in. thick.

Ground in woods. Copake, Columbia county. October.

The veil for a long time conceals the gills, and finally becomes
lacerated and adheres in shreds or fragments to the stem and margin of
the pileus. _Peck_, 26th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

New England, _Frost_; New York, _Peck_, Repts. 26, 29, 41. West Virginia
and Pennsylvania. Ground in woods. September to November. _McIlvaine._

Professor Peck says in 26th Report: “This species has not been found
since its discovery in 1872.”

Where the Armillaria mellea frequents I have often found A. ponderosa.
It was plentiful at Mt. Gretna, Pa., in September, 1898. Young specimens
are quite as edible as A. mellea, and rather more juicy.

                 II.—CLITOCYBÆ. Gills not sinuate, etc.


=A. mel´lea= Vahl.—_melleus_, of the color of honey. (Plate XVI, fig. 1,
p. 52.) =Pileus= adorned with minute tufts of brown or blackish hairs,
sometimes glabrous, even or when old slightly striate on the margin.
=Gills= adnate or slightly decurrent, white or whitish, becoming sordid
with age and sometimes variegated with reddish-brown spots. =Stem=
ringed, at length brownish toward the base. =Spores= elliptical, white,
8–10µ long. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 9×5–6µ _W.G.S._; 10×8µ _B._; 8–10µ _Peck_.

The A. mellea is unusually prolific and is common over the United States
and Europe. Specimens may be found in the spring-time, but in middle
latitudes it is common from August until after light frosts. It is
usually in tufts, some of which contain scores of plants and are showy
over ground filled with roots, or on stumps or boles of decaying trees.
It frequents dense woods and open clearings. I have seen acres of dense
woodland at Mt. Gretna, Pa., so covered with it and its varieties that
but few square yards were unoccupied.

A description of the typical A. mellea will rarely apply to any one
plant. A combination of its variable features in one description would
include something of nearly every white-spored Agaric under the sun. Yet
there is something indescribable about it which once learned will
unerringly betray it.

Its =Caps= vary from perfectly smooth, through tufts of scales and
hairs, more or less dense, to matted woolliness. It may show any one of
these conditions in youth and be bald in age. Some shade of yellow is
the prevailing color, but this will vary from whitish to dark-purplish
or reddish-brown. When water-soaked it is one color, when dry, another.
Commonly the margins of the =Caps= are striated, sometimes they are
smooth as a cymbal, and not unlike one, have a raised place or umbo in
the center. =Flesh= white or whitish. =Gills= when young are white or
creamy, usually running down the stem, sometimes slightly notched at
attachment. They freckle in age and lose their fair complexion. The
=Veil= or collar about the stem is as variable as fashion—thick and
closely woven or flimsy as gossamer, or vanishing as the plant grows
old. The =Stems= may be even as a lead pencil, or swollen like a
pen-holder, or bulbous toward the base, or distorted by pressure in the
tufts. It is as variable in color as the cap, usually darkening downward
in hues of brown. The outside is firm and fibrous, sometimes furrowed,
inside soft or hollow.

=Cap= 1–6 in. across. =Stem= 1–6 in. long, ¼-¾ in. thick.

Var. _obscu´ra_ has the cap covered with numerous small blackish scales.

Var. _fla´va_ has the cap yellow or reddish-yellow, but in other
respects it is like the type.

Var. _gla´bra_ has the cap smooth, otherwise like the type.

Var. _radica´ta_ has a tapering, root-like prolongation of the stem,
which penetrates the earth deeply.

Var. _bulbo´sa_ has a distinctly bulbous base to the stem, and in this
respect is the reverse of var. radicata.

Professor Peck writes: “Var. _exannulata_ (Plate XVI, fig. 2, p. 52) has
the cap smooth and even on the margin, and the stem tapering at the
base. The annulus is very slight and evanescent or wholly wanting. The
cap is usually about an inch broad, or a little more, and the plants
grow in clusters, which sometimes contain forty or fifty individuals. It
is more common farther south than it is in our state (N.Y.), and is
reported to be the most common form in Maryland. This I call var.
exannulata.” From _Dr. Taylor_, Washington, D.C.; Indiana, _H.I.
Miller_.

To these may be added also var. _al´bida_ Pk. in which the pileus is
white or whitish.

A variety, perhaps a variation of var. bulbosa was sent to me by E. B.
Sterling, Trenton, N.J., and afterward found by myself at Mt. Gretna,
Pa. The =Cap= purplish-brown, convex, striate and light on margin, edge
irregular with parts of veil attached. =Flesh= white, very thin. =Gills=
decurrent, arcuate, pinkish-gray. =Stem= stuffed, fibrous, white above,
dense floccose veil, same color as cap below, swollen toward base which
is pointed, sulcate, white inside, closely clustered and some of the
stems distinctly bulbous. =Taste= decidedly unpleasant. An intense
acridity develops and increases when the juices of raw pieces are
swallowed, and the salivary glands are much excited. The acridity is not
lost in cooking. It simply can not be eaten. Specimens were sent by me
to Professor Peck who referred it to A. mellea.

I have never seen the abortive form of Clitopilus abortivus, though
found in many places and in great quantity, showing any part or trace of
the original plant. But that a similar monstrosity occurs upon A. mellea
is shown by individuals and parts of individuals of a cluster being
aborted. Without such positive proof, no one would suspect either of
these odd formations to be abortive of either C. abortivus or A. mellea,
or any other fungus. I consider the abortive form of A. mellea far
superior in substance and flavor to it or any of its varieties.

The Armillaria can not be ranked among the tender or high-flavored
toadstools, yet their abundance, meaty caps and nourishing qualities
place them among our most valuable food species.

The caps when chopped into small pieces make good patties and
croquettes. They have an impressive flavor of their own, and offer an
esculent medium for seasoning and the gravies of various meats.


=A. nardos´mia= Ellis—_nardosmius_, of the odor of nardus. (A name
applied by the ancients to several plants, especially _spica
nardi_—spikenard.) =Pileus= fleshy, firm, thick and compact on the disk,
thin toward the margin, whitish, variegated with brown spots, with a
thick, tough and separable cuticle. =Flesh= white. =Gills= crowded,
subventricose, slightly emarginate, whitish. =Stem= solid, fibrous, not
bulbous, sheathed below by the brown velvety veil, the ring narrow,
spreading, uneven on the edge. =Spores= subglobose, 6µ in diameter.

=Pileus= about 3 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Ground in woods, Suffolk county. September. _Peck_, 43d Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

Several specimens from sandy grounds in pine woods, Haddonfield, N.J.,
were sent by me to Professor Peck and were identified by him. Plentiful
at Mt. Gretna, Pa., September to frost, 1898. In mixed woods, on
gravelly ground. Eaten in quantity by several persons. _McIlvaine._

Cuticle of caps when dry breaking up into brownish, squamulose scales,
margin involute. =Gills= subdecurrent. =Veil= thick, persistent. =Stem=
short, subbulbous, solid. =Flesh= white. Very much resembles a
short-stemmed Lepiota. Smell and taste strong, like almonds. Disappears
in cooking.

       III.—COLLYBIÆ. Gills adnate, stem somewhat cartilaginous.


=A. mu´cida= Schrad.—_mucidus_, slimy. =Pileus= commonly shining white,
thin, almost transparent, hemispherical then expanded, obtuse, more or
less radiato-wrinkled, smeared over with a thick tenacious gluten;
margin striate when thinner. =Stem= 1½-3 in. long, 1–2 lines thick at
the apex, thickened at the base, stuffed, thin, rigid, curved ascending,
smooth, white, but sooty scaly at the base when most perfectly
developed. =Ring= inserted at the apex of the stem, bent downward and
glued close to the stem, furrowed, the white border again erect, with a
swollen and entire margin, which sometimes becomes dingy brown. =Gills=
rounded behind, obtuse, adhering to the stem and striato-decurrent,
distant, broad, lax, mucid, always shining white.

Very variable in stature, from 1 in. (when of this size the stem is
almost equal) to as much as 6 in. broad. The color of the pileus varies
gray, fuliginous, olivaceous. The gills sometimes become yellow, but
only from disease. Sometimes solitary, sometimes a few are joined in a
cespitose manner at the base. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptical, 15–16×8–9µ _Massee_; 17×14µ _W.G.S._

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Pennsylvania, _Schweinitz_;
Maryland, _Miss Banning_.

West Virginia mountains, 1882, Haddonfield, N.J., 1891–94, on beech
trees and roots. _McIlvaine._

Commonly considered esculent in Europe.

Dirt adheres so tenaciously to it that it is difficult to clean. This,
however, occurs only when the fungus grows from roots and pushes its way
up through covering earth. When growing from trees it is attractive and
of good quality.

Should be chopped fine and well cooked.




                           =TRICHOLO´MA= Fr.

                        _Gr._—a hair, a fringe.


                                                            (Plate XIX.)

[Illustration: SECTION OF TRICHOLOMA.]

=Pileus= symmetrical, generally fleshy, never truly umbilicate, seldom
umbonate. =Veil= absent or appearing only as fibrils or down on the
margin of the pileus. =Gills= sinuate (the small sudden curve near the
stem always apparent in the young plant), sometimes with a slightly
decurrent tooth. =Stem= central, usually stout, fleshy-fibrous, without
a bark-like skin. =Flesh= continuous with that of the pileus. =Ring= and
=Volva= absent. =Spores= white or dingy.

But one is known to be poisonous. Some are acrid or unpleasant in
flavor. With one exception all grow on the ground in pastures and woods,
appearing from May to late in the autumn.

Gills generally white or dingy, frequently spotted or stained. The
pileus may be smooth or adorned with fibrous or downy scales, dry,
moist, viscid or water-soaked.

The distinguishing feature of Tricholoma is the sinuate gills. In
Collybia the stem bears a distinct bark-like skin; in Clitocybe the
gills are never sinuate; species of Pleurotus are distinguished by
growing on wood only, and Paxillus by their strongly-incurved margin and
anastomosing gills.

In cooking Tricholoma consistency must be the guide to plan and time.
The tougher varieties require to be cut into small pieces and to be well
cooked, while the brittle and delicate varieties will cook quickly. Many
of them make excellent soups.

                          ANALYSIS OF TRIBES.

moist, viscid, water-soaked, nor distinctly scaly; rather thin, opaque,
absorbing moisture, but is the same color as the gills. Stem fibrous, by
which the smaller species resembling Collybia may be distinguished.

* Gills broad, rather thick, somewhat distant.

Pileus thin, somewhat umbonate; flesh at length soft, watery. Stem
rootless, containing a pith, entirely fibrous.

Flesh not exceeding in depth the width of the not broad, thin gills;
thinnest toward the margin, hence somewhat umbonate. Color of the pileus
either moist or dry, very variable in the same species. Pileus sometimes
pulverulent from the persistence of the veil in dry weather.

* Gills whitish, not spotted.

** Gills more or less violet, gray or smoky. Not represented.

=T. eques´tre= Linn.—_equestre_, belonging to a horseman or knight, from
distinguished appearance. =Pileus= fleshy, compact, convex becoming
expanded, obtuse, pale-yellowish, more or less reddish tinged, the disk
and central scales often darker, the margin naked, often wavy. =Flesh=
white or tinged with yellow. =Gills= rounded behind, close, nearly free,
_sulphur-yellow_. =Stem= stout, solid, pale-yellow or white, white
within. =Spores= 6.5–8×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 6–10 lines thick.

Pine woods, especially in sandy soil. Albany county. September to
November.

This is a noble species but not plentiful in our state (N.Y.). The
pileus is said to become greenish very late in the season. The stem, in
the typical form, is described as sulphur-yellow in color, but with us
it is more often white. The scales of the disk are sometimes wanting. In
our plant the taste is slightly farinaceous at first, but it is soon
unpleasant.

Var. _pinastreti_ A. and S. is a slender form having a thin, even
pileus, thinner and more narrow gills and a more slender stem. A.
crassus Scop., A. aureus Schaeff., and A. flavovirens Pers. are recorded
as synonyms of this species. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Professor Peck later says in “Mushrooms and Their Use,” p. 52: “I
confidently add it to the list of edible species.”

New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In pine forests and groves.
September to frost. _McIlvaine._

I have eaten it since 1883. All disagreeable odor about T. equestre
(which I have seldom noticed) disappears upon cooking. The substance is
rather tough, but good.


=T. coryphæ´um= Fr.—chief, leader. From its distinguished appearance.
=Pileus= very fleshy but not compact, convex then plane, obtuse, viscid,
yellowish, streaked with small brownish scales. =Stem= solid, attenuated
upward. =Gills= emarginate, crowded, white, edge yellow.

Large and of striking appearance. In shady beech woods.

Pronounced a good edible by the Boston Myc. Club.

The color of the plants is given as greenish-yellow. Bull. Boston Myc.
Club, 1896.


=T. ustale= Fr.—_uro_, to burn. =Pileus= fleshy, convex, then plane,
obtuse, even, smooth, viscid, bay-brownish. =Stem= stuffed, equal, dry,
rufo-fibrillose, apex naked, silky, nearly smooth. =Gills= emarginate,
crowded, white, at length with reddish spots. _Cooke._

Chiefly in pine woods.

=Pileus= 3 in. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, about ½ in. thick.

=Spores= 5×8µ _W.G.S._; 7–8×5µ _Massee_.

North Carolina, _Curtis_, pine woods, _Schweinitz_; Kansas, _Cragin_.
Massachusetts. Edible. Boston Myc. Club, Bull. No. 5.


=T. resplen´dens= Fr.—shining brightly. =Pileus= fleshy, convex then
nearly plane, even, bare, _viscid, white_, sometimes hyaline-spotted or
yellowish on the disk, shining when dry, the _margin straight_. =Flesh=
white, taste mild, odor pleasant. =Gills= nearly free when young, then
emarginate, somewhat crowded, rather thick, entire, white. =Stem=
_solid_, bare, subbulbous, even, dry, white. =Spores= 8×4µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 4–8 lines thick.

Thin woods. Catskill mountains. September. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., in mixed woods. October and November. _McIlvaine._

It is of excellent flavor, consistency and food value.


=T. transmu´tans= Pk.—changing. =Pileus= convex, _nearly bare_, viscid
when moist, brownish, reddish-brown or tawny-red, usually paler on the
margin. =Flesh= white, taste and odor farinaceous. =Gills= narrow,
close, sometimes branched, whitish or pale yellowish, becoming dingy or
reddish-spotted when old. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward,
_bare_ or slightly silky-fibrillose, stuffed or hollow, whitish, often
marked with reddish stains or becoming reddish-brown toward the base,
white within. =Spores= subglobose, 5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Woods. The plants are often cespitose.

I suspect that Agaricus frumentaceus of Curtis’s catalogue belongs to
this species. Both the pileus and stem, as well as the gills, are apt to
assume darker hues with age or in drying, and this character suggested
the specific name. The species is classed as edible. _Peck_, 44th Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

Curtis catalogues T. frumentaceum as edible.

T. transmutans is reported from many states. It has a mealy taste and
odor. Wherever it is found it is a valuable food species.


=T. sejunc´tum= Sow.—separated; from the peculiar manner in which the
gills separate from the stem. =Pileus= fleshy, convex then expanded,
umbonate, slightly viscid, _streaked with innate brown or blackish
fibrils_, whitish or yellowish, sometimes greenish-yellow. =Flesh=
white, fragile. =Gills= _broad, subdistant_, rounded behind or
emarginate, white. =Stem= solid, stout, often irregular, white. =Spores=
subglobose, 6.5µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 4–8 lines thick.

Mixed woods. Suffolk county, N.Y. September.

The plants referred to this species are not uncommon on Long Island,
growing on sandy soil in woods of oak and pine. They are usually more or
less irregular and the pileus becomes fragile. It is quite variable in
color, sometimes approaching a smoky-brown hue, again being nearly
white. The taste of the typical form is said to be bitter, but the
flavor of our plant is scarcely bitter. In other respects, however, it
agrees well with the description of the species. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

=Spores= 6µ. _W.G.S._

Flesh is tender. Cooked, of good body and peculiar but pleasant flavor.
A valuable species, baked, scalloped, fried.


=T. terri´ferum= Pk.—_terra_, earth; _fero_, to bear. =Pileus= broadly
convex or nearly plane, irregular, often wavy on the margin, glabrous,
viscid, _pale-yellow_, generally soiled with adhering particles of earth
carried up in its growth. =Flesh= white, with no decided odor. =Gills=
thin, crowded, slightly adnexed, white, not spotted or changeable.
=Stem= equal, short, solid, white, _floccose-squamulose at the apex_.
=Spores= minute, subglobose, 3µ.

=Pileus= 3–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1–1.5 in. long, 6–8 lines thick.

Woods. Catskill mountains. September. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. August to frost.
_McIlvaine._

Not inviting, hard to clean, nevertheless edible and good.


=T. portento´sum= Fr.—_portentosus_, strange, monstrous. =Pileus= 3–5
in. broad, _sooty_, livid, sometimes violaceous, fleshy, but thin in
comparison with the stoutness of the stem, convexo-plane, somewhat
umbonate, unequal and turned up, viscid, _streaked with black lines_
(innate fibrils), but otherwise even and smooth, the very thin margin
naked. =Flesh= not compact, white, fragile. =Stem= commonly 3 in. often
4–6 in. long, 1 in. thick, stout, _solid_, the whole remarkably
fibrous-fleshy, somewhat equal, _naked_, but _fibrilloso-striate_,
white; the base, which is occasionally attenuato-rooted, villous.
=Gills= rounded, almost free, 3–4 lines to as much as 1 in. broad,
_distant, white_, but varying, becoming pale-gray or yellow. _Fries._

=Spores= 4–5×4µ _K._; 5×4µ _W.G.S_

West Virginia, 1882; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, in woods and open places.
May to November. _McIlvaine._

It is one of the first toadstools I experimented upon. I have been
constant to it. Its caps fried in butter are unsurpassed.

       ** _Gills discolored, usually spotted with reddish-brown._


=T. fla´vo-brun´neum= Fr.—_flavus_, yellow; _brunneus_, brown. =Pileus=
fleshy, conical, then convex, at length expanded, subumbonate, viscid,
_clothed with streak-like scales_. =Stem= _hollow, somewhat ventricose_,
fibrillose, _at first viscid, yellowish within_, tip naked. =Gills=
emarginate, _decurrent_, crowded, yellowish, then reddish. _Fries._

Odor that of new meal. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, ½ in. thick, dull-reddish or
brownish. =Pileus= 3–6 in. broad, disk darker, dingy dull-red or
reddish-brown.

North Carolina, _Curtis_; damp woods, A. fulvus, _Schweinitz_.

Edible, _Cooke_, 1891.


=T. rus´sula= Schaeff.—reddish. (Plate XVIII, fig. 3, p. 60.) =Pileus=
fleshy, convex, becoming plane or centrally depressed, obtuse, viscid,
even or dotted with granular squamules on the disk, _red or incarnate_,
the margin usually paler, involute and minutely downy in the young
plant. =Flesh= white, sometimes tinged with red, taste mild. =Gills=
sub-distant, rounded behind or subdecurrent, white, often becoming
red-spotted with age. =Stem= solid, firm, whitish or rose-red,
squamulose at the apex. =Spores= elliptical, 7×4µ.

=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 6–8 lines thick.

Mixed woods. Albany. Cattaraugus and Steuben counties. September and
October.

According to the description the typical plant has the pileus incarnate
and the stem rosy-red, but in the American plant the pileus is generally
more clearly red and the stem white, though this is often varied by
reddish stains. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mixed woods. August until after frost. At Mt. Gretna, Pa. 1897–1898 the
patches were large, generous yielders.

Edible, _Cooke_; edible, _Cordier_, _Roques_.

T. russula is a dressy fungus and has a fashion of its own. The
mottlings upon its cap, gill and stem, in shades of red, subdued though
they be, give it a handsome personality distinct from any other.

The species is a variable one in its minor markings. When moisture is
prevalent the caps of all are viscid. Both young and old are often
cracked. Stems frequently not squamulose at apex, frequently rosy when
young, often flattened. The fibrous interior of the stem and its fibrous
connection with the flesh of the cap are very marked. Gills emarginate
in youth as well as in age. It is solitary, gregarious, occasionally
bunched.

An excellent fungus, a free late grower, meaty, easily cooked, and of
fine flavor.


=T. frumenta´ceum= Bull.—_frumentum_, made of corn. =Pileus= 2–3 in.
broad, whitish or clay-color and variegated dull red, truly fleshy,
convex then plane, obtuse, viscous, dry in fine weather, _even, smooth_.
=Flesh= white. =Stem= 3 in. long, ½ in. thick, _solid, equal,
fibrillose_ when dry, whitish. =Gills= _rounded_, somewhat crowded,
rather broad, white, at length spotted-red.

Wholly _becoming pale white_, but the stem and pileus are alike
_marked-red_, and the gills are at length reddish, wherefore, as well as
for the _strong smell of new meal_, it is undoubtedly nearest to A.
pessundatus. When full grown it has all the appearance of Entoloma. On
the ground. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 6µ _W.G.S._

North Carolina, _Curtis_. Edible. Porcher says Dr. Curtis was the first
to declare it edible.


=T. pessunda´tum= Fr.—_pessum dare_, bent downward. =Pileus= fleshy,
compact, convex, very obtuse, repand, viscid, _granulose or spotted_.
=Stem= solid, firm, at first ovato-bulbous, _everywhere villose with
whitish scales_. =Gills= emarginate, nearly free, crowded, white, at
length spotted with red.

In pine woods. Odor and taste mealy.

=Pileus= bay, reddish, paler at the margin. Stature of Ag. equestris.
_Fries._

=Spores= 5×2.5µ Massee; very minute, globose, 2–3µ _C.B.P._

Reckoned edible, but very rare. _Stevenson._

=T. decoro´sum= Pk.—_decorus_, decorous. =Pileus= firm, at first
hemispherical, then convex or nearly plane, adorned with numerous
_brownish sub-squarrose tomentose scales_, dull ochraceous or tawny.
=Flesh= white. =Gills= close, rounded and slightly emarginate behind,
the edge slightly scalloped. =Stem= solid, equal or slightly tapering
upward, white and smooth at the top, elsewhere _tomentose-scaly_ and
colored like the pileus. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 5×4µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Decaying trunks of trees. Catskill mountains and Alleghany county.
September and October.

A rare but beautiful species. It is often cespitose. It departs from the
character of the genus in growing on decaying wood. _Peck_, 44th Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

Tricholoma decorosum is not rare in Pennsylvania. I have found it at
Angora, Philadelphia and in Chester county, Pa., growing in clusters and
singly. At first sight one might take it for one of the many forms of
Armillaria, but even cursory examination shows the difference.

It is of good consistency and flavor, having a decided mushroom taste.


=T. flaves´cens= Pk.—pale yellow. =Pileus= convex, firm, often
irregular, dry, _slightly silky becoming bare_, sometimes cracking into
minute scales on the disk, _whitish or pale yellow_. =Flesh= whitish or
yellowish. =Gills= close, white or pale-yellow, emarginate, floccose on
the edge. =Stems= firm, solid, often unequal, central or sometimes
eccentric, single or cespitose, colored like the pileus. =Spores=
subglobose, 5µ in diameter.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2.5 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Pine stumps. Albany and Rensselaer counties. October.

The species seems to be related to T. rutilans but has not the red or
purplish tomentum of that fungus. It, like T. decorosum, is always
lignicolous. T. rutilans is sometimes so. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

Frequently found in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Pine
stumps. September to frost. _McIlvaine._

The flesh compares with that of T. rutilans, and makes an equally good
dish.


=T. gran´de= Pk. =Pileus= thick, firm, hemispherical, becoming convex,
often irregular, dry, _scaly_, somewhat silky-fibrillose toward the
margin, _white_, the margin at first involute. =Flesh= grayish-white,
taste _farinaceous_. =Gills= close, rounded behind, adnexed, white.
=Stem= stout, solid, fibrillose, at first tapering upward, then equal or
but slightly thickened at the base, pure white. =Spores= elliptical,
9–11×6µ.

=Pileus= 4–5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 1–1.5 in. thick.

Among fallen leaves in woods. Cattaraugus county. September.

The plants are often cespitose, and then the pileus is more or less
irregular and the gills somewhat lacerated. The species is related to T.
columbetta, from which its larger size, constantly scaly pileus, more
cespitose mode of growth, larger spores and farinaceous taste separate
it. The scales of the pileus are brownish, and the pileus itself is
sometimes slightly dingy on the disk. The young margin is pure white
like the stem, and both it and the upper part of the stem are sometimes
studded with drops of moisture.

The plant was found on trial to be edible, but not of first quality. The
flesh is not very tender, nor the flavor captivating even in young
specimens. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. Mixed woods. August to frost. _McIlvaine._

Gross when old. Young specimens of medium quality and flavor.


=T. columbet´ta= Fr.—_columba_, a pigeon. (Plate XVIII, fig. 5, p. 60.)
=Pileus= convex, then nearly plane, fleshy, obtuse, rigid, somewhat
flexuous, dry, _at first bare, then silky-fibrillose_, becoming even or
scaly, _white_, the margin at first _involute_, more or less tomentose.
=Flesh= white, taste _mild_. =Gills= close, emarginate, thin, white.
=Stem= stout, solid, unequal, nearly bare, white. =Spores= 7–8×4.5µ.

The species is very variable and the following varieties have been
described:

Var. _A_. =Pileus= nearly always repand or lobed, at first bare, even,
at length cracked-scaly, often reddish spotted, the margin when young
inflexed, tomentose. =Stem= obese, even, unequal, swollen, an inch
thick. The typical form.

Birch wood among mosses.

Var. _B_. =Pileus= subflexuous, silky-fibrillose, at length scaly,
sometimes dingy-brown spotted, the margin scarcely tomentose. =Stem=
longer, equal or slightly narrowed at the base.

Bushy places. Intermediate between _A_ and _C_.

Var. _C_. =Pileus= regular, flattened, evidently fibrillose, sometimes
spotted with blue, four inches broad. =Stem= equal, cylindrical,
fibrillose-striate, four inches long.

Beech woods. A showy variety so diverse from variety _A_ that it might
be regarded as a distinct species, did not variety _B_ connect them, and
so much resemble both that it might with equal propriety be referred to
either.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1–4 in. long, 3–12 lines thick.

Woods and pastures. Albany county, N.Y.

It may be distinguished from T. album by its mild taste. It is recorded
as edible. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Edible, _Curtis_, _Cooke_, _Stevenson_.

This much varied Tricholoma is as varied in its habitat. I have found it
on vacant lots in Philadelphia, in mixed woods at Devon, Pa., and in the
forests of the West Virginia mountains, and eaten it since 1881.

It cooks readily and is of mild, agreeable flavor.


=T. ru´tilans= Schaeff.—_rutilo_, to be reddish. =Pileus= fleshy,
campanulate becoming plane, dry, at first _covered with a dark-red or
purplish tomentum_ then somewhat scaly, the margin thin, at first
involute. =Flesh= yellow. =Gills= crowded, rounded, _yellow, thickened
and downy on the edge_. =Stem= somewhat hollow, nearly equal or slightly
thickened or bulbous at the base, soft, pale-yellow variegated with red
or purplish floccose scales. =Spores= 6.5–8×6.5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 5–8 lines thick.

On or about pine stumps, rarely on hemlock trunks. July to November.
_Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= subglobose, 5–6µ diameter _Massee_; 6–8×6µ _B_.; 6×9µ _W.G.S._

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. May to November. _McIlvaine._

Quite common in West Virginia mountains and in pine woods of New Jersey.
The Boston Mycological Club reports it found in quantity in
Massachusetts. The flesh when cooked is gummy, like the marshmallow
confection. It is excellent.

               ** _Gills becoming reddish or gray, etc._


=T. vacci´num= Pers.—_vacca_, a cow. =Pileus= fleshy, convex or
campanulate, becoming nearly plane, umbonate, dry, floccose-scaly,
reddish-brown, the margin _involute, tomentose_. =Flesh= white. =Gills=
adnexed, subdistant, whitish, then reddish or reddish-spotted. =Stem=
equal, _hollow_, covered with a fibrillose bark, naked at the apex, pale
reddish.

=Spores= subglobose, 6µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Under or near coniferous trees. Greene and Essex counties. September and
October. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Recorded as edible by Gillet.

Plentiful in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia. Have eaten it
since 1885. Fair.


=T. fuligi´neum= Pk.—_fuligineus_, resembling soot. =Pileus= convex or
nearly plane, obtuse, often irregular, dry, minutely scaly,
_sooty-brown_. =Flesh= grayish, odor and taste farinaceous. =Gills=
subdistant, uneven on the edge, ash-colored _becoming blackish in
drying_. =Stem= short, _solid_, equal, bare, ash-colored. =Spores=
oblong-elliptical, 8×4µ.

=Pileus= 1–2.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–1.5 in. long, 3–5 lines thick.

Among mosses in open places. Greene county. September. Rare. _Peck_,
44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Quite common in Pennsylvania and New Jersey on mossy wood margins. It is
of fair quality and flavor.

=T. ter´reum= Schaeff.—the earth. (Plate XVIII, fig. 4, p. 60.) =Pileus=
fleshy, thin, soft, convex, campanulate or nearly plane, obtuse or
umbonate, _innately fibrillose or floccose-scaly_, ashy-brown,
grayish-brown or mouse color. =Flesh= white or whitish. =Gills= adnexed,
subdistant, more or less eroded on the edge, _white becoming
ash-colored_. =Stem= equal, varying from solid to stuffed or hollow,
fibrillose, white or whitish. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 6–7×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad.= Stem= 1–2 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Woods. Albany, Rensselaer and Cattaraugus counties. September to
November. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 7×5.5µ _Morgan_; 5–6µ, _Massee_; 6–7×4µ _K._; 6µ _W.G.S._

Eaten by Professor Peck. Eaten by McIlvaine. Quality fair.


=T. ter´reum= Schaeff.—var. _fra´grans_ Pk. =Pileus= convex or nearly
plane, dry, innately-fibrillose or minutely floccose-scaly,
grayish-brown or blackish-brown. =Gills= rather broad, adnexed, whitish
or ash-colored. =Stem= equal, solid or stuffed, rarely hollow, whitish.
=Spores= broadly elliptical, 6–7×4–5µ.

The Fragrant tricholoma has a distinct farinaceous odor and flavor. In
other respects it closely resembles the Earth-colored tricholoma of
which it is considered a mere variety. The typical European plant is
said to be without odor or nearly so and has not been classed among the
edible species by European writers. But our variety, though not
high-flavored, is fairly good and entirely harmless. Its cap varies
considerably in color but is some shade of gray or brown. Its center is
without any prominence or very bluntly prominent, and its surface is
commonly very obscurely marked with innate fibrils or in small plants
may have very small flocculose tufts or scales. The flesh is whitish as
also are the gills, though these sometimes assume a more decided grayish
hue. They are rather broad and loose and sometimes uneven on the edge or
even split transversely. They are usually deeply excavated next the stem
and attached to it by a narrow part. The stem is whitish or slightly
shaded with the color of the cap. It often has a few longitudinal
fibrils, but never any collar. It may be either solid, stuffed or spongy
within, or in large specimens, hollow.

The plants grow gregariously or sometimes in tufts on the ground under
or near trees or in thin woods, especially of pine, or in mixed woods.
The caps vary from 1–4 in. broad, and the stems from 1–3 in. long and
from 2–6 lines thick. The plants occur in autumn. In Europe there is a
variety of this species which also has a farinaceous odor, but it
differs from our plant in having reddish edges to the gills. It is
called variety orirubens. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Var. fragrans is plentiful and gregarious among New Jersey pines,
October to frost. Other varieties are often found. Specimens found by me
at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and sent to Professor Peck who identified them as
var. fragrans Pk., were decidedly umbonate. Gills were easily separable
from cap.

Var. fragrans is a favorite. It is pleasant to many, even raw. Plentiful
salting while cooking develops a high and exquisite flavor.


=T. fumes´cens= Pk.—smoky. =Pileus= convex or expanded, dry, clothed
with a very minute appressed tomentum, whitish. =Gills= narrow, crowded,
rounded behind, whitish or pale cream color, _changing to smoky-blue or
blackish_ where bruised. =Stem= short, cylindrical, whitish. =Spores=
oblong-elliptical, 5–6.5µ.

=Pileus= 1 in. broad. =Stem= 1–1.5 in. high, 2–3 lines thick.

Woods. Columbia county. October. Rare.

The species is remarkable for the smoky or blackish hue assumed by the
gills when bruised and also in drying. It is apparently related to T.
immundum Berk., but in that species the whole plant becomes blackish
when bruised, and the gills are marked with transverse lines and tinged
with pink. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. September to November, 1898. _McIlvaine._

The size of cap sometimes attains to 3 in and stem to ½ in. in
thickness. Taste at first farinaceous then sweetish. The caps are of
excellent quality and flavor.


(Plate XXIII.)

[Illustration:

  TRICHOLOMA IMBRICATUM.
  One-half natural size.
]

=T. imbrica´tum= Fr.—covered with tiles. =Pileus= fleshy, compact,
convex or nearly plane, obtuse, dry, innately scaly, fibrillose toward
the margin, brown or reddish-brown, the margin thin, at first slightly
_inflexed and pubescent then naked_. =Flesh= firm, thick, white. =Gills=
slightly emarginate, almost adnate, rather close, white when young,
becoming reddish or spotted. =Stem= _solid_, firm, nearly equal,
fibrillose, white and mealy or pulverulent at the top, elsewhere colored
like the pileus. =Spores= 6.5 × 4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 4–10 lines thick. Under or
near coniferous trees. Greene and Essex counties. September and October.

This is an edible species. It has a farinaceous odor and taste when
fresh. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Closely resembles T. transmutans in size, color and taste. It is,
however, easily separated by its dry cap and solid stem. _Peck._

Plentiful in pine woods of New Jersey, and among hemlocks in West
Virginia. Mt. Gretna, Pa., under pines. October and November, 1898.
_McIlvaine._

Specimens found at Mt. Gretna had caps dark umber when young, and margin
incurved to stem. Gills yellowish. Stem up to 4 in. long, stout, solid,
swollen at base, and having a short pointed ending, firm, fibrillose,
white. Flavor farinaceous.

Flesh of good texture and taste.

 III.—RIG´IDA. Pileus rigid, cuticle broken up into smooth scales, etc.

    * _Gills white or pallid, not becoming spotted with red or gray.
                           Not represented._

         ** _Gills becoming reddish or grayish, spotted, etc._


=T. sapona´ceum= Fr.—_sapo_, soap. Strong, smelling of an undefinable
soap. =Cap= 2–4 in. across, involute at first, convex then flattened,
dry, glabrous, moist in wet weather, never viscid, brownish, more or
less spotted or having the skin cracked into scales, occasionally
covered with dark fibrils. =Flesh= firm, whitish becoming reddish when
wounded. =Gills= emarginate, with a hooked tooth (uncinate) thin,
distant, pale white. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, about ½ in. thick, often
unequal, base sometimes long and rooting, usually smooth, at times
reticulated with black fibrils, or is scaly. Distasteful.

The species is variable in size and color. Stevenson remarks: “Scarcely
any species has been more confounded with others.” It may always be
safely distinguished by its odor, by its distant gills, by the smooth
cuticle of the cap cracking into scales, and by the change of color to
reddish when bruised.

West Virginia mountains. August to frost. 1881–85. New Jersey,
Pennsylvania. _McIlvaine._

This fungus is not extremely unpleasant when eaten—like T. sulphureum,
but no one will care to eat it. There is nothing in the flavor to
recommend it or to inspire a cultivation of taste for it.

        IV.—SERICEL´LA. Pileus slightly silky, soon smooth, etc.

            * _Gills broad, rather thick, somewhat distant._


=T. sulphu´reum= Bull.—_sulphur_, brimstone. =Odor= strong, fetid or
like gas tar. =Cap= 1–4 in. across, subglobose, then convex and plane,
slightly umbonate, sometimes depressed, fleshy, margin at first
involute. =Color= dingy or reddish sulphur-yellow, at first silky,
becoming smooth or minutely tomentose. =Flesh= thick, yellow. =Gills=
rather thick, narrowed behind, emarginate or acutely adnate, sometimes
appearing arcuate from shape of cap. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 3–5 lines
thick, equal or slightly bulbous, often curved, smooth striate,
sulphur-yellow, stuffed, fibrous or hollow, yellow within, at times
having yellow fibrous roots.

=Spores= 9–10×5µ _Massee_.

Very variable in size. Gregarious, common in mixed woods.

West Virginia, 1881. West Philadelphia, 1886. _McIlvaine._

When quite young T. sulphureum is showy and inviting. Its smell is
discouraging, its taste forbidding. No amount of cooking removes its
unpleasant flavor. I have tried to eat enough of it to test its
qualities, but was satisfied after strenuous efforts to mark it
INEDIBLE.


=T. chrysenteroi´des= Pk.—like gold. =Pileus= fleshy, convex or plane,
not at all umbonate, firm, dry, glabrous or slightly silky, _pale-yellow
or buff_, becoming dingy with age, the margin sometimes reflexed, _flesh
pale-yellow, taste and odor farinaceous_. =Gills= rather close,
emarginate, yellowish, becoming dingy or pallid with age, _marked with
transverse veinlets along the upper edge_, the interspaces veined.
=Stem= equal, firm, _solid_, bare, fibrous-striate, yellowish without
and within. =Spores= elliptical, 8–10×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3–4 lines thick.

Woods. Lewis and Cattaraugus counties. September.

Nearly allied to T. chrysenterum, but separable by the gills, which are
somewhat veiny and not free, by the entire absence of an umbo and by its
farinaceous odor and taste. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Frequently found at Angora, and in Woodland Cemetery, West Philadelphia.

Edible. Fair flavor and good quality.


=T. o´picum= Fr.—uncouth. =Pileus= 1–1½ in. across. =Flesh= rather thin,
becoming grayish; convex, then expanded, obtusely-umbonate, at length
usually upturned and split, very dry, even at first, then minutely
scaly, gray. =Gills= broadly emarginate, ventricose, rather thick,
scarcely distant, hoary. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 2–3 lines thick, equal,
fibrillose, becoming almost glabrous, pallid then grayish, stuffed.
_Massee._

Among moss, in pine woods, etc.

Inodorous. Somewhat resembling T. saponaceum, but distinguished by the
absence of smell.

Waretown, N.J. Under pines and open places in pine woods. August to
September, 1889. _McIlvaine._

When wet the caps become darker and have a mottled appearance. They are
tender, but rather tasteless. The species serves to make quantity when
cooked with others of higher flavor.


=T. pipera´tum= Pk.—_piper_, pepper. =Pileus= rather thin, firm, dry,
convex, obtuse or subumbonate, virgate with innate brownish fibrils,
varying in color from grayish-brown to blackish-brown, sometimes with
greenish or yellowish tints. =Flesh= white or whitish, taste acrid.
=Gills= broad, close, rounded behind, adnexed, whitish or yellowish.
=Stem= generally short, equal, solid, silky, slightly mealy or pruinose
at the top, white or slightly tinged with yellow. =Spores= elliptic,
6–7µ long, 5µ broad. =Pileus= 4–7 cm. broad. =Stem= 5–7 cm. long, 6–12
mm. thick.

The central part of the pileus is sometimes a little darker than the
rest. The peppery or acrid taste is very distinct and remains in the
mouth many minutes. This and the innately fibrillose character of the
pileus are distinguishing characters of the species. The plants appear
from September to November. _Peck_, Torr. Bull., Vol. 26.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. October to November, 1898, on damp ground among moss.
_McIlvaine._

=Cap= up to 3 in. across, bell-shaped, then convex, depressed in center
and undulate, light-brown, darker toward center, dry, minutely
fibrillose. =Flesh= thick, white, thin toward margin. =Gills=
emarginate, unequal, not forked. =Stem= 1½-2 in. long, hard, equal or
enlarging toward base, white, silky, striate.

Though peppery raw, this Tricholoma is of good substance and flavor when
cooked.

      _B._ PILEUS EVEN, SMOOTH, NOT DOWNY, SCALY, NOR VISCID, ETC.

      V.—GUTTA´TA. Pileus marked with drop-like spots or rivulose.

* _Gills whitish._


=T. gambo´sum= Fr.—_gambosus_, swelling near the hoof. =Pileus= 3–4 in.
and more broad, _becoming pale-tan_, fleshy, _hemispherico-convex, then
flattened_, obtuse, undulated and bent backward, even, smooth, but
_spotted as with drops_, at length widely cracked (not, however, torn
into squamules), the _margin at the first involute and tomentose_.
=Flesh= thick, soft, fragile, white. =Stem= 2 in. and more long, ½-1 in.
thick, _solid_, fleshy-firm, almost _equal_, often curved-ascending at
the base, _white_, _downy at the apex_. =Gills= rounded or
emarginato-adnexed, with a somewhat decurrent tooth and when old
sinuato-decurrent, _crowded_, ventricose, 2–3 lines broad, _whitish_.
_Fries._

_Odor_ pleasant, _of new meal_. Often forming large rings or clusters. A
whitish form must not be confounded with T. albellus.

=Spores= 13×11µ _W.G.S._; 13–14×8–9µ _Massee_; 13×10µ _Cooke_.

Angora, Philadelphia. Chester and Lebanon county, Pa. _McIlvaine._ Fair.

               ** _Gills becoming reddish or smoky-gray._


=T. tigri´num= Schaeff.—spotted like a tiger. =Pileus= 2 in. broad,
pallid-brown, variegated with crowded and _darker dingy-brown spots_,
compactly fleshy, convex then expanded, obtuse, repand. =Flesh= thick,
firm, white, unchangeable, but thin at the involute margin. =Stem= 1 in.
long and thick, very compact, solid, pruinate, white. =Gills= rounded
behind, at length decurrent with a tooth, crowded, narrow, white, at
length darker.

Solitary or cespitose. Very distinguished, obese, and without any marked
smell of new meal. In fir woods and open grassy ground. Rare. June to
July. _Stevenson._

Edible, _Cooke_, _Fries_.


=T. albel´lum= Fr.—_albus_, white. =Pileus= about 3 in. broad, becoming
pale-white, passing into gray when dry, fleshy, thick at the disk,
thinner at the sides, _conical then convex_, gibbous when expanded, when
in vigor moist on the surface, _spotted (mottled) as with scales_, the
thin margin naked. =Flesh= soft, floccose, white, unchangeable. =Stem=
curt, 1½-2 in. long, 1 in. thick at the base, reaching ½ in. toward the
apex, _solid_, fleshy-compact, ovato-bulbous (conical to the middle,
cylindrical above the middle), fibrillose-striate, white. =Gills= very
much _attenuated behind, not_ emarginate, _becoming broad in front_,
very crowded, quite entire, white. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, 6–7×4µ _Massee_; ovoid, 3µ _W.G.S._; ovoid, 3µ
_Cooke_.

=Pileus= not becoming yellow. =Odor= weak when fresh, taste pleasant,
almost that of cooked flesh. There are two forms: one larger, solitary,
another smaller, connato-cespitose, quite as in A. albellus Sow. It is
often confounded with smaller forms of A. gambosus. _Stevenson._

North Carolina, _Curtis_. Damp woods. Edible.

       VI.—SPONGIO´SA. Pileus compact then spongy, smooth, moist.

                       * _Gills not discolored._


=T. vires´cens= Pk.—_viresco_, to grow green. =Pileus= convex or nearly
plane, sometimes centrally depressed, moist, bare, _dingy-green_, the
margin sometimes wavy or lobed. =Gills= close, gradually narrowed toward
the outer extremity, rounded or slightly emarginate at the inner, white.
=Stem= subequal, _stuffed or hollow_, thick but brittle, whitish,
sometimes tinged with green. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 5×4µ.

=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.

Thin woods. Essex county. July.

The dull smoky-green hue of the pileus is the distinguishing feature of
this species. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Quite common in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. July to
October. _McIlvaine._

Edible. Tastes somewhat like many Russulæ, when cooked. Flavor good.


=T. fumidel´lum= Pk.—smoky. =Pileus= convex, then expanded, subumbonate,
bare, moist, _dingy-white or clay-color clouded with brown_, the disk or
umbo generally smoky-brown. =Gills= crowded, subventricose, whitish.
=Stem= equal, bare, solid, whitish. =Spores= minute, subglobose, 4.5×4µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–2.5 in. long, 2–3 lines thick.

Woods. Albany county and Catskill mountains. September and October.

The stem splits easily and the pileus becomes paler in drying. It
sometimes becomes cracked in areas. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

On ground. Mt. Gretna. October and November. 1897. _McIlvaine._

The species was plentiful among the leaf mold, growing from the ground
in mixed woods.

The caps are delicate in substance and flavor.


=T. leucoceph´alum= Fr. _Gr._—white; head. =Pileus= 1½-2 in. across,
convex then plane, even, moist, smooth, but when young covered with a
satiny down; water-soaked after rain. =Flesh= thin, tough, white.
=Gills= rounded behind and almost free, white. =Stem= up to 2 in. long,
¼ in. thick, exterior hard, shining, fibrous; interior hollow but solid
at base which is attenuated and rooting, twisted. =Smell= strong of new
meal. Taste pleasant.

=Spores= 9–10×7–8µ.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. Grassy woods and borders. October to November, 1898.
_McIlvaine._

Quite common. The caps are excellent.


=T. al´bum= Schaeff.—_albus_, white. =Pileus= fleshy, tough, convex,

sometimes yellowish on the disk, rarely wholly yellowish, the margin at
first involute. =Flesh= white, taste _acrid or bitter_. =Gills=
emarginate, somewhat crowded, distinct, white. =Stem= solid, elastic,
equal or tapering upward, externally fibrous, obsoletely frosted at the
apex, white. =Spores= elliptical, 5–6µ, long.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Woods. Common. August to October. This species is variable in color and
in size, being sometimes robust, sometimes slender. It grows singly, in
troops or in tufts. It has no decided odor, but a bitter unpleasant
taste. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Cooked, tender and of fair flavor.

                    ** _Gills becoming discolored._


=T. persona´tum= Fr.—wearing a mask (from its many varieties of colors).
(Plate XVIII, p. 60.) =Pileus= compact, becoming soft, thick, convex or
plane, obtuse, regular, moist, bare, variable in color, generally pallid
or ashy tinged with violet or lilac, the margin at first _involute and
frosted with fine hairs_. =Flesh= whitish. =Gills= broad, crowded,
rounded behind, free, _violaceous becoming sordid-whitish or
dingy-brown_. =Stem= generally thick, subbulbous, solid, fibrillose or
frosted with fine hairs, whitish or colored like the pileus. =Spores=
dingy white, subelliptical, 8–9×4–5µ. On white paper the spores have a
slight salmon tint, but they are regular in shape, not angular as in
Entoloma.

=Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 6–12 lines thick. _Peck_,
44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Woods and open places, and growing from old, matted stable straw. Common
over the United States.

When T. personatum becomes known to the collector, either in the field
or on the table, it is sure to become a favorite. It is fleshy, rotund,
stocky, moist and smooth, with a tendency in its cap to be wavy-rimmed
and jauntily cocked in wet weather. It grows singly or in troops,
occasionally in tufts of from five to six individuals. A patch of it is
valuable and worth husbanding with covering of fine straw. Cortinarius
violaceus resembles it somewhat in color and shape, but it shows a
spidery veil, and has brown spores. It is edible.

The common name of T. personatum in England is Blewits, which translated
into understandable English is believed to be “blue-hats.” It is
everywhere eaten, being of substantial substance, good flavor and
cookable in any way. It is especially fine in patties, stews and
croquettes.


=T. nu´dum= Bull.—naked. =Pileus= about 3 in. broad, becoming
purple-violaceous then changing color, reddish, fleshy, comparatively
_thin_, convexo-plane then _depressed_, obtuse, even, smooth, with a
pellicle which is moist and manifest in rainy weather; margin inflexed,
thin, naked. =Flesh= thin, pliant, colored. =Stem= about 3 in. long, ½
in. thick, _stuffed, elastic_, equal, _almost naked_, mealy at the apex,
_violaceous then becoming pale_. =Gills= rounded then decurrent (on
account of the depressed pileus), crowded, narrow, of the same color as
the pileus or deeper _violaceous_, but soon changing color, at _length
reddish_ without the least tinge of violet. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 7×3.5µ _Massee_; 6–8×4µ _B._; 6×3µ _W.G.S._ On ground among
leaves. Esculent, very good and delicate. _Cordier._ Edible. _Roze._
Edible, all American authorities.

           VII.—HYGROPH´ANA. Pileus thin, water-soaked, etc.

                    * _Gills whitish, not spotted._


=T. grammopo´dium= Bull. _Gr._—a line; _Gr._—a foot. =Pileus= 3–6 in.
broad, _pallid-livid_ or brownish-red when moist, whitish when dry,
fleshy, very thin toward the margin, _campanulate then convex_, and at
length flattened, obtusely umbonate, even, smooth, pellicle moist in
rainy weather, not viscous, separating, flesh-colored when moist, white
when dry, soft, fragile. =Stem= _tall_, about 3–4 in. long, ½ in. and
more thick, _solid_, elastic, equal with exception of the _thickened
base_, cylindrical, firm, smooth, _evidently longitudinally sulcate,
whitish_. =Gills= arcuato-adnate or broadly horizontally emarginate,
acute at both ends, _very crowded, quite entire_, very many shorter,
somewhat branched behind, white.

Odor moldy. Striking in appearance; the chief of this group. There is a
variety wholly white. In pastures and grassy woods. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 5–6µ _Massee_.

Distinguished by the grooved stem and crowded gills, which are adnate
when the pileus is expanded. Often growing in rings.

North Carolina, _Curtis_. Not reported elsewhere. Esculent. _Cooke._
Much eaten in Europe.


=T. bre´vipes= Bull.—_brevis_, short; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= about 2
in. broad, _umber then becoming pale_, fleshy, _soft, convex then
becoming plane_, even, smooth, moist (opaque when dry); flesh of the
pileus _becoming brownish_ when moist, becoming white when dry. =Stem=
_solid_, very _rigid_, at length fibrous, _pruinate at the apex,
externally and internally fuscous_; otherwise very variable, sometimes
_very short_, 2–3 lines only long and thick, attenuated downward;
commonly 1 in., sometimes bulbous, sometimes equal, more slender.
=Gills= emarginato-free, _crowded_, ventricose, disappearing short of
the margin, quite entire, becoming fuscous then whitish. Solitary.
_Inodorous._ The pileus is often stained with soil. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptical, 7.5×5µ _Peck_; 7–4µ _Massee_.

Esculent and very delicate. _Paulet._ Esculent. _Cooke._


=T. hu´mile= Pers.—low, small. (Plate XVIII, fig. 6, p. 60.) Very
variable in form and color. =Cap= 2–3 in. across, convex then expanded,
wavy, flattened, sometimes umbonate, sometimes depressed, glabrous,
occasionally powdered with thin white dust, fragments of veil, sometimes
viscid. =Color= changes with moisture, blackish, grayish, and having
somewhat the appearance of an oyster. =Gills= rounded-adnexed, with a
slight tooth, arcuately decurrent, crowded, 2–3 lines broad, whitish.

with fine down_, stuffed, becoming hollow, soft, fragile. Gregarious,
usually tufted.

=Spores= 7–8×5–6µ _K._

Open woods, in gardens, among cinders, grass, etc., September to frost.

Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia, 1897. _McIlvaine._

Its tufted habit and fair size, fleshy cap of good flavor, make it a
desirable species. It cooks readily and the caps are of fine flavor.


=T. pæ´didum= Fr.—_pædidus_, nasty. =Pileus= about 1-½ in. across.
=Flesh= very thin, tough, becoming whitish; bell-shaped then convex, at
length expanded, umbonate, at length depressed round the conical,
prominent umbo, moist, virgate or streaked with innate fibrils radiating

In gardens, on dung-hills, etc. Small, tough, color dingy, without a
trace of violet tinge. _Massee._

Edible. Cooks tender, and is of good flavor, notwithstanding its name,
which in no way applies.


=T. subpulverulen´tum= Pers.—slightly dusty. =Pileus= 1–2½ in. across,
convex then plane or depressed in center, even, innately pruinose,
hoary, white, whitish, grayish, margin extending as a slight rim

=Spores= 5×3µ _Massee_; 4×3µ _W.G.S._

Biological grounds, University of Pennsylvania. Philadelphia. May to
November, 1898. _McIlvaine._

A species one is glad to find. It has a healthy substantial presence
full of promise. It is a solitary grower among grass on lawns and
pastures, but its individuals are neighborly. Caps and stems are
excellent.

                             CLITO´CYBE Fr.

          _Gr._—sloping. (From the depression of the pileus.)


=Pileus= generally fleshy, becoming thin toward the margin, flexible or
tough, plane or depressed, margin involute. =Gills= adnate or decurrent,
never sinuate. =Stem= confluent and homogeneous with flesh of pileus,
somewhat elastic, with a spongy stuffing, frequently becoming hollow,
externally fibrous. Universal veil when present conspicuous on the
pileus like frost or silky dew, but commonly wanting.

Growing on the ground, frequently in groups. The thinner and
hygrophanous species appear late in autumn. Some are quite fragrant.
Collybia, Mycena and Omphalia are separated by their stems being
cartilaginous, not externally fibrous as in Clitocybe. Tricholoma by its
sinuate gills.

Variations in species of Clitocybe are great. A few are easily fixed in
the genus, but many of them will puzzle the amateur and perplex the
expert. The gills are always attached to the stem, and usually run down
it. They are not notched next to the stem as in Tricholoma.

Like Tricholoma, Clitocybe has many species, most of which are common,
and are probably edible. I therefore give Professor Peck’s description
of all Clitocybes thus far submitted to him.

I know of but one species which is injurious to some persons—Clitocybe
illudens. Many eat and enjoy it. It does not agree with others. A few
untried species are suspicious to a like extent. Clitocybe illudens
possesses the property of phosphorescence.

Several species of Clitocybe have not been seen or tested by me, nor
have I information that these have been tested.

                          ANALYSIS OF TRIBES.

     _A._ PILEUS FLESHY, OFTEN PALLID WHEN DRY, _not hygrophanous_.

Flesh firm, not watery, nor splitting into plates. Those which turn pale
in drying differ from Series _B_ by their silky luster.

                  DISCIFORMES (disk-shaped). Page 85.

Pileus somewhat equally fleshy; convex then plane or depressed, obtuse,
regular; gills at first adnate or regularly adnato-decurrent. Normally
solitary.

* Pileus gray or brownish.

** Pileus violet or reddish.

*** Pileus becoming yellowish.

**** Pileus greenish, becoming pale.

***** Pileus white, becoming shining white.

Distinguished from white hygrophanous species and white species of
Paxillus.

                DIFFORMES (irregularly shaped). Page 94.

Pileus fleshy in the center, thin at the margin, at first umbonate, then
expanded and depressed, irregular. Gills unequally decurrent, longer in
some places than in others, sometimes rounded on one side of the stem or
only reaching it as in Tricholoma. Stem somewhat cartilaginous
externally, but fibrous.

Cespitose, often grown together at base, variable in form, sometimes
solitary.

              INFUNDIBULIFORMES (funnel-shaped). Page 98.

Pileus becoming thin from the fleshy center to the margin, at length
funnel-shaped or deeply umbilicately depressed in the center. Stem
spongy, externally fibrous. Gills deeply and equally decurrent from the
first. Pileus often becoming discolored or pallid, not hygrophanous.

* Pileus colored or becoming pale, the surface (at least under a lens)
innately flocculose or silky, bibulous, not moist.

** Pileus colored or pallid, smooth, moist in rainy weather.

*** Pileus shining whitish, with scattered superficial flocci or
becoming smooth.

                   _B._ PILEUS FLESHY-MEMBRANACEOUS.

Flesh thin, soft, watery, hygrophanous.

                  CYATHIFORMES (cup-shaped). Page 104.

Flesh of pileus thin, consisting of two separable plates, disk not
compact, hygrophanous, depressed then cup-shaped; gills at first adnate
then decurrent, descending, straight. Color dingy when moist.

                  ORBIFORMES (round-shaped). Page 109.

Pileus somewhat fleshy, hygrophanous, convex then flattened or
depressed, polished, not squamulose nor mealy; gills plane, horizontal,
thin, crowded, adnate or decurrent with a small tooth. Color dingy or
becoming watery pale.

* Gills becoming ash-colored. Pileus at first dark.

** Gills whitish. Pileus becoming pale.

               VERSIFORMES (variable in shape). Page 106.

Pileus thin, convex then deformed, tough, more or less squamulose or
furfuraceous; gills adnate, broad, rather thick, generally distant.
Color hygrophanous.

* Pileus squalid or brownish with dark squamules. None known to be
edible.

** Pileus bright, of one color.

                      * _Pileus gray or brownish._


=C. nebula´ris= Batsch.—_nebula_, a cloud. (Plate XXIV, fig. 7, p. 82.)
The Clouded clitocybe, Clitocybe nebularis, takes its name from the
clouded-gray appearance of its thick cap, which is at first convex, but
when mature, either flat or a little depressed. Its flesh is white,
thickest in the middle, and in a vertical section is seen to taper
rapidly downward into the stem. The gills are close together and rather
narrow for the size of the plant. They are white or yellowish-white. The
stout solid stem usually tapers upward from the base and is whitish.

The cap is two to four inches or more broad, the stem one to two inches
long and about half an inch thick. The Clouded mushroom grows in woods,
and sometimes forms large tufts or clusters among fallen leaves. It is
found in autumn, but is not very common in this country. Authors differ
in their estimate of the edible qualities of this mushroom, but the more
recent ones generally agree in classing it as edible. “Mushrooms and
Their Use,” _C.H. Peck_.

=Spores= 4.5×3µ _Cooke_; elliptical 6×3.5µ _Massee_; 3×4µ _W.G.S._

There has been great diversity of opinion as to the edibility of this
species on the continent. Cordier and a friend suffered from it. Paulet
counseled mistrust.

This fungus is quite common in the West Virginia mountains and in some
parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where I have found it. It is,
however, limited to localities. It is one of my favorites, being of
marked flavor and agreeable consistency. I have not known it to harm
anyone.

[Illustration:

  CLITOCYBE CLAVIPES.
  About two-thirds natural size.
]

=C. cla´vipes= Pers.—_clava_, a club; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= 1½-2½ in.
across, rather convex at first, soon plane, at length almost obconical,
very obtuse, even, glabrous, dry, sometimes all one color, brown, sooty,
livid-gray, etc., sometimes whitish towards the margin, very rarely
entirely white. =Flesh= loose in texture, white, thin at the margin.
=Gills= deeply decurrent, continued down the stem as straight lines,
rather distant, flaccid, quite entire, broad, entirely and persistently
white. =Stem= 2 in. long, base ½ in. and more thick, conically
attenuated upward, rather fibrillose, livid, sooty, solid, spongy
within. =Spores= elliptical, 6–7×4µ.

In woods, especially pine. Resembling C. nebularis in color, but quite
distinct. Smell pleasant, entire substance soft and elastic. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, 6–7×4µ _Massee_; sub-ellipsoid, 5–7×3–4µ _K._; 6×8µ
_W.G.S._

Found in pine woods of New Jersey, and under spruce in West Virginia.
Its substance is spongy, therefore does not stew well. Cooked in any
other way it is delicate and of excellent flavor.


=C. gangræno´sa= Fr.—_gangræna_, gangrene. =Pileus= fleshy, convex then
plane, obtuse, whitish, at first sprinkled with white powder, then
naked, variegated, streaked. =Gills= slightly decurrent, arcuate,
crowded, dingy-white. =Stem= somewhat bulbous, soft, striate, spongy,
solid.

Stinking; large, flesh becoming blackish and variegated with black. Stem
curved, sometimes excentric. Pileus whitish, here and there greenish,
livid, etc. _Fries._

Var. _nigres´cens_ Lasch. Whitish; pileus thin, soft, at first convex,
obtuse then plane, somewhat umbonate, and somewhat depressed; gills
decurrent, very much crowded, narrow, stem solid, downy.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1¼-1½ in. long, 2–3 lines thick.

Odor rather sweet, taste unpleasant. _Cooke._

New Jersey, Haddonfield, pine woods. July to August. _McIlvaine._

This Clitocybe is in every way unattractive. It is not poisonous, but no
one would care to eat it.


(Plate XXVI.)

[Illustration:

  CLITOCYBE MEDIA.
  One-half natural size.
]

=C. me´dia= Pk.—_medius_, middle. Because intermediate between C.
nebularis and C. clavipes. =Pileus= fleshy, convex, becoming plane or
slightly depressed, dry, dark grayish-brown, the margin often wavy or
irregular, flesh white, taste mild. =Gills= broad, subdistant, adnate or
decurrent, whitish, the interspaces somewhat venose. =Stem= equal or but
slightly thickened at the base, solid, elastic, not polished, colored
like or a little paler than the pileus. =Spores= elliptical, 8×5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 4–8 lines thick. Mossy
ground in deep woods. North Elba. September.

This species is intermediate between C. nebularis and C. clavipes. In
its general appearance, and in the character of the pileus and stem, it
resembles C. nebularis, but in the character of the more distant gills
and in the size of the spores it is nearer C. clavipes, of which it
might perhaps be regarded as a variety. Two forms are distinguishable.
In one the gills are more distant, slightly rounded behind, and adnate
or abruptly terminated; in the other they are closer and more distinctly
decurrent. The plant is edible. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

I have known this fungus very favorably since 1883, and regard it as one
of the best. I have seen it in the West Virginia mountains only, but it
will probably be found in cool, shaded, high localities all over the
country. Both it and the C. nebularis are well worthy of search.


=C. viles´cens= Pk.—_vilesco_, of little value. =Pileus= convex, then
plane or depressed, often irregular, glabrous, slightly pruinose on the
involute margin, brown or grayish-brown, becoming paler with age, often
concentrically rivulose. =Gills= close, adnate or decurrent, cinereous,
sometimes tinged with dingy-yellow. =Stem= short, solid, sometimes
compressed, grayish-brown, with a whitish tomentum at the base. =Spores=
subglobose or broadly elliptical, 5–6.5µ; flesh whitish-gray, odor
slight.

=Plant= gregarious, 1–2 in. high. =Pileus= 1–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2
lines thick. Grassy pastures. Jamesville, August. _Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

A pale form of this species grows on sandy soil, in which the pileus is
smoky white, but it becomes grayish-brown in drying. The mycelium binds
together a mass of sand, so that when the plant is taken up carefully a
little ball of sandy soil adheres to the base of the stem. The stem is
sometimes pruinose. The flavor is mild and agreeable. _Peck_, 50th Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

Sometimes plentiful about Philadelphia. Edible. Caps tender, slight
flavor.


=C. comitia´lis= Fr.—belonging to an assembly. =Pileus= about 1½ in.
across, fleshy, convex, then plane, obtuse, even, glabrous, rather moist
but not hygrophanous, every part colored alike, sooty-umber, almost
black. =Flesh= firm, white. =Gills= very slightly decurrent, horizontal,
plane, thin, crowded, white. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3–4 lines thick,
equally attenuated upward from the base, glabrous, sooty, elastic,
stuffed. =Spores= elliptical, 7–8×4µ.

Damp places among mosses in pine woods, etc. Distinguished by the
blackish color of the almost flat pileus, and the very slightly
decurrent gills. Somewhat allied to C. clavipes, but firmer, smaller and
inodorous. _Massee._

Rather rare. Found in New Jersey among pines; in Pennsylvania in mixed
woods.

Edible. Good texture and flavor.

                        ** _Violet or reddish._


=C. cyanophæ´a= Fr. _Gr._—blue. =Pileus= 3–4 in. broad, becoming
bluish-dusky-brown, compact, convex then plane, obtuse, smooth. =Stem= 3
in. long, 1 in. thick at the base, attenuated upward, robust, solid,
smooth, _becoming azure-blue_ when young, _abruptly white at the apex_.
=Gills= deeply decurrent, crowded, violaceous, then becoming pale.

New York, Albion. In woods. October. Edible. _Dr. E.L. Cushing._

Specimens sent to me by Dr. Cushing are the first and only ones of the
species I have seen. The description is accurate. The spores were cream
color.


=C. monadel´pha= Morg.—_monas_, single; _adelphos_, a brother. From its
cespitose habit. (Plate XXVII.) Densely cespitose. =Pileus= fleshy,
convex then depressed, at first glabrous, then scaly, honey color,
varying to pallid-brownish or reddish. =Stem= elongated, solid, crooked,
twisted, fibrous, tapering at the base, pallid-brownish or flesh color.
=Gills= short, decurrent, not crowded, pallid flesh color. =Spores=
white, a little irregular, 7.5×5.5µ.

On the ground in wet woods, spring to late autumn. =Pileus= 1–3 in.
=Stem= 3–7 in. _Morgan._

Grassy places. Menands. Albany county. September. Edible. Resembling
Armillaria mellea, but distinguished from it by the absence of a collar
from the stem, by the more decidedly decurrent lamellæ and by the solid
stem. It is also more agreeable in flavor. It is related to C. illudens
in habit and manner of growth. _Peck_, 51st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 8×5µ _Peck_.

October 15, 1898. Identified by Professor Peck. September until frost.

Grows in great clusters about roots, etc., at Mt. Gretna. Frequently
much water-soaked and uninviting. Taste variable, sometimes strong,
woody.

It is edible, but care should be exercised in collecting to get young,
fresh groups.


=C. socia´lis= Fr.—_socius_, a companion. =Pileus= about 1 in. broad,
pale-yellowish with a reddish tinge, fleshy, convex then expanded,
acutely umbonate especially when young, even, smooth, dry. =Flesh=
moderately thin, white. =Stem= 1 in. long, 2 lines or a little more
thick, solid, fibrous, commonly ascending, smooth, reddish, the rooting
base hairy. =Gills= plano-decurrent, scarcely crowded, becoming yellow.
_Fries._

A very pretty species, densely gregarious, inodorous. The stem is
sheathed-hairy at the base like Marasmius peronatus. Its greatest
affinity is with A. vernicosus, of which it is perhaps a variety.
_Stevenson._

Quite common in pine woods of New Jersey. Though small, goodly messes of
it may be gathered from its patches. The caps make a pleasing dish.


                     *** _Pileus becoming yellow._

None reported as tested for edibility.


               **** _Pileus greenish or becoming pallid._


=C. odo´ra= Bull.—_odorus_, fragrant. (Plate XXIV, fig. 9, p. 82.)
Fragrant. =Pileus= about 2 in. across, flesh rather thick, tough; soon
plane and wavy, even, smooth, pale dingy green, silky when dry. =Gills=
adnate, rather close, broad, greenish or pallid. =Stem= about 1–1½ in.
long, 2 lines thick, base incrassated, elastic, stuffed. =Spores=
elliptical, 6–8×4–5µ. In woods. _Massee._

Readily distinguished by the strong, aniseed smell, dingy bluish-green
pileus, and the pallid or greenish gills.

Sometimes somewhat cespitose. Tough; size variable, color varies between
pale green and greenish-gray, usually all colored alike, but the gills
are sometimes white; smell pleasant, spicy, especially when dry.
_Fries._

=Spores= 6×5µ _K._; 8×4µ _B._

A rather delicate, even exquisite dish. _Cooke._

Edible. Exceedingly spicy. The flavor is pleasant, but rather strong. A
few specimens mixed with others of like texture but less flavor make a
tasty dish.


=C. rivulo´sa= Pers.—_rivus_, a stream. (Named from rivulet-like streaks
on pileus.) =Pileus= 1–3 in. across, flesh thin, convex then plane and
depressed, obtuse, often undulately lobed, dingy flesh-color or reddish,
becoming pale, glabrous, then covered with a whitish down. =Gills=
slightly decurrent, broad, rather crowded, pinkish-white. =Stem= about 2
in. long, 3–4 lines thick, rather fibrillose, tough, elastic, whitish,
stuffed. =Spores= elliptical, 6×3.5µ. _Massee._

Among grass by road-sides, etc.

Not common, but when found it is basket-filling. I have found it in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West Virginia.

Edible. The caps are rather tough but become glutinous and tender when
well cooked. Flavor fine.


                ***** _Pileus white, shining when dry._


=C. cerussa´ta= Fr.—_cerussa_, white lead. =Pileus= 1½-3 in. across,
flesh thick at the disk, becoming thin toward the margin; convex then
almost plane, obtuse, even, minutely floccose then almost glabrous,
white. =Gills= adnate, then decurrent, very much crowded, thin,
permanently white. =Stem= about 2 in. long, 3–5 lines thick, smooth,
tough, elastic, naked, spongy and solid, white. Among dead leaves, etc.

Taste mild, smell almost obsolete. Stem rather thickened at the base and
often tomentose. Pileus said to be gibbous, but not umbonate nor
becoming rufescent. Gills not changing to yellowish. _Fries._

=Spores= 3µ _W.G.S._

Edible. Good.


=C. phylloph´ila= Fr. _Gr._—leaf-loving. Whitish-tan. =Pileus= 1–3 in.
across, rather fleshy, convex then plane, becoming umbilicate and
depressed, sometimes wavy, smooth and even. =Gills= thin, subdistant,
white then tinged with ocher, rather broad, very slightly decurrent.
=Stem= 2–3 in. long, equal, stuffed then hollow, whitish, tough,
silky-fibrillose. =Spores= 6×4µ.

Among leaves in woods, etc.

=Spores= 6×4µ _Massee_; 6×3µ _W.G.S._; 5.5×2.8µ _Morgan_.

Found at Devon, Pa., 1888; Angora, West Philadelphia, 1897. It is equal
to the Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) in texture, but not so high
in flavor. Well cooked it is an agreeable and valuable food.


=C. pithyoph´ila= Secr. _Gr._—pine-loving. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad,
dead-white when moist, shining whitish when dry, fleshy but _thin_,
rather plane, _umbilicate_, at length irregularly shaped, repand and
undulato-lobed, even, _smooth, flaccid_, the margin slightly striate
when old. =Stem= _somewhat hollow_, rounded then compressed, equal,
even, smooth, obsoletely or scarcely pruinose at the apex, white
tomentose at the (not bulbous) base. =Gills= adnate, somewhat decurrent,
_very crowded_, plane, 2–3 lines broad, distinct, quite entire, white.

Odor not remarkable, but pleasant. Gregarious, somewhat cespitose;
_white_ indeed, but when moist watery and _somewhat hygrophanous_, in
which it evidently differs from A. phyllophila. A. tuba, which appears
in the same places, is very like it. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 6–7×4µ _B._

Massachusetts, _Sprague_; New York, _Peck_, Bull. 1887.

Albion, Orleans county, N.Y., October, 1898, _Dr. Cushing_.

Several specimens received were clearly referable to C. pithyophila,
though varying in having caps deeply depressed but not umbilicate. The
white tomentosity at base was present but indistinct.

Four specimens were eaten and found good. Eaten enjoyably by Dr.
Cushing.


=C. fus´cipes= Pk.—_fuscus_, dirty; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= thin,
broadly convex or plane, umbilicate, glabrous, whitish and striatulate
when moist, pure white when dry, odor and taste farinaceous. =Gills=
nearly plane, subdistant, adnate or slightly decurrent, white. =Stem=
equal, glabrous or slightly mealy at the top, hollow, dingy brown when
moist, paler when dry. =Spores= globose, 5–6µ.

=Pileus= 4–8 lines broad. =Stem= about 1 in. long. Under pine trees.
Carrollton. September. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Edible. Its small size gives it minor importance, but a quantity of it
makes an excellent meal.


=C. can´dicans= Pers.—_candico_, to be shining white. Entirely white.
=Pileus= about 1 in. across, flesh thin, convex then plane or slightly
depressed, umbilicate, regular or slightly excentric, even, with an
adpressed silkiness, shining, shining white when dry. =Gills= adnate
then slightly decurrent, crowded, very thin, narrow, straight. =Stem=
1–2 in. long, 1–2 lines thick, even, glabrous, cartilaginous, polished,
equal, hollow, base incurved, rooting, downy. =Spores= broadly
elliptical or subglobose, 5–6×4µ. _Massee._

Among damp fallen leaves, etc.

Entirely white, small, rather tough; approaching Omphalia in the
structure of the stem. The following form is described by Fries as
occurring in pine woods: Stem thin, flexuous, base glabrous; pileus
plane, not umbilicate, naked (without silky down). Gills scarcely
decurrent.

A remarkable form but scarcely to be separated as a species. _Fries._

Quite common in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. The caps are
excellent when well cooked.


=C. dealba´ta= Sow.—_dealbo_, to whitewash. =Pileus= about 1 in. or a
little more broad, white, _slightly fleshy, tough_, convex then plane
and at length revolute and undulated, always dry (not watery in rainy
weather), even, smooth, _somewhat shining_, but as if innately pruinose
under a lens. =Flesh= thin, arid, white. =Stem= 1 in. long, 2 lines
thick, _stuffed, wholly fibrous_, at length also tubed, equal, but often
ascending, whitish, mealy at the apex. =Gills= _adnate_, scarcely
decurrent, thin, _crowded_, white.

=Pileus= sometimes orbicular, sometimes upturned and wavy. _Odor weak,
pleasant_, but not very remarkable. Most distinct from A. candicans in
the nature of the stem.

Edible. Its top is _exceedingly like ivory_. Its charming flavor is
exceeded by very few other fungi. _Stevenson._

Among leaves and grass. Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia.

This charming fungus is common over the land. I have known it since
1881, and found it from North Carolina to West Virginia.


=C. robus´ta= Pk.—_robustus_, stout. =Pileus= thick, firm, at first
convex, soon plane or slightly depressed in the center, glabrous, white,
the margin at first involute or decurved, naked. =Flesh= white. =Gills=
narrow, close, decurrent, whitish. =Stem= stout, rather short, solid,
glabrous, equal or slightly tapering upward, often with a bulbous base,
white. =Spores= elliptical, 8×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 3–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 8–12 lines thick.

Woods among fallen leaves. Catskill mountains. September to November.

This large and robust fungus is closely allied to C. candida Bres., from
which it differs in the naked margin of the pileus, the absence of any
marked odor and especially in the more elliptical shape of its spores.
The same plant has been collected in Maryland by Mr. L.J. Atwater, who
considers it edible, having eaten it with satisfaction and safety.
_Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

This fungus is quite plentiful in Pennsylvania and in open oak woods in
New Jersey. Its size and sometimes gregarious growth give it a permanent
food value. Its texture is coarse, but when cooked it is highly
satisfactory.


=C. gallina´cea= Scop.—_gallina_, a hen. Application not apparent.
White; acrid. =Pileus= 1–1½ in. across, rather fleshy at the disk,
margin thin; convex then depressed, but not funnel-shaped, even, dry,
opaque. =Gills= slightly decurrent, narrow, crowded, thin. =Stem= about
1½ in. long, 2 lines thick, equal, even, solid. Among grass, moss, etc.

Resembling C. dealbata in form, but smaller, opaque, dingy-white, taste
somewhat acrid. Stem solid, but not cartilaginous, about 2 in. long,
equal, ascending or flexuous, excentric, at first floccosely mealy,
always opaque, white. Pileus slightly fleshy, convex then plane, not
depressed, obtuse, ½-1 in. broad, unequal, dry, pruinosely hoary; flesh
white, compact, but thin. Gills adnato-decurrent, thin, crowded, plane.
_Fries._

It loses its acridity in cooking and is quite equal to C. dealbata.


=C. trunci´cola= Pk.—_truncus_, trunk of a tree. =Pileus= thin, firm,
expanded or slightly depressed in the center, smooth, dry, white.
=Gills= narrow, thin, crowded, adnate-decurrent. =Stem= equal, stuffed,
smooth, often excentric and curved, whitish.

=Plant= 1 in. high. =Pileus= 1 in. broad. =Stem= 1 line thick.

Trunks of frondose trees, especially maples. _Croghan._ September.
_Peck_, 26th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 5×3.5µ _Morgan_.

Found on maple trees in West Philadelphia, Pa. Edible. Good quality.

=C. decas´tes= Fr. _Gr._—a decade; a number of ten. From the stems being
often joined in bundles of about ten. Densely cespitose. =Pileus= 5–12
in. across, soon almost plane, disk gibbous or obtuse; margin at first
shortly incurved, then expanded, very much waved and often lobed, even,
glabrous, dingy-brown or livid when moist, pale clay-color when dry.
=Flesh= exceedingly thin except at the disk, whitish. =Stem= 4–7 in.
long, ½-1½ in. thick, usually slightly thinner upward, rather soft,
entirely fibrous, solid, white, usually curved and ascending, coalescent
into a solid mass at the base. =Gills= adnato-decurrent, or often more
or less adnexed, up to ½ in. broad, rather narrowed towards the margin,
often wavy. =Spores= globose, smooth, 4µ diameter.

On the ground and on sawdust.

Albion, Orleans county, N.Y., _Dr. Cushing_. October, 1898.

On ground in grassy places (Woodland Cemetery, May 22, 1897).
_McIlvaine._

Particularly welcome to toadstool lovers are the early comers. The
present species is among the first. It is rich in quantity, substance
and flavor.


=C. mul´ticeps= Pk.—_multus_, many; _caput_, a head. (Plate XXVII_a_, p.
94.) =Pileus= fleshy, thin except on the disk, firm, convex, slightly
moist in wet weather, whitish, grayish or yellowish-gray. =Flesh= white,
taste mild. =Gills= close, adnate and slightly decurrent, whitish.
=Stems= densely cespitose, equal or slightly thickened at the base,
solid or stuffed, firm, elastic, slightly pruinose at the apex, whitish.
=Spores= globose, 5–8µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Open places, grassy ground, etc. Albany and Sandlake. June and October.
This species forms dense tufts, often composed of many individuals. In
this respect it is related to such species as C. tumulosa, C. aggregata
and C. illudens. From the crowding together of many individuals the
pileus is often irregular. Sometimes the disk is brownish and
occasionally slightly silky. The gills are sometimes slightly sinuate,
thus indicating a relationship to the species of Tricholoma. The taste,
though mild, is somewhat oily and unpleasant. The plants appear in wet,
rainy weather, either early in the season or in autumn. Specimens have
been sent to me from Massachusetts by R.K. Macadam and Professor Farlow,
and from Pennsylvania by Dr. W. Herbst. _Peck_, 43d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, New Jersey, Mt. Gretna, Pa. In May, and in autumn months.
Very variable in size, color, shape of gills, texture and taste.
_McIlvaine._

The early spring clusters are remarkable for their tenderness and
excellence. Clusters of hundreds of individuals grew abundantly at Mt.
Gretna in May, 1899. When the fungus was young the gills were sometimes
adnate, almost free, often decurrent. The varying color of oysters is
well seen in C. multiceps.

Edible. They should be well cooked. The addition of a little lemon juice
or sherry conceals a slight raw taste sometimes present.

=C. illu´dens= Schw.—mocking, deceiving. (Plate XXIX_a_, p. 96.)
=Pileus= fleshy, convex or expanded, smooth, generally with a small
umbo. =Gills= not crowded, unequally decurrent, some of them branched,
narrowed toward each end, the edge, in dry specimens, discolored. =Stem=
firm, solid, long, smooth, tapering at the base.

=Height= 5–8 in., breadth of pileus 4–6 in. =Stem= 6–8 lines thick.

=Spores= 4–5µ _Peck_.

Grows in clumps or large masses about stumps or decaying trees from
August to October. Its bright, deep yellow is attractive from a
distance. As many as fifty plants may form a cluster. Cap from 2–6 in.,
fleshy, convex or expanded, often with a raised center directly over the
stem; flesh juicy and yellow; gills yellow, widely separated, running
down stem unequally; stem long, firm, solid, smooth, tapering toward
base. When cooked the taste is rather saponaceous. Strong stomachs can
retain a meal of them, but the fungus generally sickens the eater. Many
testings show it to contain a minor poison. It is not deadly, but should
not be eaten. Bull. No. 2, Phila. Myc. Center.

New York, _Peck_, Rep. 23–49. Well known in southern states. Indiana,
_H.I. Miller_.

The mysterious property of phosphorescence is possessed by this fungus.
As heat is known to develop in masses of the fungus it is of interest to
know whether it is from the phosphorescence or a ferment. Its radiance
by night surpasses its splendor by day. Mr. H.I. Miller, of Terre Haute,
Ind., first drew the writer’s attention to this quality. A large box of
specimens sent by him retained their luminous quality after three days
of travel to such an extent that the print of a newspaper could be read
when held close to the mass.

Mr. Miller writes: “There is something about this fungus which generates
heat. When I bring in a basketful of it, for the pleasure its
phosphorescence affords my friends, I find that after having been in the
basket for two or three hours, and while piled one bunch upon top of
another, that to insert one’s hand among the different clusters is like
putting it close to a hot stove.”

This fungus is so inviting in quantity and beauty that one turns from it
with a regret that lingers. Eaten in quantity it acts upon some persons
as an emetic. I have several times eaten of it without other than
pleasurable sensations, but persons partaking of the same cooking have
been sickened.


=C. fumo´sa= Pers.—_fumus_, smoke. =Pileus= 1–3 in. across, fleshy,
margin thin; convex, often gibbous when young, regular or wavy, even,
pellicle not separable, glabrous, sooty-brown, soon livid or gray when
dry. =Gills= adnate in regular forms, but often decurrent when the
pileus is irregular, crowded, distinct, grayish-white from the first.
=Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3–6 lines thick, almost equal, often twisted or
curved, glabrous, dingy-white, apex mealy, solid, fibrous. =Spores=
subglobose, 5–6µ diam.

In woods. Autumn.

Gregarious, somewhat cespitose, tough, rather cartilaginous. Pileus
truly obtuse, never streaked, often regular. Smell none. _Fries._

Var. _po´lius_. Densely and connately cespitose. =Pileus= convex, then
plane, obtuse, smooth, gray. =Stem= flexuous, smooth. =Gills= crowded,
whitish. Edible. _Cooke_, 1891.

Var. polius found growing in large quantities in Boston navy yard in
stone barn. Determined by Professor Peck. A fair edible. _R.K. Macadam._

This woods-growing Clitocybe has been many times found by me in a
hot-house in Haddonfield, N.J. Professor Peck confirmed my
identification. Either its spores or mycelium had evidently been carried
thither in the wood-earth used by florists. The hot-house crops appeared
in March, and continued until June.

Several of the plants showed an effort to comply with some condition
unusual to them, by producing gills upon the upper side of the pileus.
Those below were venose and crisped.

This wild species had thus been brought into cultivation. The cultivated
plants were much more tender than the wild. Both are excellent.


=C. connex´a= Pk.—_connexus_, joined. From its relation to Tricholoma.
=Pileus= thin, convex or expanded, subumbonate, clothed with a minute
appressed silkiness, white, the margin sometimes faintly tinged with
blue. =Gills= crowded, narrow, white inclining to yellowish. =Stem=
equal or tapering downward, solid, whitish.

=Plant= 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2 lines thick.

Ground in woods. Croghan. September.

The gills sometimes terminate rather abruptly and are not strongly
decurrent, hence it might easily be mistaken for a Tricholoma. The
margin of the pileus is sometimes marked with slight ridges as in Ag.
laterarius. The odor is weak but aromatic and agreeable. _Peck_, 26th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found in plenty in oak woods near Philadelphia, and in West Virginia; a
few specimens in southern New Jersey. Autumn.

Edible, and quite equal to most of the Clitocybes.


=C. tumulo´sa= Kalchbr.—_tumulus_, a mound. Cespitose. =Pileus= 1–2 in.
across, disk fleshy, margin thin; conico-convex then expanded, obtusely
umbonate or obtuse, even, glabrous, brownish-umber, becoming pale,
margin drooping. =Gills= more or less decurrent or slightly emarginate,
crowded narrow, white, then grayish. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, unequal,
usually thicker below, minutely downy, pallid, solid.

On the ground in woods. Spring and autumnal months. Readily
distinguished by the densely clustered habit, and the umber pileus. The
gills are very variable, sometimes distinctly decurrent, at others
rounded behind, and almost resembling a Tricholoma. =Spores= subglobose,
5–6µ. _Massee._

California, _H. and M._; New York, _Peck_, Rep. 42.

Sent to me by Mrs. Mary Fuller, Washington, D.C. The specimens eaten
were of good consistency and flavor.

                        III.—INFUNDIBULFOR´MES.

 * _Pileus colored or becoming pale, etc., surface innately flocculose or
                            silky; not moist._


=C. gigante´a= Sow.—_giganteus_, of gigantic size. =Pileus= 6–10 in.
across. =Flesh= rather thin in proportion to the size of the fungus,
white, or tinged with tan, glabrous when moist, slightly flocculose when
dry; margin involute then spreading, glabrous, rather coarsely grooved.
=Gills= slightly decurrent, broad, very much crowded, branched and
connected by veins, whitish then pale tan-color, not separating
spontaneously from the hymenophore. =Stem= 1–2 in. long and nearly the
same in thickness, equal, pallid, solid. =Spores= white, 5×3µ.

In woods, etc.

A very distinct species, very showy, large, subcespitose, entirely
whitish tan-color; without close affinities. Stem solid, compact, and
firm inside and outside, 2½ in. long, ½ in. thick, equal, even,
glabrous. Pileus depressed from the first, then broadly, _i. e._,
plano-infundibuliform, thin but equally fleshy, soft, not flaccid, but
easily splitting from the margin toward the center (almost papery and
involute when old), upward of a foot broad, often excentric and
generally sinuately lobed, moist and adpressedly downy when growing,
slightly flocculose and cracked into scales when dry; margin at first
very thin, involute, pubescent, soon spreading, glabrous, at length
revolute, coarsely furrowed or radiately wrinkled. Gills slightly
decurrent, closely crowded, almost 3 lines broad (2–3 times as broad as
thickness of flesh of pileus), connected by veins, thin, fragile,
straight, but sometimes varying to crisped and anastomosing, whitish
then yellowish or tinged with rufous, smell weak. _Fries._

This species was placed in Clitocybe in Syst. Myc. and Epicrisis, but in
Hym. Europ. Fries removed it to Paxillus in which he is followed by
Stevenson. Cooke and Massee continue it in Clitocybe. Dr. Somers found
one measuring over 15 inches in diameter. _R.K.M._

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_. Edible, _Curtis_; Wisconsin, _Bundy_;
California, _H. and M._; Nova Scotia, _Dr. Somers_.

Large quantities of Clitocybe gigantea grow in the West Virginia
mountains, and in woods around Philadelphia. July to November.

Its substance is coarse, but of good flavor. It should be chopped fine.


=C. max´ima= Gärtn and Meyer. (Fl. Wett.)—greatest. (Plate XXIV, fig. 5,
page 82.) =Pileus= as much as 1 foot broad, becoming pale-tan or
whitish, _fleshy_, compact at the disk, otherwise thin, _somewhat
flaccid_ (not capable of being split), broadly funnel-shaped, gibbous
_with a central umbo_, always very dry, the surface _becoming
silky-even_ or squamulose; margin involute, pubescent, always _even_.
=Flesh= white, at length soft. =Stem= as much as 4 in. long, 1 in.
thick, solid, compact, but internally spongy, _elastic_, attenuated
upward, fibrillosestriate, whitish. =Gills= _deeply decurrent_, pointed
at both ends, somewhat crowded, soft, simple, _whitish_, not changeable.

The pileus is always very dry because the surface absorbs moisture. Odor
weak, pleasant, almost that of A. infundibuliformis. On account of its
gigantic stature and color, it has often been interchanged with A.
gigantea Sow.; it is in no wise, however, allied to that species, but is
so closely allied to A. infundibuliformis that it might be taken for a
very luxuriant form of it. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 6×4µ _Massee_; 5×3µ, _W.G.S._

New England, _Frost_; California, _H. and M._

Common in the West Virginia mountains, mixed woods in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. June to November. _McIlvaine._

It is coarse, dry, hard, but chopped fine and cooked in various ways,
either by itself or with meats, it is a good food.


=C. infundibulifor´mis= Schaeff.—_infundibulum_, a funnel; _forma_,
form. (Plate XXIV, fig. 11, p. 82.) The Funnel-form clitocybe, Clitocybe
infundibuliformis, is a neat and pretty species easily recognized by the
funnel shape of its mature cap and by its pale red color. When very
young the cap is slightly convex and often adorned with a slight umbo in
its center. As it matures the margin becomes elevated so that the cap
assumes a shape somewhat resembling that of a wine glass. The margin is
sometimes wavy. The flesh is thin and white. The gills are close, thin,
white or whitish and decurrent. The stem is smooth, colored like or a
little paler than the cap and mostly tapering from the base upward.

The cap is 2–3 in. broad, the stem 1½-3 in. long and ¼-½ in. thick.

The funnel-shaped mushroom grows in woods or copses in summer and
autumn, especially in wet seasons. It is somewhat variable in color, but
is usually a pale-red, tinged with buff, and sometimes becoming more
pale with age. It delights to grow among fallen leaves, and often there
is an abundant white cottony mycelium at the base of the stem. When it
grows in clusters the caps are apt to be irregular because of mutual
pressure. “Mushrooms and Their Use.” _Peck._

=Spores= 5–6×3–4µ _B._

Very common and in plenty after rains, when large patches of it may be
found. I have usually found the light pinkish-buff color to abound, and
the stem thinner than described by Prof. Peck. Size of cap from 1–3 in.

It is a good, reliable food species. The stem should be removed, and the
caps well cooked.


      ** _Pileus colored or pallid, smooth, moist in wet weather._


=C. subzonal´is= Pk.—_sub_, under; _zonalis_, pertaining to a zone.
=Pileus= thin, centrally depressed or subinfundibuliform, marked with
two or three obscure zones, with a slight appressed silkiness, pale
yellow. =Gills= close, narrow, equally decurrent, some of them forked,
pallid or yellowish. =Stem= equal, slightly fibrillose, stuffed, pale
yellow.

=Plant= 2 in. high. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 lines thick.

Ground in woods. _Croghan._ September. _Peck_, 26th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found in oak woods, Angora, West Philadelphia, growing singly. Specimens
few. Edible; pleasant.


=C. gil´va= Pers.—_gilvus_, pale brownish-yellow. =Pileus= 2–4 in.
broad, _pale yellowish, fleshy, compact, convex then depressed_, very
obtuse, even, smooth, _dampish when fresh_, polished and _shining_ when
dry, here and there spotted as with drops, the margin remaining long
involute. =Flesh= compact, not laxly floccose, but at length fragile,
_somewhat of the same color as the pileus_. =Stem= 1–2 in. and more
long, ½ in. and more thick, _solid, fleshy_, stout, not elastic,
somewhat equal, smooth, paler than the pileus, villous at the base.
=Gills= decurrent, thin, _very much crowded_, often _branched_, arcuate,
narrow, _pallid then ochraceous_.

Odor not remarkable. The stem has been noticed at length also hollow,
perhaps eroded by larvæ. It corresponds with the Paxilli. The primary
form, which is very different from all the rest, is curt, obese, robust,
scarcely ever infundibuliform. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 4–5×5µ _K._; 4–5µ _Massee_.

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Pennsylvania, _Schweinitz_; New
York, _Peck_, R. 51, under pines. July to September.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. July, 1898, ground, mixed woods. _McIlvaine._

=Pileus= 1–2½ in. across, depressed, almost infundibuliform, smooth.
=Color= varied lemon to bright orange. =Flesh= lemon color throughout.
=Gills= varying in color, usually same color as pileus. =Stem= all of
one color, same as pileus, stuffed, sometimes short, and pointed,
sometimes thickened at base. Taste and smell pleasant. Edible; good.


=C. subinvolu´ta= Batsch.—turned under at the margin. =Pileus= brick
color, convex, depressed, smooth, margin closely involute. =Flesh=
pallid. =Stem= paler, stout, straight, somewhat equal, veined on the
lower part with oblique coalescing slightly elevated wrinkles, tomentose
and inclining to flesh color above toward the gills, base obtuse.
=Gills= decurrent, rather broad, of the same color as the pileus.

The stem is rough on the surface and destitute of luster. It resembles
Paxillus involutus in size and habit, in the crenate and involute margin
of the pileus, and in the stem being obsoletely veined at the base and
tomentose toward the gills. _Stevenson._

New England, _Frost_; New York, _Peck_, Rep. 22.

Edible, _Cooke_.


=C. geo´tropa= Bull. _Gr._—the earth; _Gr._—to turn. From the turned
down margin. =Pileus= 2–5 in. across. =Flesh= thick, white convex, then
plane and finally more or less depressed, obtusely umbonate, the
prominence remaining after the pileus becomes depressed, very smooth,
even, margin thin, incurved, downy, pale pinkish-tan or buff. =Gills=
decurrent, crowded, narrow, simple, white, then colored like the pileus.
=Stem= 3–5 in. long, 1 in. or more thick at the base, slightly
attenuated upward, compact, fibrillose, colored like the pileus or
paler, solid. =Spores= elliptical, 6–7×4–5µ. _Massee._

In woods and on their borders. Often in rings or troops.

Differs from C. maxima in being firmer, glabrous, and color much more
variable; from C. gilva in the thinner pileus, less crowded gills, and
white flesh.

=Spores= 5–7µ _W.G.S._

In England and on the continent it is considered excellent and superior
to most edible fungi.

Found in West Virginia, 1881; Haddonfield, N J., 1891. Spring and
autumn. _McIlvaine._

Edible, coarse, dry. In stews and mixed to form croquettes or patties,
it is a desirable species, owing to its plentifulness.


=C. splen´dens= Pers.—_splendens_, shining. Solitary. =Pileus= 2–3 in.
across, flesh rather thick, white, plane then depressed or
funnel-shaped, glabrous, shining, yellowish. =Gills= deeply decurrent,
narrow, crowded, simple, white. =Stem= about 1 in. long, 3 lines thick,
glabrous, colored like the pileus, solid, slightly thickened at the base
or equal. _Massee._

In woods, among pine leaves, etc.

Intermediate between C. gilva and C. flaccida. The typical form of C.
gilva differs in the compact pileus, often with drop-like markings, the
very much crowded, somewhat branched, pale ochraceous gills and flesh.
_Fries._

Sent to me from Trenton, N.J., by E.B. Sterling.

Edible; quality good, deficient in flavor.


=C. inver´sus= Scop.—_inverto_, inverted. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across.
=Flesh= thin, fragile; convex, soon funnel-shaped, margin involute,
glabrous, even, reddish or dull brownish-orange. =Gills= decurrent,
simple, pallid then reddish. =Stem= about 1½ in. long, 2 lines thick,
glabrous, rather rigid, paler than the pileus, stuffed, soon hollow.
=Spores= subglobose, 4µ diameter. _Massee._

Among leaves, etc.

Gregarious, subcespitose, forming very large tufts, especially late in
the autumn, deformed. Smell peculiar, slightly acid. Stem sometimes
stuffed, usually hollow, hence compressed, rather rigid and corticated
outside, not elastic, without a bulb, glabrous, whitish; the somewhat
rooting base with white down, and often growing together in tufts,
variously deformed, curved, ascending, etc. _Fries._

=Spores= subglobose, 4µ _Massee_; 3µ _W.G.S._

Closely resembles C. infundibuliformis, but differs from it in the color
of gills and flesh. The entire plant is dark in color. Solitary; in
troops; cespitose.

Found in mixed woods. Haddonfield, N.J. Summer and autumn.

That part of the plant which readily breaks away from the stem is tender
and of good flavor. The remainder is tough.


=C. flac´cida= Sow.—_flaccidus_, limp. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across, flaccid,
orbicular, umbilicate, umbo persistently absent, margin spreading,
arched, glabrous, even, rarely cracking into minute squamules,
tawny-rust colored, shining, not becoming pale. =Flesh= thin, pallid,
rather fragile when fresh, but quite flaccid when dry. =Gills= deeply
decurrent, arcuate, crowded, narrow, about 1 line broad, white, then
tinged yellowish. =Stem= imperfectly hollow, elastic, tough, 1–2 in.
long, 2–3 lines thick somewhat equal, polished, naked, reddish-rust
color, base thickened, downy. =Spores= subglobose, 4–5×3–4µ.

Among leaves, etc. Gregarious, stems often grown together at the base.
Sometimes solitary and regular. Summer and autumn. _Massee._

=Spores= subglobose, 4–5×3–4µ.

Found in 1886 in West Philadelphia—oak woods. Since in New Jersey, North
Carolina, and interior of Pennsylvania.

Edible. Well cooked it compares favorably with C. infundibuliformis and
others of like texture.


                      *** _Pileus shining white._


=C. cati´na= Fr.—_catinus_, a bowl. =Pileus= 2 in. broad, at first
_white, in no wise hygrophanous_, then passing into pale flesh-color
during rain, and into tan-color in dry weather, _fleshy_, moderately
thin, plane then funnel-shaped, always obtuse, even, _smooth_. =Flesh=
thin, _flaccid_, white. =Stem= 3 in. long, 1½ in. thick, _stuffed_,
internally spongy, _elastic_, tough, thickened and tomentose at the
base. =Gills= decurrent, _straight, descending_, not horizontal, broad,
not much _crowded_, persistently white. _Fries._

Ray Brook, Adirondack mountains. August. The pileus is at first white,
but in wet weather it becomes pallid or discolored with age. The plants
were found growing among pieces of bark of arbor vitæ lying on the
ground. _Peck_, 43d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Quite common in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. Woods among
dead leaves. August until frost.

Edible. Excellent in flavor and quality.

                           IV.—CYATHIFOR´MES.


=C. cyathifor´mis= Bull.—_cyathus_, a cup; _formis_, form. =Pileus= 1½-3
in. across, flesh thin, plano-depressed when young, then
infundibuliform, even, glabrous, hygrophanous, rather slimy and usually
dark brown when moist, becoming pale and opaque when dry, undulate in
large specimens, the margin remains involute for a long time. =Flesh=
watery, similar in color to the pileus, splitting. =Gills= adnate,
becoming decurrent with the depression of the pileus, joined behind,
distant, grayish-brown, sometimes branched. =Stem= spongy and stuffed
inside, elastic, at length often hollow, 2–4 in. long, 3–4 lines thick,
attenuated upward, brownish-fibrillose, fibrils forming an imperfect
reticulation, colored like the pileus or a little paler, apex naked (not
mealy), base villous. _Massee._

On the ground in pastures and woods, rarely on rotten wood.

Usually blackish-umber, but varies to paler grayish-brown, pinky-tan,
pale cinnamon or brownish; then dingy-ochraceous or tan-color. Margin
expanded when old, and also indistinctly striate. _Fries._

Var. _cineras´cens_ Fr. =Pileus= up to 1 in. across, thin,
infundibuliform, pale smoky-brown. =Gills= decurrent, yellowish-white.

hollow.

=Spores= 8×5µ _W.G.S._; 10–12×5–6µ, _B._; 9×6µ _Morgan_.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. Among leaves in woods. September to October. Gregarious.
_McIlvaine._

Fair in quality.


=C. bruma´lis= Fr.—_bruma_, winter. From its late appearance. =Pileus=
about 1 in. across. =Flesh= thin, expanded, umbilicate then
infundibuliform and usually variously waved and lobed, glabrous,
flaccid, hygrophanous, livid, whitish or yellowish when dry, disk often
darker. =Gills= decurrent, about 1 line broad, crowded, pallid. =Stem=
up to 2 in. long and about 2 lines thick, nearly equal, slightly curved,
glabrous, whitish, often compressed, imperfectly hollow. =Spores=
4–5×3–4µ.

In woods, etc.

Truly autumnal, being most abundant in November. There are two forms:
(_a_) on pine leaves in pine woods; (_b_) among heather. (_a_) Stem
rather firm, hollow, about 2 in. long, 2 lines thick, equal or slightly
thickened at the apex, at length compressed, somewhat incurved,
glabrous, naked, becoming livid, white when dry, base white and downy.
Flesh of pileus membranaceous, at first convex, umbilicate, margin
reflexed, about 1 in. across, then funnel-shaped, often irregular and
undulate, up to 2 in. broad, glabrous, even, livid when moist, whitish
then becoming yellowish when dry, disk at first usually darker. Gills
decurrent, at first arcuate, then descending, 1 line broad, crowded,
distinct, livid then yellowish-white, smell weak, not unpleasant. (_b_)
Entirely watery white; stem hollow, somewhat striate, base glabrous;
pileus infundibuliform, margin deflexed, milky-white when dry. Gills
less crowded, but rather broader, whitish. _Fries._

=Spores= 3µ _W.G.S._; 4–5×3–4µ _Massee_.

Edible. _Cooke._


=C. morbi´fera= Pk.—_morbus_, disease; _fero_, to bear. =Pileus= thin,
fragile, glabrous, convex, becoming plane or centrally depressed,
slightly hygrophanous, grayish-brown when moist, whitish or cinereous
when dry, sometimes slightly umbonate. =Gills= narrow, close, adnate or
slightly decurrent, whitish or pallid. =Stem= short, equal, hollow,
colored like the pileus or a little paler. =Spores= minute, broadly
elliptical, 4µ long, almost as broad.

=Pileus= .5–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= about 1 in. long, ⅙–¼ in. thick.
Grassy ground and lawns. November. Washington, D.C. _F.J. Braendle._

The species seems related to C. expallens, but the margin of the pileus
is not striate as in that fungus. The taste is very disagreeable and
remains in the mouth a long time. Two persons were made ill by eating
it, but their sickness lasted only about three hours. _Peck._

I have not seen this species. Its reputation is bad. Caution should be
observed.

                     _Pileus bright, of one color._


=C. trullisa´ta= Ellis. =Pileus= fleshy, plano-convex, at length
depressed in the center, innate fibrous-scaly, becoming smoother on the
disk, margin thin. =Gills= unequal, not crowded, coarse and thick,
adnate with a decurrent tooth, at length white pulverulent,
purple-violet at first, becoming dark brick-red. =Stem= stuffed,
fibrillose, with a long club-shaped base penetrating deeply into the
sand. =Spores= large, cylindric-oblong, 15–20µ.

In old sandy fields. September to October.

The interior of the stem in the young plant is like the gills,
violet-purple, and the club-shaped base is covered with a tomentose
coat, to which the sand adheres tenaciously.

Related to A. laccatus and A. ochropurpureus B.

Resembles the larger forms of A. laccatus, but it has a stouter habit,
the pileus is more squamulose, the stem is bulbous or thickened at the
base, the mycelium is violet-colored and the spores are oblong. Bull.
Torrey Bot. Club, November, 1874.

New Jersey, _Ellis_; New York, _Peck_, Rep. 33.

Haddonfield, Watertown, N.J. Sandy soil in pine woods. _McIlvaine._

Densely cespitose. Caps and stems brown, glutinous and so incrusted with
sand that it is almost impossible to clean them. Edible, but not
desirable.


=C. lacca´ta= Scop.—made of lac. (Plate XXIV, fig. 10, p. 82.) =Pileus=
thin, fleshy, convex, sometimes expanded, even or slightly umbilicate,
smooth or minutely tomentose-scaly, hygrophanous when moist, dull
reddish-yellow or reddish flesh-colored, sometimes striatulate when dry,
pallid or pale dull ochraceous. =Gills= broad, rather thick and distant,
attached, not decurrent, flesh-colored. =Stem= slender, firm, fibrous,
stuffed, equal, concolorous.

=Height= 1–6 in., breadth of pileus 6 lines to 2 in. Common. June to
October.

An extremely variable and abundant species occurring almost everywhere
throughout the season. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 8–9µ _Massee_; 8–10µ _B._

Var. _pallidifo´lia_ Pk.—_pallidus_, pale; _folium_af. Gills whitish or
pallid, decurrent.

Var. _stria´tula_ Pk.—_stria_, a furrow. Pileus moist, smooth, thin,
showing shading radiating lines, extending from near the center to the
margin. In wet or damp places.

A form occurs with a decidedly bulbous base. Gills appearing emarginate
with a decurrent tooth.

Clitocybe laccata is made the type of a new genus by Berkeley and
Broome. Massee accepts the genus but it is not generally accepted by the
standard authors. It is a well defined genus, and a fitting place for C.
laccata, C. amethystina, C. ochropurpurea, C. tortilis, which it puzzles
anyone to identify as Clitocybe.


=C. amethys´tina= Bolt.—_amethystinus_, color of an amethyst. (Plate
XXIV, fig. 8, p. 82.) =Pileus= 1–2½ in. across, dark-purple, umbilicate,
smooth, minutely tomentose, involute. =Gills= dark-purple, decurrent,
broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. high, fibrillose, purple, streaked with white
fibrils, equal, densely covered with white tomentum at base.

Also written _Clitocybe laccata amethystina_ Sacc.

“In my opinion it is a good species and should be kept distinct as
Bolton gave it, and not be tacked on to C. laccata as a variety. I
should write it Clitocybe amethystina Bolt.” _Peck_, letter September
17, 1897.

New York, _Peck_, Rep. 41; New Jersey, _Sterling_; Mt. Gretna, Pa., on
wood soil, June to frost, 1897–1898, _McIlvaine_.

Generally included in C. laccata as a variety, and has therefore been
reported under that name.

Great quantities of C. amethystina grew in troops on beds made up of
wood earth about the cottages at Mt. Gretna, Pa. The woods over them is
dense.

The caps are tough, but they cook readily and make a pleasing dish.


=C. tor´tilis= Bolt.—_tortilis_, twisted. =Pileus= membranaceous,
convexo-plane then depressed, obscurely marked with radiating striæ.
=Stem= hollow, twisted, fragile. =Gills= adnate, thick, distant,
fleshy-rose, cespitose, small, irregular, pileus and stem rusty in
color.

Hard ground in an old road. Sandlake. August. A species closely allied
to C. laccata and appearing like an irregular dwarf form of that
species. Sometimes cespitose. _Peck_, 41st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Excepting that this fungus is frequently found with C. laccata, and
might be taken for a new species if not here described, it would not be
separated from C. laccata.

Its edible qualities are similar.


=C. ochropurpu´rea= Berk.—_ochra_, ocher; _purpureus_, purple. (Plate
XXIV, figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, p. =82=.) =Pileus= subhemispherical, at length
depressed, fleshy, compact, tough, pale yellow, slightly changing to
purplish, cuticle easily separable; margin inflexed, at first tomentose.
=Stem= paler, here and there becoming purplish, solid, swollen in the
middle, occasionally equal. =Gills= thick, purple, broader behind,
decurrent. =Spores= white or pale yellow.

=Pileus= 2 in. broad. =Stem= 2½ in. high, ¾ in. thick in the center.

August. On clayey soil in woodlands.

Its spores darken when shed in quantity, have a granulated and
light-lilac appearance. It is a solitary grower, sometimes reaching the
height of six inches. The upturned, wavy pileus, showing the purple
gills in contrast with the pale Naples-yellow of the cap is markedly
attractive. The stem is often rough with fibers, hard and tough. The
caps are tough. It grows in grassy woods and open places. The novice,
even the expert, will be puzzled to place it in its genus.

Specimens were sent to me by Miss Lydia M. Patchen, Westfield, N.Y., and
E.B. Sterling, Trenton, N.J. I afterward found many at Mt. Gretna, Pa. I
reported their edible qualities to Prof. Peck who wrote, September 3,
1897: “I have often wished it was edible, but it has such a disagreeable
flavor when fresh that I have never ventured to eat it. I have known it
to be mistaken for the common mushroom, but not eaten.”

Though tough it cooks tender and is excellent. Stew and put in patties
or croquettes.

grayish-white when dry. =Gills= grayish, close, thin, attached, not
decurrent. =Stem= slender, equal, smooth, hollow.

=Height= 1–2 in., breadth of pileus 6–18 lines. =Stem= 1–2 lines thick.

Pine woods. West Albany. October.

The plant has the odor and taste of new meal. I have seen no specimens
with the pileus depressed. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=C. meta´chroa= Fr. _Gr._—changing color. Separated from C. ditopa by
its thicker, depressed pileus, its thicker, less close gills, and the
absence of odor.

Pine woods. West Albany. October. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Moderately plentiful in New Jersey pines. September to October.

Edible, tough; when well stewed of good flavor.


                          ** _Gills whitish._


=C. compres´sipes= Pk.—_compressus_, pressed together; _pes_, a foot.
=Pileus= thin, convex or expanded, umbilicate, glabrous, hygrophanous,
brownish when moist, whitish or pale yellow when dry, margin thin.
=Gills= close, subarcuate or horizontal, adnate or subdecurrent,
whitish. =Stem= firm, hollow, generally compressed, slightly pruinose.
=Spores= elliptical, 5–6.5×4–4.5µ. =Flesh= white when dry, odor slight,
farinaceous.

=Plant= gregarious, 1–1.5 in. high. =Pileus= 6–16 lines broad. =Stem=
1–2 lines thick.

Grassy places. Albany. July.

The moist pileus is sometimes obscurely zonate. The odor is not always
perceptible unless the pileus is moist or broken. The stem is sometimes
compressed at the top only, sometimes at the base only, and rarely it is
wholly top-shaped. _Peck_, 33d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found on open lots in West Philadelphia. Though small it usually grows
in troops which yield fair quantity. The caps are tender and of good
flavor.


=C. fra´grans= Sow.—_fragrans_, fragrant. Smell strong, spicy. =Pileus=
about 1 in. across. =Flesh= rather thick; convex, soon expanded and
slightly depressed or umbilicate, even, glabrous, hygrophanous, uniform
watery-white, disk not darker, whitish when dry. =Gills= slightly
decurrent, rather crowded, 1 line broad, distinct, whitish. =Stem= about
2 in. long, equal, slightly curved, elastic, glabrous, whitish, stuffed
then hollow.

In woods among moss, etc.

Distinguished from other species resembling it in color and size, by the
fragrant smell resembling aniseed. _Massee._

=Spores= 6×4µ. _W.G.S._

Found in West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. July to severe frosts.
_McIlvaine._

Edible. The strong taste of anise is not lost in cooking.


=C. pino´phila=—pine loving. =Pileus= thin, convex, umbilicate or
centrally depressed, glabrous, moist, pale tan-color, paler or
alutaceous when dry. =Gills= moderately close, subarcuate, adnate or
slightly decurrent, whitish. =Stem= equal, stuffed or hollow, glabrous
or subpruinose, colored like the pileus. =Spores= nearly elliptical,
4–6µ long; odor and taste resembling that of fresh meal.

                            =COLLY´BIA= Fr.

                          _Gr._—a small coin.


=Pileus= fleshy, usually thin, _margin incurved_ at first, not
corrugated. =Stem= different in substance from the pileus, but confluent
with it; hollow, with a cartilaginous bark, internally cartilaginous or
soft, often rooting. =Gills= free or obtusely adnexed, membranaceous,
soft.

Growing on the ground, wood, leaves and decaying fungi.

In Clitocybe and Tricholoma the substance of the stem and pileus is
alike; they differ in the character of the stem. Tricholoma has no
distinct bark-like coat, and in Clitocybe the stem is covered with
minute fibers. In Mycena as in Collybia the stem is different in
substance from the pileus, but is distinguished by the margin of the
pileus being straight. It is most closely allied to Marasmius, which is
characterized by its tough coriaceous substance, which when dried fully
revives and expands on being moistened. The line between them can not
always be closely drawn, and there are numerous species which it is
difficult to place with certainty in either genus. This does not apply
to the fleshy edible species of this genus as they are quite distinct
from Marasmius.

Peck’s 49th Report contains a monograph of the New York species of
Collybia, supplemented by one of those found in other states.

Several common, prolific, long-season, delicious fungi occur in this
genus. They vary in size from “a small coin” to five inches across. They
grow in woods, on wood, on ground, on leaves, on lawns and among moss
and grass in shaded places. The writer has tested many species raw, and
eaten small quantities cooked, which are not herein described for the
reason that not enough of a species was found to test to full extent. So
far as is reported and as his experience goes, there is not a poisonous
species in Collybia. Many of them are strong in odor.

Var. _pusil´la_ Pk. Plant small. =Pileus= about 1 in. broad, passing
gradually into the typical form. =Stem= slender.

Professor Peck says: “The variety furfuracea is common and connects this
species with C. longipes, which has a villose stem and dry velvety
pileus.” 49th Rep.

Common to the United States. Edible. _Curtis_, according to Dr. F. Peyre
Porcher of Charleston, S.C., was the first to declare this edible.

A very attractive species. The purity of its gills is especially
noticeable. I began eating it in 1881, and it has continued to be a
favorite. The caps should be broiled or fried. They are sweet, pleasing
in texture, and delicately flavored.


=C. platyphyl´la= Fr. _Gr._—broad; a leaf. (Plate XXVIII, fig. 1, p.

stuffed, soft, equal, fibrilloso-striate, otherwise smooth, naked or
obsoletely powdered at the apex, whitish, shortly and bluntly rooted at
the base. =Gills= obliquely cut off behind, _slightly_ adnexed, ½ in.
and more _broad, distant_, soft, white.

Odor not remarkable. It inclines toward the Tricholomata in the
_somewhat membranaceous cuticle of the soft stem_. _Fries._ =Spores=

 (AFTER RAIN),

Distinguished by the very broad and deeply emarginate gills, which
frequently slope up behind to near the cap then with a short turn
downward connect with the stem which is either stuffed or hollow, and by
the abundant, cord-like rooting mycelium. The gills are very broad.
Professor Peck says: “The species is quite variable. The pileus is
sometimes irregular and even eccentric, the thin margin may be slightly
striate, is often split and in wet weather may be upturned or revolute.
The lamellæ are sometimes ½ in. broad or more and transversely split.
They may be obscurely striated transversely and even veiny above with
venose interspaces. Occasionally a slight anise-like odor is
perceptible, but in decay the plants have a very disagreeable odor and
disgusting appearance.” 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, 1880–1885; Haddonfield, N.J., 1896. Gregarious, and in
large bunches. Mt. Gretna and Eagle’s Mere, Pa., 1897, _McIlvaine_.

When fresh, in good condition, the caps are good, but they are not
nearly equal in substance or flavor to C. radicata and C. longipes. They
are best broiled or fried.

Var. _re´pens_ Fr. =Pileus= more fleshy, depressed. =Stem= hollow,
compressed, pruinate at the apex, with a _creeping, string-like
mycelium_.

It is best distinguished by its white, villous, anastomosing, very much
branched mycelium which creeps a long distance in a rooting string-like
manner. The so-called roots are quite different from the stem, not a
prolongation of the stem itself. _Fries._

Clearly a variety of C. platyphylla. C. platyphylla is quite variable,
even puzzling. Edible qualities the same.


=C. long´ipes= Bull.—_longus_, long; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= 1–2 in.
across, conical then expanded, umbonate, dry, minutely, beautifully
velvety. =Color= from pale to date-brown, sometimes umber. =Flesh=
white, thin, elastic. =Gills= white, broad, tough, thick, adnexed,
distant, ventricose, rounded behind, emarginate. =Stem= 4–6 in. long,
2–4 lines thick, tapering upward, usually densely and minutely velvety
like the cap, nearly same color, with a long, tapering root.

On much decayed stumps and logs. July to October. Closely resembles C.
radicata. It is readily distinguished by its velvety cap and stem. It is
more glutinous.

=Spores= spheroid, 12µ _Q._

California. Edible. _H. and M._

West Virginia mountains, 1880–1885; Cheltenham, Pa., 1889. _McIlvaine._

Excepting from California, C. longipes has not previously been reported
as found in the United States. It is not plentiful in the forests of
West Virginia, yet I often found it upon rotting stumps and logs,
solitary, but up to a dozen in the same vicinity. It is unmistakable.
Its rich yet dull velvety cap and stem and the purity of its gills hold
the finder’s admiration.

The caps fried or broiled are delicious, resembling in every way those
of C. radicata.


=C. fu´sipes= Bull.—_fusus_, a spindle; _pes_, a foot. (Plate XXVIII,
fig. 4, p. 112.) =Pileus= 1–3 in. broad, _reddish-brown_, becoming pale
and also dingy-tan, fleshy, convex then flattened, umbonate (the umbo at
length vanishing), even, smooth, dry, here and there broken up in cracks
when dry. =Stem= 3 in. and more long, commonly ½ in., but here and there
as much as 1 in. broad, _fibrous-stuffed then hollow_, remarkably
cartilaginous externally, _swollen, ventricose in the middle, attenuated
at both ends_, often twisted, longitudinally _furrowed_, red or
reddish-brown, _rooted in a spindle-shaped manner at the base_. =Gills=
_annulato-adnexed_ (joined into a ring), soon separating, free, broad,
distant, firm, connected by veins, crisped, white then becoming somewhat
of the same color as the pileus, often spotted. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 6×3µ _W.G.S._; 4–5×2–4µ _B._

Solitary, gregarious, usually densely clustered on decaying wood, roots,
etc. August until after heavy frosts.

West Virginia, 1882, _McIlvaine_.

In the West Virginia mountains C. fusipes is frequent. Caps in the
clusters rarely exceed 1½ in. across. They show an auburn or burgundy
shade of brown in their color. When young they are smooth and appear to
remain so unless rained upon or moistened, when they crack more or less
finely in drying. At first the connection of the gills with the stem is
peculiar—they join in a collar-like ring at the top of the stem. As the
cap expands the gills part more or less and separate from the stem. The
stem is markedly spindle-shaped, though variously flattened by
compression in dense clusters; the outside often splitting, breaking and
turning out from the stem.

The caps, alone, are good, the stem being hard and refractory. The caps
are very fine, cooked in any way.

The caps dry well, and are a pleasant addition to gravies, soups and
other dishes. They make a choice pickle.


                      ** _Gills narrow, crowded._


=C. macula´ta= A. and S.—_macula_, a spot. =Pileus= fleshy, firm, convex
or nearly plane, even, glabrous, white or whitish, sometimes varied with
reddish spots or stains. =Flesh= white. =Gills= narrow, crowded,
adnexed, sometimes nearly or quite free, white or whitish. =Stem=
generally stout, firm, equal or slightly swollen in the middle, striate,
white, stuffed or sometimes hollow, commonly narrowed at the base,
rooting, often curved at the base, rarely slightly thickened and blunt.
=Spores= subglobose, 4–6µ broad, sometimes showing a slight point at one
end.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Var. _immacula´ta_ Cke. This differs from the type in having no reddish
spots or stains.

This species is easily recognized by its large size, firm or compact
substance and white color. It grows in soil filled with decaying
vegetable matter or on much decayed wood. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

West Philadelphia, Pa. Weed grown lot near University of Pennsylvania.
September to frost. Grew gregariously over a large lot. The plants
varied greatly in size and appearance. The gills of most were crenulate
(scalloped). Assorted specimens were sent Professor Peck who wrote:
“They are all forms of C. maculata.”

The caps were stewed and eaten in abundance by many, and pronounced
“Fine.”

[Illustration: COLLYBIA BUTYRACEA.]

=C. butyra´cea= Bull.—_butyrum_, butter; buttery to the touch. =Pileus=
2–3 in. broad, normally _reddish-brown_, but becoming pale, fleshy,
convex then expanded, more or less _umbonate_, dry, _even_, smooth.
=Flesh= buttery, soft, somewhat hygrophanous, flesh-color then white.
=Stem= 2–3 in. long, _attenuated_ upward from the thickened white downy
base, hence much thinner at the apex, 2–3 lines only, but at the base
½-1 in. thick, externally covered over with a _rigid cartilaginous
cuticle_, internally stuffed with soft _spongy pith_, or hollow only
when old, _striate, reddish_, commonly smooth, but varying with white
deciduous scales, and occasionally wholly downy with soft hairs. =Gills=
slightly adnexed, _somewhat free_, thin, _crowded_, notched at the edge,
white, _never spotted-reddish_. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 6–10×3–5µ _B._; elliptical, 7–9×4–5µ.

=Cap= greasy looking. =Umbo= dark.

The color of the cap is variable. The species differs from C. dryophila
in having an umbonate pileus, slightly uneven gill-edges and stem which
tapers upward.

Solitary and in troops under coniferous trees. Spring, autumn.

West Virginia, Chester county and Eagle’s Mere, Pa., _McIlvaine_.

The caps cook quickly, are tender and have a good flavor.

  COLLYBIA VELUTIPES.
  Natural size.
]

=C. velu´tipes= Curt.—_velutum_, velvet; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= 1–4 in.
broad in the same cluster, _tawny_, sometimes paler at the margin,
moderately fleshy at the disk, but thin at the circumference, convex
then soon becoming plane, often eccentric, irregular and bent backward,
smooth, _viscous_; margin spreading and at length slightly striate.
=Flesh= watery, soft, slightly tawny-hyaline. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 1–4
lines thick, tough, externally cartilaginous, _umber then becoming
black, densely, minutely velvety_, commonly ascending or twisted,
commonly equal, even, internally fibrous-stuffed and hollow. =Gills=
broader and rounded behind, slightly adnexed, so as at first sight to
appear free, _somewhat distant_, very unequal, _becoming pallid-yellow
or tawny_. _Fr._

=Spores= ellipsoid, 7µ _W.G.S._; 6×4µ _B._; elliptical, 7×3–3.5µ
_Massee_.

Our American plant, common to the states, is rarely found attaining such
dimensions. Its usual size is from 1–2 in. across, more frequently at
1–1¼. It is generally found in clusters more or less dense. The color
varies from yellowish to a dark yellowish-brown. The center is darker
than the margin. The cap viscid when moist, often irregular from
crowding. Gills may be rounded or notched at their attachment to the
stem, whitish or yellowish. Stem usually hollow, 1–4 in. long, 1–3 lines
thick, whitish when young becoming colored with the dense brownish
velvety hairs.

It grows on stumps, roots in the ground, trunks and earth heavily
charged with wood matter. I have found it in every month of the year.
The heavier crop appears in September, October and November, and lasts
until long after heavy frosts. Then sporadic clusters spring up wherever
the winter sun gives them encouragement.

It sometimes does considerable damage to the tree so unfortunate as to
be its host. It begins its growth upon some injured or decayed spot and
by continually insinuating itself under the surrounding bark it, by its
mycelium and growth, pries the bark away from the wood until the tree is
entirely denuded.

It is a valuable species, not only on account of its continuous growth,
but because of its plentifulness and excellent substance.


                ** _Gills very narrow, closely crowded._


=C. con´fluens= Pers.—=Pileus= ¾-1½ in. broad, thin, tough, flaccid,
convex or nearly plane, obtuse, rarely somewhat umbonate, glabrous,
hygrophanous, reddish grayish-red or reddish-brown and often striatulate
on the margin when moist, pallid, whitish or grayish when dry. =Lamellæ=
narrow, crowded, free, whitish or yellowish-gray. =Stem= 2–5 in. long,
1–2 lines thick, equal, cartilaginous, hollow, clothed with a short
dense somewhat pulverulent whitish pubescence or down. =Spores= minute
ovate or subelliptical, slightly pointed at one end, 5–6×3–4µ.

Among fallen leaves in woods. Common. July to October.

The plants commonly grow in tufts, but sometimes in lines or arcs of
circles or scattered. They revive under the influence of moisture and
thereby indicate an intimate relationship to the genus Marasmius. The
pileus varies much in color, but commonly has a dull reddish or russety
tinge when moist, sometimes approaching bay-red. It fades in drying and
becomes almost white or grayish-white, but sometimes the center remains
more deeply colored than the margin. The stem is commonly rather long in
proportion to the width of the pileus. Occasionally it is somewhat
flattened either at the top or throughout its entire length. Sometimes
the stems become united at the base which union is suggestive of the
specific name. _Peck_, 49th Rep.

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_. July to frost.

The caps of C. confluens are of excellent substance and flavor. Their
quantity makes up for their small size. I have gathered them 2 in.
across, but their average size is about 1 in. They dry well.

=C. esculen´ta= Wulf.—_esculent._ =Pileus= ½ in. and more broad,
_ochraceous-clay_, often becoming dusky, _slightly fleshy_, convex then
plane, orbicular, _obtuse_, smooth, even or when old slightly striate.
=Flesh= tough, white, savory. =Stem= 1 in. and more long, scarcely 1
line thick, or thread-like and wholly equal, _obsoletely tubed_, tough,
_stiff and straight_, even, smooth, slightly shining, _clay-yellow_,
with a _long perpendicular_, commonly _smooth_, tail-like _root_.
=Gills= adnexed, even decurrent with a very thin small tooth, then
separating, _very broad_, limber, _somewhat distant, whitish,_ sometimes
clay-color.

Gregarious but never cespitose. The tube of the stem is very narrow.
_Stevenson._

The smallest edible Collybia. _Cooke._ Edible. In dense woods. _Curtis._
It is dried and preserved. _Cordier._

In pastures and grassy places. Spring and early summer.

Edible, but rather bitter flavor. In Austria, where it is in great
plenty in April, large baskets are brought to market under the name of
Nagelschwämme—nail mushrooms.

Professor Peck describes C. esculentoides Pk., 49th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot., which he states: “Differs from the type in its paler and more
ochraceous color and in its farinaceous flavor, and is related to the
European C. esculenta from which it differs essentially in the
umbilicate pileus and in the absence of any radicating base to the
stem.”

                      ** _Gills narrow, crowded._


=C. dryophil´a= Bull. _Gr._—oak-loving. (Plate XXVIII, fig. 3, p. 112.)
=Pileus= 1–3 in. across, bay-brown-rufous, etc., _becoming pale_, but
not hygrophanous, slightly fleshy, tough, convexo-plane, _obtuse,
commonly depressed in the center_, even, smooth; margin at first
inflexed then flattened. =Flesh= thin, white. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 1–3
lines thick, cartilaginous, _remarkably tubed_, thin, even, smooth,
somewhat rooting, commonly _becoming yellow or reddish_. =Gills=
_somewhat free_, with a small decurrent tooth, but appearing adnexed
when the pileus is depressed, _crowded, narrow_, distinct, plane,
_white_ or becoming pale.

There are numerous monstrous forms which are very deceiving: _a._ =Stem=
elongated, waved, decumbent, inflated at the base; =pileus= broader,
_lobed_; =gills= white. _b._ _Funicularis_, larger, cespitose, the lax
and decumbent =stem= equal and hairy at the base, =gills=
sulphur-yellow. These forms, analagous with A. repens Bull., occur on
heaps of leaves. _c._ Countless specimens growing together in a large
cluster; =stems= thick, inflated, irregularly shaped, _sulcate_, brown,
the mycelium collecting the soil in the form of a ball; =pileus= very
irregularly shaped, full of angles, undulated, blackish then bay-brown.
In gardens. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptic-fusiform, 7–8×4µ; 6µ _W.G.S._

Professor Peck, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot., gives the following: =Pileus=
thin, convex or nearly plane, sometimes with the margin elevated,
irregular, obtuse, glabrous, varying in color, commonly some shade of
bay-red or tan-color. =Flesh= white. =Lamellæ= narrow, crowded, adnexed
or almost free, white or whitish, rarely yellowish. =Stem= equal or
sometimes thickened at the base, cartilaginous, glabrous, hollow,
yellowish or rufescent, commonly similar in color to the pileus.
=Spores=, 6–8×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 1–2 lines thick.

Woods, groves and open places. Common. June to October.

West Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. _McIlvaine._

C. dryophila is so common and variable that descriptions would fail to
cover it in its eccentricities. The writer has eaten it in all the forms
obtained since 1881. A very pretty form grew in large quantities among
pine needles at Eagle’s Mere, Pa., in August, 1897. It was cooked and
served at the hotel table. Many ate it and were delighted.

Dr. Badham refers to a case in which illness was caused by eating it. In
my eighteen years' experience with it, knowing it to have been enjoyably
eaten by scores of persons, I have not heard of the slightest discomfort
from it.


=C. spinulif´era= Pk.—_spinula_, a little thorn. =Pileus= fleshy, thin,
convex or nearly plane, glabrous, hygrophanous reddish tan-color tinged
with pink and slightly striatulate on the margin when moist, paler when
dry, adorned with minute colored spinules or setæ. =Gills= narrow,
close, rounded behind and free, pale cinnamon-color, becoming somewhat
darker with age, spinuliferous. =Stem= slender, tough, glabrous,
shining, hollow, reddish-brown, often paler or whitish at the top,
especially in young plants, with a whitish myceloid tomentum at the
base. =Spores= elliptical or nearly so, 4µ.

=Plant= cespitose. =Pileus= 8–16 lines broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, about
1 line thick.

Prostrate trunks and ground among leaves in woods. Lewis county.
September.

In this species the lamellæ, under a lens, appear to be minutely
pubescent or velvety. This is due to the colored spinules or setæ which
clothe them. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Angora, Pa. September, 1897. Among moss in mixed woods. September to
frost. _McIlvaine._

Specimens identified by Professor Peck. Stems of some tapered at base.

Excepting the extreme base of stems the whole plant is tender and of
good flavor.


(Plate XXXI.)

[Illustration: COLLYBIA ACERVATA (young).]

=C. acerva´ta= Fr.—_acervus_, a heap. =Pileus= fleshy but thin, convex
or nearly plane, obtuse, glabrous, hygrophanous, pale tan-color or dingy
pinkish-red and commonly striatulate on the margin when moist, paler or
whitish when dry. =Gills= narrow, close, adnexed or free, whitish or
tinged with flesh-color. =Stem= slender, rigid, hollow, glabrous,
reddish, reddish-brown or brown, often whitish at the top, especially
when young, commonly with a white matted down at the base. =Spores=
elliptical, 6×3–4µ.

=Plant= cespitose. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, about 1
line thick.

Decaying wood and ground among fallen leaves in woods. Adirondack
mountains. August and September. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

This very pretty plant resembles forms of C. dryophila. The coloring of
the stems is often extremely delicate, like paintings upon rice paper.

West Virginia mountains; Eagle’s Mere, Pa. August to frost. _McIlvaine._

The entire plant is tender, delicate and of fine flavor. In these
qualities it is not distinguishable when cooked from the smaller forms
of C. dryophila.

(Plate XXXII.)

[Illustration: MYCENA GALERICULATA.]

=Pileus= regular, rarely depressed in the center, thin, usually streaked
with longitudinal lines, at first conico-cylindrical, _margin at the
first straight_, closely embracing the stem which is attenuated upward.
=Stem= hollow, slender, cartilaginous. =Gills= adnate or adnexed,
sometimes with a small tooth, never decurrent. =Spores= white.

Generally small and slender, growing on branches, twigs, heaps of
leaves, sometimes on the ground, some minute species on single dead
leaves. Long, rooting stems are not uncommon. Clitocybe and Omphalia are
separated by their decurrent gills and in Collybia the margin is at
first incurved.

In this genus the species of the various sections are not always
distinguished by single sharply defined characteristics, so that it will
sometimes be necessary to pay attention to all the features. Species
with a thread-like stem are found in other sections than Filipedes and
some of the Lactipedes are slippery when moist, but not truly viscous.

Mycena is a large genus composed of small species. About sixty members
have been found in America. They are from ½ to 1 in. across the cap,
with thin stems and altogether delicate appearance. Yet the flesh of
most of them has a gummy consistency in the mouth, and they shrink but
little in stewing. Heretofore not any appear to have been reported as
edible, probably because the size of the species has not attracted
experimenters. While some have a strong odor and taste of radishes, and
one species is bitter, it is probable that all are edible. The writer
has eaten, raw and cooked, small quantities (all he has found) of many
species not here reported as edible, which will, when further tested, be
reported upon.

The substance and flavor of those here given is remarkably pleasant.
Their late coming, hardiness and abundance are commendable qualities.

       I.—CALODON´TES. Stem juiceless. Gills minutely toothed.
                           None tested.

      II.—ADONI´DEÆ. Stem juiceless. Gills of one color, etc.
                           None tested.

     III.—RIGIDI´PEDES. Stem rigid. Gills at first white, changing
                                          color, etc.


=M. prolif´era= Sow.—_proles_, offspring; _fero_, to bear. (Plate X,
figs. 6, 7, p. 28.) =Pileus= ⅔-1¼ in. across, slightly fleshy, expanded
bell-shape, dry, the broad umbo darker (dingy-brown), slightly striate,
and at length furrowed or rimosely split at the margin (pale yellowish
or becoming brownish-tan). =Stem= 2½-3 in. long, firm, rigid, _smooth,
shining, slightly striate_, rooted. Gills adnexed, somewhat distinct,
becoming pale white.

Inodorous, only at length nauseous. Very closely allied to M.
galericulata, in habit approaching nearest to M. cohærens. The stems are
pallid at the apex, but slightly tawny-bay-brown below, and glued
together by hairy down at the base. There is a _white_ form with
transparent stem—on trunks. _Fries._

Mt. Gretna, Pa. On ground in grass. Mycelium spreading on leaves.
_McIlvaine._

Found in great plenty. Base of stems is sometimes white when in dense
tufts.

The whole plant is tender, cooking in fifteen minutes, and is of fine
flavor. No one will want a better fungus.


=M. rugo´sa= Fr.—_ruga_, a wrinkle. =Pileus= ash-color but becoming
pale, very tough, slightly fleshy at the disk, otherwise membranaceous,
bell-shaped then expanded, at length rather plane, somewhat obtuse, more
or less corrugated (unequal with elevated wrinkles), always dry, not
moist even in rainy weather, striate at the circumference. =Stem=
commonly short, remarkably cartilaginous, tubed, rigid, tough, straight,
at length compressed, even, smooth, pallid, with a short oblique hairy
root. =Gills= _arcuato-adnate_, with a decurrent tooth, united behind in
a collar, somewhat distant, connected by veins, broad, ventricose, white
then gray, edge sometimes quite entire, sometimes with saw-like teeth.

Always inodorous. Formerly connected with M. galericulata. M. rugosa is
arid, very tough, more rarely cespitose, the pileus firm, somewhat
obtuse, wrinkled but without striæ, the gills arcuato-adnate with a
hooked tooth, _white then ash-color_. The genuine M. galericulata is
fasciculato-cespitose, somewhat fragile, the pileus thinner, at first
conical and umbonate, striate without wrinkles, the gills adnate, with a
decurrent tooth, white then _flesh-color_. Between these there is a long
series of intermediate forms. _Fries._

September, _Peck_, 46th Rep.; West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.
On decaying wood and ground near stumps. August to November.
_McIlvaine._

The tenacity frequently occurring in Mycena is well shown in this
species. The caps and stem cook tender, but it is better to discard the
stems, as the two do not become tender at the same time.


=M. galericula´ta= Scop.—_galericulum_, a small peaked cap. (Plate Plate
X, fig. 5, p. 28.) =Pileus= somewhat membranaceous, conical bell-shaped
then expanded, striate to the umbo, dry, smooth, becoming brownish-livid
or changeable in color. =Stem= rigid, _polished, even, smooth_, with a
spindle-shaped root at the base. =Gills= _adnate, decurrent with a
tooth_, connected by veins, whitish and flesh-colored.

Very protean. Normally growing in bunches, the numerous stems (never
sticky) glued together with soft hairy down at the base. But it occurs
also solitary, larger, pileus as much as 2 in. broad, wrinkled-striate.
The essential marks by which it is distinguished from A. rugosa are
these: =Stem= in general thinner, less tense and straight, often curved,
more fragile. =Pileus= membranaceous, conico bell-shaped, umbonate,
striate but not corrugated, moist in rainy weather. =Gills= adnate, with
a decurrent tooth, more crowded, _whitish then flesh-colored_. The color
both of the pileus (normally dingy-brownish then livid) and of the stem
(normally becoming livid-brownish) is much more changeable than that of
A. rugosa, becoming yellow, rust colored, etc. It is not so tough and
pliant as A. rugosa. Forms departing from the type are very numerous;
the most beautiful is var. _calopus_ (_Gr._, beautiful; _Gr._, a foot)
with chestnut-colored stems, united in a spindle-shaped tail. _Fries._

=Spores= spheroid or subspheroid, 9–10×6–8µ _K._; 8–11×4–6µ _B._; 6–7×4µ
_Massee._

Common. Autumnal. Very variable. On trunks, fallen leaves.

Two well-marked varieties of this very variable species were observed
the past season. One grows on the ground among fallen leaves. It has a
dark brown pileus, close lamellæ and a very long stem, generally of a
delicate pink color toward the top. It might be called var. _longipes_.
The other grows under pine trees, has a broadly convex or expanded
grayish-brown pileus and a short stem. It might be called var.
_expansus_. _Peck_, 26th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

“_M. alcalina_ is closely allied to it (M. galericulata), but has a
stronger alkaline odor and a rather more fragile stem. In one of your
specimens I detect a slight incarnate tint to the gills, and this is
pretty conclusive evidence that it belongs to M. galericulata. Species
of Mycena are not generally reckoned among edible fungi or even
promising fungi; I suppose on account of the thin flesh of the cap, but
of course it is possible to make up in numbers what is lacking in size.
I am glad to know you have found this to be an esculent one.” Letter
Professor Peck to C. McIlvaine, October 5, 1893.

The caps and stems when young make as good a dish as one cares to eat.
The substance is pleasant, and the flavor delicate. They are best stewed
slowly in their own fluids, after washing, for ten minutes and seasoned
with pepper, salt and butter.


=M. parabo´lica= Fr.—shaped like a parabola. =Pileus= becoming black at
the disk, inclining to violaceous, otherwise becoming pale, whitish,
somewhat membranaceous, at first erect and oval, then parabolic, obtuse,
never expanded, moist, somewhat shining when dry, smooth, even, striate
toward the entire margin. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1 line thick, tubed,
tense and straight but not very rigid, thickened and bearded-rooted at
the base, pale below, dark violaceous above, when young white-mealy,
otherwise even, smooth, dry. =Gills= simply adnate, ascending, somewhat
distant, rarely connected by veins, quite entire, white, somewhat gray
at the base.

=Stem= less rigid than that of A. galericulatus. Truly gregarious or
cespitose. _Fries._

=Spores= 12×6µ _B._; elliptical, 11–12×6µ _Massee_.

Trenton, N.J. June. _E.B. Sterling_; West Virginia, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, on decaying stumps, trunks of oak, chestnut, poplar, pine.
June until far into the winter. _McIlvaine._

=Plant= up to 2½ in. high. =Caps= usually about ½ in., but reaching ¾
in.

A neat, attractive plant, whether single or in dense tufts. Its smell is
strong of fresh meal, and taste of that delicate flavor one finds in the
succulent base of the round, swamp rush, when pulled from its sheath—one
that every country school boy and girl knows. It is pleasant raw, and
delicious when cooked.


=M. latifo´lia= Pk.—_latus_, broad; _folium_, a leaf. =Pileus= convex,
rarely somewhat umbonate, striatulate, grayish-brown. =Gills= white,
broad, hooked, decurrent-toothed. =Stem= slender, smooth, hollow,
subconcolorous, white-villous at the base.

=Height= 1–1.5 in., breadth of pileus 4–6 lines. =Stem= .5 lines thick.

Under pine trees. Center. October.

A small species with quite broad gills, growing among the fallen leaves
of pine trees. Gregarious. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. Among pine needles, scattered, sometimes four or five in
a cluster. September to October. _McIlvaine._

Autumnal. Not rare. The caps though small are tenacious in the mouth and
lose little in cooking. The substance is agreeable and flavor fine.


     IV.— FRAGILI´PEDES. Stem fragile, juiceless, etc. None tested.


                 V.—FILI´PEDES. Stem thread-like, etc.


=M. collaria´ta= Fr.—_collare_, a collar. =Pileus= ½ in. and more broad,
typically dingy-brown, but becoming pale, commonly gray-whitish,
becoming brownish only at the disk, membranaceous, bell-shaped then
_convex_, somewhat umbonate, striate, when dry rigid, smooth, _not soft
nor slightly silky_. =Stem= about 2 in. long, tubed, _thread-like_ but
almost 1 line thick, _tough_, dry, smooth, even or slightly striate
under a lens, becoming pale. =Gills= adnate, _joined in a collar_
behind, thin, crowded, _hoary-whitish or obsoletely flesh-colored_.

The gills are somewhat distant when the pileus is expanded. There is not
a separate collar as in Marasmius rotula; the gills are only joined in
the form of a collar, and remain _cohering_ when they separate from the
stem. _Fries._

Spores 8–10×4–6µ _B._

New York. Old stumps and rotten logs. June. _Peck_, 23d Rep. Mt. Gretna,
Pa. Cespitose on decaying wood. July, September and October.
_McIlvaine._

Very much like M. galericulata, but gills not connected by veins. The
caps usually have a pinkish hue, often brownish. The stems are not as
tender as the caps. The flavor is excellent.


              VI.—LACTI´PEDES. Stem and gills milky, etc.

=M. hæma´topa= Pers. _Gr._—blood; _Gr._—a foot. =Pileus= about 1 in.
broad, white flesh-color, fleshy-membranaceous, _slightly fleshy_
chiefly _at the disk_, conical then bell-shaped, _obtuse_, nay convex
and spuriously umbonate, naked, even or slightly striate at the margin,
which is _at the first elegantly toothed_. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 1 line
and more thick, remarkably tubed, rigid, normally everywhere _powdered
with whitish, delicate, soft hairy down_, sometimes, however, denuded of
it. =Gills= adnate, often with a small decurrent tooth, the alternate
ones shorter, in front disappearing short of the slight margin of the
pileus, whitish and wholly of the same color at the edge.

Cespitose (very many of the stems conjoined and hairy at the base),
firm, stature almost that of M. galericulata, wholly abounding with dark
blood-colored juice.

On stumps. Frequent. September. _Stevenson._

=Spores= spheroid-ellipsoid, 10×6–7µ _K._

I find a non-cespitose form of this species with red-margined gills. Its
red juice, however, will serve to distinguish it and show its true
relations. _Peck_, 31st Rep.

Common in tufts like M. galericulata and of about the same size, but is
readily distinguished by its red juice. This pretty plant can often be
gathered in considerable quantity, and well repays the collector.

=Pileus= symmetrical, very thin, without a distinct pellicle, formed by
the union of the backs of the gills, splitting when expanded. =Gills=
almost or quite free, white. =Stem= central. =Spores= white.

Allied to Lepiota in the thin pileus and free gills, but differing in
the entire absence of a ring. Not at all deliquescent as in the genus
Coprinus, near to which it was at one time placed by Fries. _Massee._

=Pileus= generally _thin_, usually umbilicate at first, then
funnel-shaped, often hygrophanous, margin incurved or straight. =Gills=
_truly decurrent_ from the first, sometimes branched. =Stem= distinctly
cartilaginous, polished, tubular, often stuffed when young. =Flesh=
continuous with that of the pileus but differing in character. =Spores=
white, somewhat elliptical, smooth.

Generally on wood, preferring hilly woods and a damp climate.

Resembling Collybia and Mycena in the flesh of stem and pileus being
different in texture and in the externally cartilaginous stem. It is
perfectly separated by the gills being markedly decurrent from the
first.

The American species of Omphalia number between thirty-five and forty.
Many of them are common. Few woods are free from them. Several of them
are beautiful. They are usually small and lacking in substance. Raw, the
writer has not found one that is objectionable in any way; a few have a
woody taste. But two species have been found by him in sufficient
quantity to make a dish. It is probable that all are edible. At best the
species of Omphalia are valuable in emergency only.

=O. onis´cus= Fr. _Gr._—a wood-louse. From the ashy color. =Pileus=
scarcely 1 in. broad, dark _ashy_ becoming pale, gray-hoary when dry,
somewhat membranaceous, or slightly fleshy, _flaccid_, fragile when old,
_convexo-umbilicate_ or funnel-shaped, often irregular,
undulato-flexuous, even-lobed, _smooth, even_, margin striate. =Stem= 1
in. long, 1 line and more thick, stuffed then tubed, _slightly firm_,
moderately tough, sometimes round, curved, sometimes unequal,
compressed, ascending, undulated, _gray_. Gills shortly _decurrent_,
somewhat distant, quaternate, _ash-color_. Not cespitose. _Fries._

=O. umbellif´era=—_umbella_, a little shade; _fero_, to bear. From its
umbrella-like shape. (Plate XXXIV, p. 132.) =Pileus= about ½ in. broad,
commonly whitish, _slightly fleshy-membranaceous_, convex then plane,
_broadly obconic_ with the decurrent gills, not at all or only slightly
umbilicate, hygrophanous, when moist watery, _rayed with darker striæ_,
when dry even, changeable in appearance, silky, flocculose, rarely
squamulose, _the margin, which is at first inflexed, crenate_
(scalloped). =Stem= _short_, not exceeding 1 in. long, almost 1 line
thick, stuffed then soon tubed, slightly firm, equal or dilated toward
the apex into the pileus, of the same color as the pileus, commonly
_smooth_, but varying pubescent, white villous at the base. =Gills=
_very broad behind, triangular_, decurrent, _very distant_, edge of the
gills straight.

Cosmopolitan. The common form is to be found everywhere from the sea
level to 4,000 feet. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 3×4µ _W.G.S._; 10×4µ _W.P._; green variety 10×6µ _W.P._;
broadly elliptical, 8–10×5–6µ _Peck_.

O. umbellifera is known the world over. It is very variable in size and
color. With us it is seldom over ¾ in. broad. =Stem= ½-1 line thick. It
grows on decaying wood and ground full of decaying material. There are
several varieties. All are edible, but not worth describing. This
description is given that the student may recognize one of our common
plants, and eat it, if very hungry.

                              MYCENA´RII.


=O. campanel´la= Batsch.—_campana_, a bell. =Pileus= thin, rather tough,
hemispherical or convex, glabrous, umbilicate, hygrophanous, rusty
yellow-color and striatulate when moist, paler when dry. =Gills=
moderately close, arcuate, decurrent, yellowish, the interspaces venose.
=Stem= firm, rigid, hollow, _brown_, often paler at the top,
_tawny-strigose at the base_. =Spores= elliptical, 6–7×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 4–8 lines broad. Stem about 1 in. long, scarcely 1 line thick.

Much decayed wood of coniferous trees. Very common. May to November.
_Peck_, 45th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= ellipsoid, 6–8×3–4µ _C.B.P._; 7×3µ _W.P._; 6–9×3–4µ _B._

The quantity alone, in which this small species can be found, makes it
worth mentioning as an edible species. It is common over the United
States where coniferous trees abound. Its favorite habitat is upon the
rotting debris of these trees. Occasionally it grows from the ground,
but only from that which is heavily charged with woody material. It is
social in troops, or affectionate in clusters, or maintains a single
existence.

It is edible, of good substance when stewed, tender and of fair flavor.

                              PLEURO´TUS.

                      _Gr._—a side; _Gr._—an ear.


=Stem= excentric, lateral or none. _Epiphytal_ (_very rarely growing on
the ground_), irregular, fleshy or membranaceous. _Fries._

The excentric, generally lateral stem, absent in some of the species,
separates this from other genera of the white-spored series.

=Pileus= varying from fleshy in the larger to membranaceous in the
smaller forms, but never becoming woody. =Veil= generally wanting, when
present its remains sometimes appear on the margin of the pileus, or as
an evanescent ring on the stem. =Gills=, edge acute, generally
decurrent, in some species with a well-marked tooth, rarely simply
adnate. =Stem= fleshy, confluent and homogeneous with the pileus.

Wood, dead or alive; a few species appear on the ground.

P. ulmarius and others of the larger forms, when growing in an upright
position, may have the stem central and the pileus horizontal. The stems
of some species of Clitocybe and Omphalia if growing laterally are
sometimes excentric and oblique.

This genus is analogous to Claudopus, pink-spored, and Crepidotus,
brown-spored.

=Spores= white, but those of P. sapidus are faintly tinged with lilac,
and of P. ostreatus, var. euosmus, with purple.

If any odium attaches to the word toadstool, it should be forgotten and
forever banished in presence of this cleanly, neat, handsome genus,
choice in its growing places from lichen-covered stumps, or bark-clad
boles, or highly perched limbs, or the scented surfaces of decaying
wood. Several of its species perfume themselves throughout with pleasant
spicy odors. Many are most accommodating in their constant coming.

Mr. H.I. Miller, superintendent Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railroad,
writes: “Most of the mushroom books give greatest space to the A.
campester. For some parts of the country this may be desirable, but for
Indiana and Ohio, considering the food value, the P. ostreatus is the
best fungus we have in these states, from the fact that anybody wanting
a mess can nearly always obtain a basketful of this variety, whereas the
others depend upon a good many weather conditions. Having located a few
logs and stumps in the spring, where the P. ostreatus grows, these same
stumps and logs can be used all season. The crops are successive, and
while some of the spots seem to be barren for a few days at a time, the
others will be bearing. It does not make much difference what the kind
of log or stump, whether it be beech, oak or elm, or what the species of
tree. I think I have found them on all our forest trees, and it is not
necessary for the tree to be dead. If there is a decaying portion, the
spores seem to be carried by the little black beetle that infests the
ostreatus, from one place to another, and wherever a small spot of dead
wood is found we are likely to find the P. ostreatus. This being the
only edible mushroom that we can find in large quantities all through
the season in this neck of the woods, it seems to me that a general
knowledge of it will serve the economic purpose more than any other
fungi.”

The presence of the P. ostreatus and its esculent companions is noted
from our northern boundary to the gulf. Poplar, maple, birch, hickory,
ash, apple, laburnum and oak trees are its favored residences. Deer feed
upon it, and kine are attracted by its scent even when deep under snow.
When properly selected and _slowly_ cooked, the Pleuroti are toothsome.

From the fact that the spores of this fleshy and valuable genus find
fostering lodgment in many trees when in decay, it is more than probable
that the several species can be propagated by planting their spores upon
such decaying woods, or by transplanting the mycelium.

Growths of P. ostreatus, P. sapidus, P. salignus, and probably other
species of Pleurotus, can be forced, by watering the spots upon which
they are known to grow. Dr. Kalchbrenner mentions that the P. sapidus is
in this way cultivated in Hungary. Acting upon this mention the writer
had good success with P. ostreatus. Experiments in this direction are
likely to be interesting and rewarding.

No species is suspected of being noxious.

An analysis of P. ostreatus is given by Lafayette B. Mendel, Sheffield
Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Yale University, as follows:

                        *_Veil fugacious, etc._


=P. dry´inus= Pers. _Gr._—oak. =Pileus= 2 in. broad, whitish, variegated
with spot-like scales which become dingy-brown, lateral, oblique, rather
plane. =Flesh= thick. =Stem= very curt and obese, commonly 1 in. long
and thick, somewhat lateral, somewhat woody, squamulose, white, with a
short, blunt root. =Veil= scarcely conspicuous on the stem, but
appendiculate round the margin of the pileus when young. =Gills= not
very decurrent, somewhat simple, not anastomosing behind, narrow, white,
becoming yellow when old.

On trunks, oak, ash, willow, etc. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 10×4µ _Massee_.

Edible. _Cordier_, _Cooke_.

When young the caps are tender; of the consistency, when cooked, of
Polyporus sulphureus. In taste and smell the species varies from other
Pleuroti, in having a distinct musk-like flavor. This is agreeable,
reminding one of the common mushroom—A. campester.


                   **_Veil none, gills sinuate, etc._


=P. ulma´rius= Bull.—_ulmus_, an elm. =Pileus= 3–5 in. and more broad,
_becoming pale-livid_, often marbled with round spots, fleshy,
_compact_, horizontal, moderately regular although more or less
excentric, convex then plane, disk-shaped, even, smooth. =Flesh= white,
tough. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1 in. thick, solid, firm, _elastic_,
somewhat excentric, curved-ascending, _thickened_ and tomentose _at the
base_, not rarely villous throughout, white. =Gills= horizontal,
_emarginate_ or rounded _behind_, slightly adnexed, broad (broader in
the middle), somewhat crowded, whitish.

The pileus is sometimes cracked in a tessellated manner. _Stevenson._

The gills are sometimes torn across like those of Lentinus.

The historic elms of Boston Common have borne copious crops of this
well-known and easily distinguished species from time immemorial. Every
fall, about the first of September, if the season is favorable, later if
not, copious crops appear decorating the trunks, and branches, sometimes
at a height of thirty or forty feet. Growth takes place where branches
have broken off or the trees have been wounded from other causes. They
occur very generally on elms in the outlying districts of the city, but
are rare in the country, seeming to be distinctly urban in their tastes.
No damage is apparent from their growth.

Immediately in the rear of Independence Hall, Philadelphia, a fine
cluster appears with equal autumnal regularity.

Though the elm tree is the chosen habitat of this fungus, it is little
less select in its choice than other members of its genus.

When young and small P. ulmarius is tender and of acceptable flavor. The
stems and centers of older specimens should be cut away, and the tender
parts of the caps, only, used.


=P. tessula´tus= Bull.—_tessela_, a small cube for pavement. =Pileus=
_becoming pale-tawny_, horizontal, compactly fleshy, convex then plane,
and in a form which is somewhat lateral depressed behind, irregular,
even, smooth, _variegated_ with round and hexagonal paler _spots_.
=Flesh= thick, white. =Stem= short, 1 in. or little more long, solid,
_compact_, _equal_ or attenuated at the base, very excentric,
curved-ascending, even, _smooth_, white. =Gills= _sinuate behind_,
uncinato-adnate, thin, _crowded_, white or becoming yellow.

Solitary; according to some cespitose. The pileus is not cracked in a
tessellated manner, as one might easily imagine from the name, but
variegated with spots. Smaller than A. ulmarius (to which it is too
closely allied), but almost more compact, with a smell of new meal.

On trunks. _Stevenson._

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_. Edible. _Curtis._ Edible. _Cordier._

On specimens growing cespitose and singly, found at Haddonfield, N.J.
September, 1895, on trunk of apple tree, and at Eagle’s Mere, Pa.,
singly on sugar maple, August, 1898, the margin of caps were beautifully
marked, but not cracked.

In quality it is better than P. ulmarius.


=P. subpalma´tus= Fr.—_sub_ and _palma_, a palm. =Pileus= 3–5 in.
across. =Flesh= thick, soft, variegated; convex then more or less
flattened, irregularly circular, obtuse, wrinkled, smooth, with a
gelatinous cuticle, rufescent. =Stem= excentric or almost lateral, but
the pileus is always marginate behind, fibrillose, short, equal, flesh
fibrous, soft. =Gills= adnate, 3–4 lines broad, crowded, joined behind,
dingy. _Massee._

On old trunks, squared timber, etc.

Very remarkable for having the flesh variegated as in Fistulina
hepatica. Pileus, especially when young, covered with a viscid pellicle.
_Fr._

=Spores= minutely echinulate, nearly globose, 5.6×7µ _Morgan_.

Ohio, _Morgan_; Wisconsin, _Bundy_.

I frequently found this species in North Carolina, growing from oak ties
and standing oak timber. I did not notice distillation of rufescent
drops from the cap. The soft flesh had good flavor. The gelatinous
cuticle imparts its character to the dish. Mixed with Lentinus lepideus,
a much tougher plant, which grows in great abundance in the same
localities, it makes toothsome food.


=P. lignati´lis= Fr.—_lignum_, wood. Dingy whitish. =Pileus= 1–4 in.
broad, rarely central, commonly more or less excentric, occasionally
wholly lateral, often kidney-shaped, fleshy, thin, but compact and
tough, fissile, convex then plane, obtuse and often umbilicate,
_flocculoso-pruinate_, at length denuded with rain, repand, margin at
first involute then expanded, undulato-lobed when luxuriant. =Stem=
sometimes 2–3 in., sometimes 3–4 lines long (even obliterated), _stuffed
then hollow_, always _thin_, unequal, curved, curved or flexuous, tough
and flexile, whitish, everywhere pruinato-villous, rooting and somewhat
tomentose at the base. =Gills= _adnate_, very _crowded_ and narrow,
unequal, divergent in the lobes, shining white. _Fries._

Exceedingly variable, wholly inconstant in form; substance thin and
pliant; commonly densely cespitose, but also single. Odor strong of new
meal.

On wood, beech, etc. _Stevenson._

Parasitic on a rotten plant of Polyporus annosus on elm. _W.G.S._

White and grayish-white, margin faintly striate; white-spotted, odor
distinctly farinaceous. _C.M._

Kingsessing, near Philadelphia; Mt. Gretna, Pa. _McIlvaine._

This is a good species in every way. I have not found it in extended
quantity, but it is probable that it will be found in plenty when closer
observed and better known.


=P. circina´tus= Fr.—to make round. _Wholly white_, not hygrophanous.
=Pileus= about 3 in. broad, _orbicular_, horizontal, fleshy, tough,
convex then plano-disk-shaped, obtuse, even, but _covered over with a
shining whitish slightly silky luster_. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 3–4 lines
thick, _stuffed_, _elastic_, equal, _central_ or slightly excentric,
commonly _straight_, _smooth_, bluntly rooted at the base. =Gills=
adnate, slightly decurrent, crowded, broad (as much as 3 lines), white.
_Fries._

An exceedingly distinct species. Regular, solitary, with a weak,
pleasant, not mealy odor. The pileus is a little thicker than that of A.
lignatilis, but less compact; the gills are twice as broad. As A.
lignatilis is changeable, this is always constant in form.

On rotting birch stump. _Stevenson._

California, _H. and M._

Found at Eagle’s Mere, Pa., August, 1898, on birch trees. Generally
solitary; sometimes six or eight on one tree, beautifully shining white,
at a distance resembling young Polyporus betulinus. Large quantities of
it grow in the extensive birch forests at Eagle’s Mere, yielding a ready
food supply. Its flavor is pleasant, and texture, when cooked, quite
tender.


=P. pubes´cens= Pk.—_pubes_, down or soft hair. =Pileus= fleshy, convex,
suborbicular, pubescent, yellowish. =Gills= broad, subdistant, rounded
behind, sinuate, pallid tinged with red. =Stem= short, firm, curved,
eccentric, colored like the pileus. =Spores= globose, 8µ broad.

=P. sa´pidus= Kalchb.—savory. Cespitose, or several pilei appearing to
spring from a common branched stem. =Pileus= 1–3 in. across. =Flesh=
thick, excentric, regular, convex or obtusely gibbous then depressed,
glabrous, white or brownish. =Stem= stout, solid, several usually
springing from a thickened knob, whitish, 1–2 in. long, expanding upward
into the pileus. =Gills= decurrent, rather distant, narrow, whitish.
=Spores= elliptical, 10–11×4–5µ.

On elm trunks.

A very variable species; according to Kalchbrenner, the spores have a
faint tinge of lilac, and the pileus is white, tawny, brownish, or umber
on the same trunk. The white form only has been met with in this
country. _Massee._

=Spores= with a lilac tinge, oblong or a little curved and pointed,
8.3×3.7µ _Morgan_; oblong, 9–11.5×4–5µ _Peck_; 10–11×4–5µ _Massee_.

Not observed in England until 1887.

Quite common throughout the United States, growing upon decaying wood,
whether above or under ground. It has few distinct features. The only
positive one distinguishing it from P. ostreatus is its lilac-tinted
spores. The tint is faint but noticeable upon white background.
Excepting for purposes of the student, its separation, as a species,
from P. ostreatus is not necessary. When old it has more body than the
latter, but is equally superior as a food fungus.

Professor Peck remarks of it: “A stew made of it is a very good
substitute for an oyster stew.”

It can be cultivated by watering the places upon which it is known to
appear.


=P. pome´ti= Fr.—_pometum_, an orchard. =Pileus= white, fleshy, soft,
sub-flaccid, irregular, involute, convex, even, smooth, disk depressed.
=Gills= decurrent, crowded, separate behind. =Stem= 2–3 in. high, 3–4
lines thick, excentric, solid, tough, ascending, rooting.

becoming pale_, brownish-ash color, passing into yellow when old,
fleshy, _soft, shell-shaped_, somewhat dimidiate, _ascending_, smooth,
moist, even, but sometimes with the cuticle torn into squamules. =Stem=
shortened or obliterated, firm, elastic, ascending obliquely,
_thickening upward_, white, strigoso-villous at the base. =Gills=
_decurrent, anastomosing behind, somewhat distant_, broad, white,
sometimes turning light yellow, _and without glandules_.

For the most part cespitose, imbricated, very variable, sometimes almost
central. The pileus is at first convex and horizontal, then expanded and
ascending. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 10–12×4–5µ _Massee_; 7.5–10×4µ _Peck_.

small wart-like or glandular bodies.

On trunks. A very constant but somewhat rare variety; easily known by
the dark-brown pileus. The gland-like bodies on the gills are due to the
outward growth of the hyphæ of the trama in minute patches here and
there. _Massee._

Var. _euos´mus_ Berk.—strong-smelling. Strong scented, imbricate. Pileus
fleshy, depressed, shining, silky when dry, at first white with a tinge
of blue, then brownish. Stem short or obsolete. Gills decurrent,
ventricose, dingy, white. =Spores= 12–14×5µ, pale pinkish-lilac.

On elm trunks. Pilei very much crowded, 2 in. or more across, deeply
depressed, unequal, at first white, invested with a slight blue varnish,
at length of a pale brown. Stems distinct above, connate below. Gills
rather broad; running down to the bottom of the free portion of the
stem. Spores oblong, narrow, oblique, white, tinged with purple. The
whole plant smells, when first gathered, strongly of tarragon. _B. and
Br._

Found at Richmond, Ind., _Dr. J.R. Weist_. On hickory stump at Mt.
Gretna, Pa., _McIlvaine_; Haddonfield, N.J., _T.J. Collins_.

This esculent fungus closely allied to P. ostreatus, and differing only
in having lilac spores, has been followed from book to book by a bad
reputation, probably because of its “rosy” or lilac spores—all fungi
having pink spores having been, until recently, ignorantly branded by
authors as poisonous. The writer has eaten meals of it many times, as
have his friends. It is in every way equal to P. ostreatus.

The rare qualities of this species are stated in the descriptive heading
of the genus. Its very name implies excellence. The camel is gratefully
called the ship of the desert; the oyster mushroom is the shellfish of
the forest. When the tender parts are dipped in egg, rolled in bread
crumbs, and fried as an oyster they are not excelled by any vegetable,
and are worthy of place in the daintiest menu.


=P. salig´nus= Schwam.—_salix_, willow. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, sooty
ash-color or ochraceous, fleshy, compact, _spongy_, somewhat dimidiate,
_horizontal_, at first pulvinate, even, at length depressed behind and
here and there strigose, the incurved margin entire. =Stem= always
short, firm, more or less tomentose. =Gills= horizontal, hence less
manifestly decurrent, separate behind, but _branched in the middle_,
crowded, dingy, often eroded at the edge, not glandular.

Among the larger and firmer species. Solitary, scarcely ever cespitose.
It is commonly confounded with A. ostreatus, but is certainly a
different species. Although the stature is in general the same, it is
easily distinguished by the pileus being more compact, and more
pulverulent when young, then depressed, by the gills being thinner, more
crowded, somewhat branched, but not anastomosing behind, and dingy
soot-color; the spores also are dingy. _Stevenson._

=Spores= oblong or cylindrical-oblong, 8×4µ _W.G.S._; 8–10×3–4µ _B._

Dr. Curtis wrote of this: “Indeed I have found several persons who class
this among the most palatable species. To such persons a dish of fresh
mushrooms need seldom be wanting, as this one can be had every month of
the year in this latitude.”

In New Jersey, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, Pa., I have found P.
salignus in quantity. It has been sent to me by Dr. J.R. Weist, of
Richmond, Ind., who writes, “I have eaten it with great enjoyment.”

In 1881 I found it frequently on water beeches and willows, and
thoroughly tested its edible qualities. _R.K. Macadam_, Boston.

When young or fresh, it is quite equal to any Pleurotus. When old, as
with others of the Pleuroti, it is tough. Nevertheless their margins are
always edible unless decaying.


                            II.—DIMIDIA´TI.


=P. petaloi´des= Bull.—petal of a flower. =Pileus= 1–2 in. long,
_dingy-brown_, becoming pale, dimidiate, fleshy, but in no wise compact,
rather plane, _somewhat spathulate_, continuous with the stem and
_depressed behind_, hence the villous down of the stem ascends to this
point (the disk) of the pileus, otherwise smooth, even, margin at first
involute then expanded. =Stem= about ½ in. long, sometimes however very
short, solid, firm, _compressed, channeled_ when larger, more or less
villous, whitish. =Gills= _decurrent, very crowded_, very narrow
(scarcely beyond 2 mm. broad), linear, very unequal, white then
ash-color.

Taste bitter. The form on wood is somewhat horizontal, gregarious here
and there imbricated. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 9–10×4µ _Massee_; 8×4µ _W.G.S._; minutely globose, 3–4µ _Peck_.

Edible. _Cooke_, _Cordier_.


=P. spathula´tus= Pers.—shaped like a spathula. =Pileus= rather thin,
1–2 in. broad, ascending, spathulate, tapering behind into the stem,
glabrous, convex or depressed on the disk and there sometimes pubescent,
alutaceous or brownish tinged with gray, red or yellow. =Gills= crowded,
linear, decurrent, whitish or yellowish. =Stem= compressed, sometimes
channeled above, grayish-tomentose. =Spores= elliptical, 7.6×4–5µ broad;
odor and taste farinaceous.

Ground. Sandlake. June. Edible.

It grows singly or in tufts and is an inch or more in height. The margin
is thin and sometimes striatulate and reflexed. Toward the base the
flesh is thicker than the breadth of the gills. The cuticle is tough and
separable. The flesh is said by Gillet to be tender and delicate.
Persoon describes the disk as spongy-squamulose, but in our specimens it
is merely pubescent or tomentose. _Peck_, 39th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Recorded as edible by Professor Peck. At Eagle’s Mere, Pa., I found many
specimens agreeing with this description. They grew from decaying wood
under ground, yet had the appearance of growing from the earth. It is
probable that others have been deceived. In quality I found this to be
one of the best.


=P. sero´tinus= Fr.—late. =Pileus= fleshy, 1–3 in. broad, compact,
convex or nearly plane, viscid when young and moist, dimidiate
kidney-shaped or suborbicular, solitary or cespitose and imbricated,
variously colored, dingy-yellow, reddish-brown, greenish-brown or
olivaceous, the margin at first involute. =Gills= close, determinate,
whitish or yellowish. =Stem= very short, lateral, thick, yellowish
beneath and minutely tomentose or squamulose with blackish points.
=Spores= minute, elliptical, 5µ long, 2.5µ broad.

Dead trunks of deciduous trees. _Peck_, 39th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1887, and at Mt. Moriah, near Philadelphia, from August
until November, 1898. Upon these findings the pileus was tomentose at
base, as was the short stem.

The species is not noticeably viscid after its youth. The viscidity can
be detected in old specimens by moistening the pileus. Its flavor is not
marked, nor is its texture as pleasing as most others of its genus, but
being a late species it satisfies the longing of the mycophagist for his
accustomed food.


=P. pulmona´rius= Fr.—_pulmo_, lung, from texture. =Pileus= 2–3 in.
broad, _ash-colored_, continuous with the stem, fleshy, soft, but tough,
_flaccid_, _obovate_ or kidney-shaped, plane or reflexo-conchate at the
margin, even, _smooth_. =Flesh= thin, soft, white. =Stem= very short,
solid, exactly lateral, _horizontal_ or ascending, _round_, _villous_,
expanded into the pileus. =Gills= decurrent but _ending determinately_,
_moderately broad_, distinct, not branched or anastomosing at the base,
livid or _ash-color_.

The primary form is solitary. The pileus is ashy-tan when dried. It
differs from A. salignus alike in the definitely lateral stem and in the
thin flaccid pileus. _Fries._

Not previously reported.

Found by Miss Madeleine Le Moyne, Washington, Pa., September, 1898, and
sent to writer. Gills 3 lines broad, not narrow in proportion to flesh.

Taste and smell similar to P. ostreatus. Cooked it is tender, and more
succulent than P. ostreatus.


                           III.—RESUPINA´TI.


=P. mastruca´tus= Fr.—_mastruca_, a sheepskin. =Pileus= up to 2 in. long
and 1 in. broad, sessile, at first resupinate then expanded and
horizontal, often lobed, upper stratum of pileus gelatinous, brown,
bristling with squarrose or erect squamules. =Flesh= thickish. =Gills=
radiating from the point of attachment, broad, rather distant,
grayish-white.

On old trunks. Imbricated. Readily distinguished by the brown,
squarrosely scaly pileus. _Massee._

=Spores= oblong, oblique, 8×5µ _Morgan_.

In June, 1886, the writer found this species in oak woods near
Philadelphia. It grew on fallen trunks and on decaying spots of living
timber.

It is edible, and of good flavor, but is rough in the mouth. If found in
quantity, the extract of it would make a delicate soup.

(Plate XXXVIII.)

[Illustration: HYGROPHORUS PRATENSIS.]

=Pileus= regular or undulated and wavy, often viscid or moist. =Flesh=
of the pileus continuous with that of the stem and descending as a trama
into the gills. =Gills= adnate or adnexed, more or less decurrent,
_waxy_, often thick and forked, _edge always thin and sharp_, often
branched.

On the ground. Many species are brightly colored. =Spores= white.

This genus differs from the preceding genera in the manifest trama, the
substance of which is similar to that of the pileus; from Lactarius and
Russula by the trama not being vesicular, but somewhat floccose with
granules intermixed; from Cantharellus, its nearest ally, by the sharp
edge of the gills. The Cortinarii, Paxilli and Gomphidii are at once
distinguished from it by their colored spores and the changing color of
their gills, as well as by other marks. From all the other genera of
Agaricini it is distinguished by a mark peculiar to itself, viz., by the
hymeneal stratum of the gills changing into a waxy mass, which is at
length removable from the trama. This altogether singular character is
specially remarkable in H. caprinus, coccineus, murinaceus, etc. Hence
the gills seem full of watery juice, but they do not become milky like
those of the Lactarii. _Fries._

From the description by Fries, the author of the genus, it is manifest
that one has to wait the ripening of the fungus before the peculiar
characteristic mark of the genus, _i. e._—gills turning into a waxy
mass, easily removable from the cap—can be observed. Many of the species
are difficult to determine when fresh. Nevertheless, there is an
indescribable, watery, waxy, translucent appearance about the gills
which catches the eye of the expert, and is soon learned by the novice.
The white spores readily separate the genus from kindred shapes in the
colored-spored genera.

So far as tested none of the species is poisonous. One English species
is fetid. It is probable that they are all edible, varying in quality
only. Fries well, and is superior in croquettes and patties.

                     * _White or yellowish-white._

=H. chry´sodon= Fr. _Gr_—gold; a tooth. From tooth-like squamules.
=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, _white_, shining when dry, but commonly
yellowish with minute adpressed squamules at the disk, light
yellow-_flocculose at the involute margin_, fleshy, convex then plane,
obtuse, viscid. =Flesh= white, sometimes reddish. =Stem= 2–3 in. long,
about ½ in. thick, stuffed, soft, somewhat equal (sometimes, however,
irregularly shaped or thickened at the base), white, with minute _light
yellow squamules_, which are more crowded and arranged in the form of a
ring _toward the apex_. =Gills= decurrent, distant, 3 lines broad, thin,
white, somewhat yellowish at the edge, sometimes crisped.

Odor not unpleasant. There is a manifest _veil_, not woven into a
continuous ring, but _collected in the form of floccose squamules at the
apex of the stem and the margin of the pileus_. Var. leucodon with white
squamules. _Fries._

In woods.

The lamellæ are said to be crisped, and when young, to have the edge
yellow-floccose; but I have seen no such specimens. _Peck_, 23d Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 8×4µ _Cooke_.

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. _McIlvaine._

A pleasant, excellent species, whose rarity is regrettable.


=H. ebur´neus= Bull. Fr.—_ebur_, ivory. Wholly _shining white_. =Pileus=
fleshy, sometimes thin, sometimes somewhat compact, convexo-plane,
somewhat repand, even, _very glutinous_ in rainy weather, _margin soon
naked_. =Stem= sometimes short, sometimes elongated, stuffed then
hollow, unequal, _glutinous_ like the pileus, _rough at the apex with
dots in the form of squamules_. =Gills= decurrent, distant, veined at
the base, 3–4 lines broad, tense and straight, quite entire. _Fries._

Odor mild, not unpleasant. Very changeable. The veil is absent, unless
the _very plentiful gluten_ which envelops the stem be regarded as a
universal veil; _margin of the young pileus_ involute, only at the first
_pubescent_, _soon naked_. The stem is soft internally, at length
hollow, attenuated toward the base.

In woods and pastures. Frequent. September to October. _Stevenson._

The whole plant is pure white when fresh, but in drying the gills assume
a cinnamon-brown hue. _Peck_, Rep. 26.

=Spores= 6×5µ _Cooke_; 4×5µ _W.G.S._; 5–6µ _K._; 6×4µ _C.B.P._

A common and wide-spread species frequenting woods and pastures.

Edible. _Curtis._

The author ate it in West Virginia, in 1882; at Devon, Pa., 1887;
Haddonfield, N.J., 1890. It is well flavored but in texture is not of
first quality.


=H. pena´rius= Fr.—_penus_, food. =Pileus= _tan-color, opaque_, fleshy,
especially when young, at first umbonate, then very obtuse,
hemispherical then flattened, even, smooth, _commonly dry_, margin at
first involute, exceeding the gills, undulated when flattened. =Flesh=
thick, hard, whitish, unchangeable. =Stem= curt, 1½ in. or more long,
about ½ in. thick at the apex, _solid, compact_, hard, _attenuated at
the base into a spindle-shaped root_, ventricose to the neck, again
attenuated upward or wholly fusiform-attenuated, pale-white, smeared
with tenacious, easily dried slime, _warty_. =Flesh= firm, but
_externally more rigid_, cuticle somewhat fragile. =Veil= not
conspicuous. =Gills= adnato-decurrent, acute behind, _distant, thick_,
3–4 lines broad, veined, tan inclining to pale. _Fries._

Odor pleasant, taste sweet. The fusiform root is as long as the stem.

In mixed woods. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 7–8×4–5µ.

Edible. _Cooke_.

Large specimens occurred in mixed woods, in November, 1898, at Mt.
Gretna. The caps varied from 1½-5 in. across. The color was white,
tinged with yellow, much lighter than described. The caps look coarse
and the stems are not inviting; but the caps have a pleasant odor. When
stewed for twenty minutes they are meaty and tasty.

                             ** _Reddish._


=H. erubes´cens= Fr.—_erubesco_, to become red. =Pileus= 2–4 in. and
more broad, white becoming everywhere red, fleshy, gibbous then
convexo-plane, viscid, _adpressedly dotted with squamules or becoming
smooth_, sometimes wholly compact, sometimes thin towards the _margin
which is at the first naked_. =Flesh= firm, white. =Stem= sometimes
short, robust, 2 in. long, 1 in. thick and attenuated upward, sometimes
elongated, 4 in. long, equal or attenuated at the base, _solid_,
flexuous, _with red fibrils, dotted with red upward_. =Gills= decurrent,
distant, _soft, white, with red spots_. _Fries._

Veil none. The ground color is white, as it is also internally, but it
everywhere becomes red and the pileus often rosy blood-color. Handsome,
growing in troops, commonly forming large lax circles.

In pine woods. _Stevenson._

=Spores= ellipsoid, very obtuse at both ends, 8–10×4–5µ _K_.; 8×4µ
_Cooke_.

Edible. _Cooke._

                         *** _Tawny or yellow._


=H. ni´tidus= B. and Rav.—_shining_. =Pileus= thin, fleshy, convex,
broadly umbilicate, smooth, shining, viscid, pale yellow with the margin
striatulate when moist, nearly white when dry. =Gills= arcuate,
decurrent, yellow. =Stem= slender, brittle, smooth, viscid, hollow,
yellow. =Flesh= yellow.

=Height= 2–4 in., breadth of =Pileus= 8–12 lines. =Stem= 1–2 lines
thick.

Swamps. Sandlake. August.

The cavity of the stem is very small. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found in many states and places, usually on moist ground beside streams,
or spring heads. It sometimes parades itself in irregular processions,
at others in sparse patches. It is delicate in flavor, and tender
cooked.


                        **** _Olivaceous-umber._


=H. limaci´nus= Fr.—_limax_, a slug. =Pileus= 1½-2½ in. broad, _disk
umber then sooty_, paler round the margin, fleshy, convex then
flattened, obtuse, smooth, viscid. =Flesh= rather firm, white. =Stem=
2–3 in. long, ½ in. thick, _solid_, firm, ventricose, _sticky_,
flocculose, fibrilloso-striate, _roughened with squamules at the apex_.
=Gills= adnate, then decurrent, somewhat distant, thin, _white inclining
to ash-color_. _Fries._

Veil entirely viscous, not floccose.

In woods among damp leaves. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 12×4µ _Cooke_.

New York, _Peck_, Rep. 34. Thin woods and open places.

Reported edible Bulletin No. 5, 1897, Boston Mycological Club.


=H. hypoth´ejus= Fr. _Gr._—under; _Gr_—sulphur (under gluten). =Pileus=
1–2 in. broad, _at first smeared with olivaceous gluten_, ash-colored,
when the gluten disappears, becoming pale and yellowish, orange or
rarely (when rotting) rufescent, fleshy, _thin_, convex then depressed,
_obtuse_, even, somewhat streaked. =Flesh= thin, white then becoming
light yellow. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 2–3 lines and more thick, _stuffed_,
equal, _even, viscous_, but rarely spotted with the veil, at length
hollow. Partial _veil_ floccose, at the first _cortinate and annular,
soon fugacious_. =Gills= decurrent, _distant_, distinct, at first pallid
(even whitish) soon _yellow_, sometimes flesh-color. _Fries._

Very protean, changeable in color and variable in size. Stem not
scabrous. There is no trace of the veil when the plant is full grown.
Appearing after the first cold autumn nights, and lasting even till
snow.

In pine woods. Frequent. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 10×6µ _Cooke_; 12×4µ _W.G.S._

Hollis Webster, in Bulletin No. 5, 1897, Boston Mycological Club,
writes: “H. hypothejus Fr., when dried, is crisp and nutty, and very
good to carry in the pocket for occasional nibble.”


II.—CAMAROPHYL´LUS.

                    * _Gills deeply decurrent, etc._


=H. praten´sis= Fr.—_pratum_, a meadow. (Plate XXXVII, figs. 1, 2, 3, p.
146. Plate XXXVIII, p. 147.) =Pileus= 1–2 in. and more broad, somewhat
pale yellowish, _compactly fleshy especially at the disk, thin toward
the margin_, convex then flattened, _almost top-shaped_ from the stem
being thickened upward, even, smooth, moist (but not viscous) in rainy
weather, when dry often rimosely incised, here and there split regularly
round. =Flesh= firm, white. =Stem= 1½-2 in. long, ½ in. and more thick,
_stuffed_, internally spongy, externally polished-evened and firmer,
_attenuated downward_, even, smooth, naked. =Gills= _remarkably
decurrent_, at _first arcuate, then extended in the form of an inverted
cone_, very distant, thick, firm, brittle, connected by veins at the
base, very broad in the middle, of the same color as the pileus.
_Fries._

Very protean. Veil none. The flesh of the pileus is formed as it were of
the stem dilated upward. The typical form resembles the Cantharelli.
_Everywhere becoming light yellow-tawny_, but varying with the stem and
gills pale-white.

In pastures. Common. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 6×4µ _Cooke_; 6–10×4–6µ _K._

Common over the United States. West Virginia, 1881, North Carolina,
1890, Pennsylvania, 1887, Mt. Gretna, 1897–1898. _McIlvaine._

Gregarious, and often in tufts, sometimes in partial rings.

An exceedingly variable species. White, buff, smoky, pinkish colors are
common. The cap shapes are also diverse. The margins of some are
incurved; of others repand. The weather seems to have much to do with
their shapes.

M.C. Cooke says: “It requires careful cooking, as it is liable to be
condemned as tough, unless treated slowly, but it is a great favorite
abroad.” He calls them “Buff Caps.”

All fungi are the better for slow cooking. The H. pratensis in all its
forms is excellent, but particularly so in croquettes and patés.


=H. virgin´eus= Fr.—_virgo_, a virgin. (Plate XXXVII, fig. 6, p. 146.)
_Wholly white._ =Pileus= fleshy, convex then plane, _obtuse_, moist, _at
length depressed_, cracked into patches, floccose when dry. =Stem=
_curt, stuffed, firm_, attenuated at the base, externally becoming even
and naked. =Gills= decurrent, distant, rather thick. _Fries._

=Flesh= sometimes equal, sometimes abruptly thin. Commonly confounded
with H. niveus, but it is more difficult to distinguish it from white
forms of H. pratensis. It is distinguished chiefly by its smaller
stature, by the color being constantly white, sometimes becoming pale,
by the _obtuse pileus_ being scarcely turbinate, _at length cracked into
patches and floccose when dry_, and by the gills being thinner, etc.

In pastures. Common. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 12×5–6µ _Cooke_.

Tastes like M. oreades. _M.J.B._ Delicious broiled or stewed. _Cooke._

“Mony littles make muckle,” says the Scotch proverb. It applies well to
the brave little toadstool looking through the first grass of lawns for
the coming of spring, and coming again in the autumn, defiant of early
frosts. Small though it be, its numbers soon fill the basket.

The “Ivory Caps” are plentiful, and extend their haunts to the woods,
where thick mold or grassy places abound.


=H. ni´veus= Fr.—_niveus_, snow-white. (Plate XXXVII, fig. 7, p. 146.)
Wholly white. =Pileus= scarcely reaching 1 in. broad, _somewhat
membranaceous_, and without a more compact disk, hence truly
_umbilicate_, bell-shaped then convex, smooth, striate and viscid when
moist, not cracked when dry. =Flesh= thin, everywhere equal, white,
hygrophanous. =Stem= 2 in. or a little more long, 1–2 lines thick,
_tubed_, _equal_, even, smooth, tense and straight. =Gills= decurrent,
_distant_, _thin_, scarcely connected by veins, arcuate, quite entire.

Thinner, _tougher_, and later than H. virgineus, etc. Being hygrophanous
the pileus is shining white when dry. Very tender forms occur.

In pastures. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 7×4µ _Cooke_.

The H. niveus, H. virgineus, “Ivory Caps” as M.C. Cooke calls them, are
pretty and plentiful in some sections. In the West Virginia mountains,
along grass-grown road-sides, their purity and exquisite perfume
attracted me in 1881. I have them and a few others to thank for seducing
me into becoming a mycophagist. I think of them affectionately. I have
seldom met with them since. They are found on lawns and in pastures and
on grassy edges of woods, early in spring and late in autumn.


=H. boreal´is= Pk.—northern. =Pileus= thin, convex or expanded, smooth,
moist, white, sometimes striatulate. =Gills= arcuate-decurrent, distant,
white. =Stem= smooth, equal or tapering downward, stuffed, white.

=Plant= 2 in. high. =Pileus= 8–12 lines broad. =Stem= 1 line thick.

Ground in woods. Croghan and Copake. September and October.

The species is related to H. niveus but the pileus is not viscid.
_Peck_, 26th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found at Mt. Gretna, Pa., October 20, 1898, ground in mixed woods. The
cap is white, silky, smooth, _not_ viscid. Stem likewise.

A neat species pleasant in every way.


                  ** _Gills ventricose, adnate, etc_.


=H. dis´tans= Berk.—distant (of the gills). =Pileus= about 2 in. broad,
white, with a silky luster, here and there stained with brown, somewhat
fleshy, plane or depressed, viscid. =Stem= white above, _gray_ below,
and attenuated, not spotted. =Gills= decurrent, _few_, _very distant_,
somewhat ventricose, pure white then tinged with ash-color, interstices
obscurely wrinkled.

Often umbilicate. Remarkable for the few and distant gills. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 10×8µ _Cooke_.

Caps white, shaded to light pinkish-brown toward center. Gills very
distant. Leaves adhere to cap.

Specimens tested were of mild, pleasant flavor.


=H. sphæro´sporus= Pk. =Pileus= fleshy and thick in the center,
sub-obconic, convex, obtuse or slightly umbonate, whitish, inclining to
reddish-brown, the margin incurved. =Flesh= firm, white. =Gills= rather
broad, subdistant, adnate or slightly decurrent, white. =Stems= tufted,
flexuous, solid, glabrous, often slightly thickened at the base, colored
like the pileus. =Spores= globose, 6–8µ broad.

=Pileus= 6–12 lines broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 2–3 lines thick.

Iowa. October. Communicated by C. McIlvaine.

The fresh plant is said to have no decided odor, but when partly dried
it emits a slight but rather unpleasant odor. It belongs apparently to
the section Camarophyllus, and is related to Hygrophorus Peckii. _Peck_,
Torr. Bull., Vol. 22, No. 12.

Received by the writer from Hon. Thomas Updegraff, MacGregor, Iowa, and
forwarded to Professor Peck as a new species.

The fungus has but slight taste and is without odor when fresh.

It is probably edible. Not received in sufficient quantity to test.

                          * _Gills decurrent._


=H. cera´ceus= Fr.—_cera_, wax. =Pileus= about 1 in. broad,
_waxy-yellow, shining_, slightly fleshy, thin, but slightly firm,
convexo-plane, obtuse, slightly pellucid-striate, viscid. =Stem= 1–2 in.
and more long, about 2 lines thick, _hollow_, often _unequal_, flexuous
and at length compressed, even, smooth, of the same color as the pileus,
never darker at the apex. =Gills= _adnato-decurrent, broad, almost
triangular_, distinct, yellow. _Fries._

Fragile; easily distinguished from others by its waxy (not changeable)
color. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 8×6µ _Cooke_.

Eaten in Germany.

Found at Angora and Kingsessing, Philadelphia, 1887. August to October.
Open grassy places in woods, and in pastures. Scattered and in troops.
Excellent. Stew slowly.


=H. cantharel´lus= Schw. _Gr_—a small vase. (Plate XXXVII, fig. 5, p.
146.) =Pileus= thin, convex, at length umbilicate or centrally
depressed, minutely squamulose, moist, bright red, becoming orange or
yellow. =Gills= distant, subarcuate, decurrent, yellow, sometimes tinged
with vermilion. =Stem= smooth, equal, subsolid, sometimes becoming
hollow, concolorous, whitish within.

=Height= 2–4 in., breadth of pileus 6–12 lines. =Stem= 1–2 lines thick.

Swamps and damp shaded places in fields or woods. July to September.
Common. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Var. _fla´va_. Pileus and stem pale yellow. Gills arcuate, strongly
decurrent.

Var. _fla´vipes_. Pileus red or reddish. Stem yellow.

Var. _fla´viceps_. Pileus yellow. Stem red or reddish.

Var. _Ro´sea_. Has the pileus expanded and the margin wavy scalloped.
Swamps. Sandlake. _Peck_, 23d Rep.

Common in the Adirondack region, and throughout Pennsylvania and New
Jersey, in all its varieties.

The resemblance to H. miniatus in color is great, but there is a marked
difference in the gills, which extend further down the thinner stem. It
is tougher, and takes longer to cook. It has a flavor of its own which
is enjoyed by some and condemned by others.


=H. cocci´neus= Schaeff.—of a scarlet color. (Plate CXXXVI, fig. 6, p.
508.) =Pileus= 1–2 in. and more broad, _at first bright scarlet, then
soon changing color and becoming pale_, slightly fleshy, convex, then
plane and often unequal, _obtuse_, at first viscid and even, _smooth_,
not floccose-scaly. =Flesh= of the same color as the pileus. =Stem= 2
in. long, 3–4 lines thick, _hollow_, then _compressed_ and rather even,
not slippery, _scarlet upward, always yellow at the base_. =Gills=
wholly adnate, _decurrent with a tooth_, plane, distant, connected by
veins, watery-soft as if fatty, when full grown _purplish at the base,
light yellow in the middle, glaucous at the edge_. _Fries._

Flesh of the pileus descending into the gills and forming a trama of the
same color. Fragile. Varying in stature, easily mistaken for some of the
following species which are of the same color. Pileus at length becoming
yellow. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 10–12×6µ _Cooke_; 7×4µ _Morgan_.

Edible. _Cooke_, _Peck_.

In woods and pastures. In troops. Common in West Virginia, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey. _McIlvaine._

Excellent when stewed for twenty minutes.

=H. fla´vo-dis´cus= Frost—_flavus_, yellow; _discus_, disk. =Pileus=
convex or plane, smooth, glutinous, white with a pale-yellow or
reddish-yellow disk. =Flesh= white. =Gills= adnate or decurrent,
subdistant, white, sometimes with a slight flesh-colored tint, the
inter-spaces sometimes veiny. =Stem= subequal, solid, glutinous, white,
sometimes slightly stained with yellow. =Spores= elliptical, 6–8×4µ.

=Plant= 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–8 lines thick.

Pine woods. West Albany. November.

This, like H. fuligineus, has a short white space at the top of the
stem, free from the viscidity that exists elsewhere. It resembles in
many respects Hygrophorus speciosus, which has the pileus red, fading to
yellow with advancing age. Perhaps the three may yet prove to be forms
of one very variable species, for the most conspicuous differences
between them consist in the colors of the pileus. The constancy with
which the three styles of coloration has thus far been maintained
indicates a specific difference, but color alone is not generally
regarded as having any specific value. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 6.4–7.6×4µ _Peck_.

I find this very good but its dirty pellicle should be peeled before
using. _Peck_, in letter, 1896.

Mr. Hollis Webster writes of H. flavo-discus (Yellow Sweet Bread) in
Bull. No. 45, of the Boston Mycological Club, 1897: “This is a mushroom
worth going a long way to get. It is abundant in rich woods under pines
in certain localities, and is a great favorite with those who know it.
It is easily prepared and requires little cooking.”

I have eaten enjoyably of it since 1881.

Plentiful in the Jersey pines, in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, and
equal to any toadstool of its size.


(Plate XL.)

[Illustration:

  HYGROPHORUS FULIGINEUS.
  About one-half natural size.

=H. fuligi´neus= Frost—resembling soot. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane,
glabrous, very viscid or glutinous, grayish-brown or soot-color, the
disk often darker or almost black. =Gills= subdistant, adnate or
decurrent, white. =Stem= solid, viscid or glutinous, white or whitish.
=Spores= elliptical, 7–9×5µ.

The Sooty hygrophorous resembles the Club-stemmed clitocybe in the color
of its cap, but in nearly every other respect it is different. When
moist the cap is covered with an abundant gluten which when dry gives it
a shining appearance as if varnished. The color varies from
grayish-brown to a very dark or sooty-brown with the central part
usually still darker or almost black, but never with an umbo. The flesh
and the gills are white. The stem also is white or but slightly shaded
toward the base with the color of the cap. It is variable in length and
shape, being long or short, straight or crooked, everywhere equal in
thickness or tapering toward the base. It is glutinous and unpleasant to
handle.

The cap is 1–4 in. broad, the stem 2–4 in. long, and 4–8 lines thick.
The plants grow either singly or in tufts. In the latter case the caps
are often irregular from mutual pressure.

The plants occur early in October and November, in pine woods or woods
of pine and hemlock intermixed.

This mushroom is tender and of excellent flavor, but its sticky and
often dirty covering should be peeled before cooking. _Peck_, 49th Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

Found at Angora, near Philadelphia, August 1, 1897. Densely cespitose.

Raw it tastes like dead leaves. Tender and of fine flavor when cooked.


=H. minia´tus= Fr.—_minium_, red lead. (Plate XXXVII, fig. 4, p. 146.)
=Pileus= thin, fragile, at first convex, becoming nearly plane, glabrous
or minutely squamulose, often umbilicate, generally red. =Gills=
distant, adnate, yellow, often tinged with red. =Stem= slender,
glabrous, colored like the pileus. =Spores= elliptical, white, 8µ long.

=Cap= ½-2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 1–2 lines thick. _Peck_, 48th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Var. _lutes´cens_. Pileus yellow or reddish-yellow. Stem and gills
yellow. Plant often cespitose. _Peck_, 41st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 10×6µ _Cooke_; elliptical, white.

Grows where it pleases and abundantly throughout the land. In wet
weather I have found it in July and late in autumn.

Professor Peck says: It is scarcely surpassed by any mushroom in
tenderness of substance and agreeableness of flavor.

The gunner for partridges will not shoot rabbits; the knowing toadstool
seeker will pass all others where H. miniatus abounds.

                        ** _Gills adnexed, etc._


=H. puni´ceus= Fr.—blood-red. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, glittering
blood-scarlet, in dry weather and when old becoming pale especially at
the disk, slightly fleshy for its breadth, at first bell-shaped, obtuse,
commonly repand or lobed, very irregular, even, smooth, viscid. =Flesh=
of the same color, fragile. =Stem= 3 in. long, ½-1 in. thick, solid when
young, at length hollow, very stout (not compressed), ventricose
(attenuated at both ends), striate, and for the most part squamulose at
the apex, when dry light yellowish or of the same color as the pileus,
always white and often incurved at the base. =Gills= ascending,
ventricose, 2–4 lines broad, thick, distant, white-light yellow or
yellow and often reddish at the base. _Fries._

The largest of the group and very handsome. It certainly differs from H.
coccineus, for which it is commonly mistaken, in stature, in the adnexed
gills, and in the white base of the striate stem. The attachment of the
gills varies, but from the form of the pileus they ascend to the base of
the cone and appear free.

In pastures. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 8×5µ _Cooke_.

Edible. _Cooke._ No harm would come of confusing it with the vermilion
mushroom—H. miniatus Pk.


=H. con´icus= Fr.—conical. =Pileus= thin, submembranaceous, fragile,
smooth, conical, generally acute, sometimes obtuse, the margin often
lobed. =Gills= rather close and broad, subventricose, narrower toward
the stem, free, terminating in an abrupt tooth at the outer extremity,
scarcely reaching the margin, yellow. =Stem= equal, fibrous-striate,
yellow, hollow.

=Height= 3–6 in., breadth of pileus 6–12 lines. =Stem= 1–2 lines thick.

Ground in woods and open places. North Elba and Center. August to
October.

The color of the pileus is variable. I have taken specimens with it pale
sulphur-yellow and others with it bright red or scarlet. The plant turns
black in drying. _Peck_, Rep. 23, New York State Bot.

=Spores= 10×7µ _Cooke_; 10×6µ _Morgan_.

An old-time cure-all had medicinal virtues proportionate to its
offensiveness. Old-time writers, contrariwise, gave every toadstool a
bad name which changed color or displeased their noses. The pretty
little Hygrophorus conicus, for these reasons, has, until now, been
under the ban of suspicion. M.C. Cooke, in his handy book, Edible and
Poisonous Mushrooms, was the first to lighten its sentence and make it a
sort of ticket-of-leave culprit.

The writer has frequently eaten it, and is glad to vouch for its
harmlessness and testify to its eminent respectability.


=H. chloroph´anus= Fr. _Gr_—greenish-yellow. =Pileus= 1 in. broad,
commonly bright sulphur-yellow, sometimes, however, scarlet, not
changing color, somewhat membranaceous, very fragile, at first convex,
then plane, obtuse, orbicular and lobed, and at length cracked, smooth,
viscid, striate. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 2–3 lines thick, hollow, equal,
round, rarely compressed, wholly even, smooth, viscid when moist,
shining when dry, wholly unicolorous, rich light yellow. =Gills=
emarginato-adnexed, very ventricose, with a thin decurrent tooth, thin,
distant, distinct. _Fries._

Very much allied to H. conicus, but never becoming black, and otherwise
certainly distinguished by its convex, obtuse, striate pileus, by its
even and viscous stem, and by its emarginato-free, thin, somewhat
distant, whiter gills. Like H. ceraceus in appearance.

In grassy and mossy places. Common. August to October. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 8×5µ _Cooke_; 8µ _Q._

Received from E.B. Sterling, Trenton, N.J., August, 1897.

Open grassy woods.

But three specimens were tested. They were in every way agreeable.

acute, decurrent or adnate and often branched. =Stem= stout, central,
rarely excentric except in those growing on trunks. =Spores= globose,
minutely echinulate, white, rarely yellowish.

Nearly all grow on the ground.

Distinguished from all other fungi by the presence of a granular milk
which pervades every part of the plant and especially the gills; it is
commonly white, sometimes changing color and in section Dapetes highly
colored from the first. The nature of the milk, especially its taste,
whether acrid, subacrid or mild, must be carefully noted in
distinguishing species, as it is the most useful characteristic.

In Russula, the only allied genus, the milk-bearing cells are present,
but their contents do not appear as milk.

Many of the species are peppery, acrid, astringent; some mildly so,
others will be long remembered if tasted raw. Yet not a species is
hotter than some radishes, onions, and others of our favorite
vegetables. Who would condemn them because they are peppery? There is
not a single species of Lactarius which retains its pepperiness after
cooking. This quality has to be and is supplied by one of our favorite
condiments—pepper itself. Simply because they are _toadstools_ and
_hot_, they have been condemned without trial. It is remarkable that not
one of the fungi known to be deadly gives any warning by appearance or
flavor of the presence of a poison. The day will probably come when it
can be said that if toadstool eaters will confine themselves to _hot_
species, otherwise attractive, they will run no risk. Panus stypticus is
astringent, not hot.

Poisonous, and Gillet declares it to be deleterious and even dangerous,
and that in the raw state it is a very strong drastic purgative. On the
other hand, Cordier states that almost all authors agree in stating that
it is eaten with impunity, and that Letellier has eaten it more than
once without inconvenience.

Cooke states: “Whether it is poison is rather uncertain, and probably
assumed from its acridity.”

Bulliard says: “It is very acrid and this is changed by heat into an
astringent of such power that a very little suffices to produce the most
terrible accidents.” On the other hand, Boudier says that the presence
of an acrid milk is an indication of no importance, that in certain
parts of the country they eat such Lactaria as even L. piperatus and do
not experience any trouble. Certain Russulæ as acrid as any Lactaria are
known to be inoffensive.

The Russians preserve it in salt and eat it seasoned with oil and
vinegar.


=L. tur´pis= Fr.—_turpis_, base, from its ugly appearance. =Pileus=
large, as much as 3–12 in. broad, _olivaceous inclining to umber_,
fleshy, rigid, convex becoming plane, disk-shaped or umbilicate, at
length depressed, innately hairy at the circumference or wholly covered
over with tenacious gluten, _zoneless_, sometimes tawny toward the
margin, _at length_ entirely _inclining to umber_; _margin for a long
time involute, at the first villous, olivaceous-light-yellow_, then more
or less flattened, at length often densely furrowed. =Flesh= compact,
white, then slightly reddish. =Stem= 1½-3 in. long, ½-1 in. and more
thick, _solid_, hard, equal or _attenuated downward_, even or pitted and
uneven, but not spotted, viscid or dry, _pallid or dark olivaceous_,
ochraceous-whitish at the apex. =Gills= adnato-decurrent, thin, 1–2
lines broad, much crowded, forked, _white straw-color_, spotted brownish
when broken or bruised. =Milk= acrid, white, unchangeable. _Fries._

Gregarious, _rigidly and compactly fleshy_; habit almost that of
Paxillus involutus. It varies with the stem hollow, and the pileus
somewhat zoned.

=Spores= spheroid or subspheroid, uniguttate, echinulate, 6–8µ _K._;
minutely spinulose, 6–8µ _Massee_.

New Jersey, Trenton, _E.B. Sterling_; North Carolina, _Curtis_,
_Schweinitz_; Mt. Gretna, Pa. September, 1898. Along road in woods,
moist places. _McIlvaine._

The species is attractive by its very homeliness and odd individuality.
It is not inviting. Cooked it is coarse and resembles L. piperatus. An
emergency species.


=L. controver´sus= Fr.—_contra_, against; _verto_, to turn. =Pileus= 3
in. and more broad, fleshy, compact, rigid, at the first convex, broadly
umbilicate, when fuller grown _somewhat funnel-shaped, oblique_, on
emerging from the ground dry, flocculose, _whitish_, then with rain
smooth, viscid, _reddish, with blood-colored spots and zones_
(especially toward the margin), margin acute when young, closely
involute, more or less villous. =Flesh= _very firm_. =Stem= commonly 1
in. long and thick, sometimes, however, 2 in. long and then manifestly
attenuated toward the base and often excentric, _solid, obese_, even but
pruinate and as if striate at the apex from the obsoletely decurrent
tooth of the gills, wholly _white_, never pitted. =Gills= decurrent,
thin, very crowded, 1–2 lines broad, with many shorter ones intermixed,
but rarely branched, pallid-white-flesh-color. =Milk= white,
unchangeable, plentiful. _Fries._

Odor weak but pleasant, taste very acrid. Allied to L. piperatus.

In woods. Uncommon. August to October. _Stevenson._

=Spores= echinulate, 8×6µ _W.G.S._; globose, rough, 6–8µ _Massee_.

=L. blen´nius= Fr. _Gr_—slimy. =Pileus= 3–5 in. across. =Flesh= thick,
firm; soon expanded and more or less depressed, glutinous, dingy
greenish-gray, often more or less zoned with drop-like markings; margin
at first incurved and downy. =Gills= slightly decurrent, crowded,
narrow, whitish or with an ochraceous tinge. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, up to
1 in. thick at the apex, where it expands into the thick flesh of the
pileus, often attenuated at the base, viscid, colored like the stem or
paler, soon hollow. =Milk= persistently white, very acrid. =Spores=
subglobose, 7–8×6µ.

In woods, on the ground, very rarely on trunks.

L. turpis somewhat resembles the present species but differs in the
darker olive-brown pileus and the yellow down on the incurved margin,
especially when young. _Massee._

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, fleshy, rarely subzonate, convex, the margin
generally involute and adpresso-tomentose (quite smooth, _Fries_); at
length more or less depressed, dull cinereous-green, at first viscid,
more or less pitted. =Milk= white, not changeable. =Gills= rather
narrow, pale ochraceous, scarcely forked, not connected by veins. =Stem=
1 in. long, ¼-½ in. thick, paler than the pileus, attenuated downward,
obtuse, smooth, at length hollow, sometimes pitted, very acrid. _Berk._

Edible. Coarse.

=L. insul´sus= Fr.—tasteless. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, convex and
umbilicate, then funnel-shaped, glabrous, viscid, _more or less zonate,
yellowish_, the margin naked. =Gills= thin, close, adnate or decurrent,
some of them forked at the base, whitish or pallid. =Stem= 1–2 in. long,
4–6 lines thick, equal or slightly tapering downward, stuffed or hollow,
whitish or yellowish, generally spotted. =Spores= 7.6–9µ. =Milk= white,
taste acrid.

Thin woods and open, grassy places. Greenbush and Sandlake, N.Y. July
and August.

Our plant has the pileus pale yellow or straw color, and sometimes
nearly white, but European forms have been described as having it
orange-yellow and brick-red. It is generally, though often obscurely,
zonate. The zones are ordinarily more distinct near the margin, where
they are occasionally very narrow and close. The milk in the Greenbush
specimens had a thin, somewhat watery appearance. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. July to September. Common in
mixed woods and grassy places. _McIlvaine._

Edible. _Cordier_, _Curtis_.

L. insulsus is another peppery member of Lactarius which has suffered
unjustly. I have eaten it since 1881, and think it the best of the hot
milk species. Its flesh is not as coarse as others, and is of better
flavor. There is little difference in quality between it and L.
deliciosus.


=L. hys´ginus= Fr. _Gr_—a crimson dye. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, rigid, at
first convex, then nearly plane, umbilicate or slightly depressed, even,
viscid, zoneless or rarely obscurely zonate, _reddish-incarnate,
tan-color or brownish-red_, becoming paler with age, the thin margin
inflexed. =Gills= close, adnate or subdecurrent, whitish, becoming
yellowish or cream-colored. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 4–8 lines thick, equal,
glabrous, stuffed or hollow, colored like the pileus, or a little paler,
sometimes spotted. =Milk= white, taste acrid.

Woods. Sandlake and Canoga, N.Y. July and August. Not common.

The reddish hue of the pileus distinguishes this species from its
allies. The gluten or viscidity of the pileus in our specimens was
rather tenacious and persistent. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= subglobose, whitish on black paper, yellowish on white paper,
9–10µ _Peck_; 10×7–8µ _Massee_.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1897. Mixed woods. August, September.

Not very acrid. The entire acridity disappears in cooking. Several
specimens were found and eaten, enough to prove it esculent and of good
quality.

                    *** PIPERATI. _Pileus dry, etc._


=L. plum´beus= Fr.—like _plumbum_, lead. =Pileus= 2—5 in. broad,
compact, convex, then infundibuliform, dry, unpolished _sooty or
brownish-black_. =Gills= crowded, white, or yellowish. =Stem= 1.5–3 in.
long, 3–6 lines thick, solid, equal, thick. =Milk= white, acrid,
_unchangeable_. =Spores= 6.3–7.6µ.

The specimens which I have referred to this species were found in the
Catskill mountains several years ago, growing in hemlock woods, under
spruce and balsam trees. I have not met with the species since. The
pileus in the larger specimens had a minutely tomentose appearance, but
in the dried specimens this has disappeared. They also varied in color
from blackish-brown to pinkish-brown and grayish-brown, but they can
scarcely be more than a mere form or variety of the species the
description of which, as given by Fries, I have quoted. In the Handbook
the pileus is described as dark fuliginous-gray or brown, and Gillet
describes it as black-brown, dark fuliginous or lead color, and adds
that the plant is poisonous and the milk very acrid and burning. Cordier
says that the flesh is white and the taste bitter and disagreeable.
_Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=L. pergame´nus= Fr.—parchment. _White._ =Pileus= fleshy, pliant, convex
then plano-depressed, spread, zoneless, slightly wrinkled, smooth.
=Stem= stuffed, smooth, changing color. =Gills= _adnate_, very narrow,
_horizontal_, very crowded, branched, white, then straw-color. =Milk=
white, acrid.

Very much allied to L. piperatus, but differing in the _stem_ being
stuffed, at length softer internally, elongated, 3 in., unequal,
attenuated downward and here and there ascending, _quite smooth_; in the
_pileus_ being _thinner, pliant_, elastic, most frequently irregular and
excentric, for the most part flexuous, at first convex (not umbilicate),
then _rather plane, the surface very smooth_, but unpolished and
_wrinkled_ in a peculiar manner; and in the _gills_ being adnate, not
decurrent, _very crowded, very narrow_ (scarcely 1 line broad), always
_straight and horizontal_, not arcuate or extended upward, _soon
straw-color_. The flesh is very milky, but the gills are sparingly so.
_Fries._

In woods. October.

=Spores= subglobose, rather irregular, 6–8µ _C.B.P._; broadly
elliptical, echinulate, 7×5–6µ _Massee_.

Eaten on the continent and Nova Scotia. Edible. _Cooke._

North Carolina, _Curtis_; New England, _Frost_; Ohio, _Morgan._


=L. pipera´tus= Fr.—_piper_, pepper. (Plate XLI, fig. 1, p. 160.)
=Pileus= 4–9 in. broad, _white_, fleshy, rigid, umbilicate when young,
reflexed (margin at first involute) at the circumference, when full
grown wholly _funnel-shaped_, for the most part regular, even, smooth,
zoneless. =Flesh= white. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 1–2 in. thick, solid,
obese, equal or obconical, even, obsoletely pruinose, white. =Gills=
_decurrent, crowded, narrow_, scarcely broader than 1 line, obtuse at
the edge, _dividing by pairs_, arcuate then all _extended upward_ in a
straight line, white, here and there with yellow spots. =Milk= white,
unchangeable, plentiful and very acrid.

_Compact, firm, dry_, inodorous. The pileus becomes obsoletely yellow
when old. Although the gills are spotted with yellow, they do not change
to straw color like those of L. pergamenus. _Fries._

=Spores= white, nearly smooth, 6.3–7.6µ _Peck_; subglobose, 8–9µ
diameter _Massee_; 5×6µ _W.G.S._

Pennsylvania, West Virginia, 1881–1885. New Jersey, Pennsylvania in
woods and on grassy places. July to October. _McIlvaine._

Edible. _Curtis._

L. piperatus is a readily distinguished species. It is very common. In
1881, after an extensive forest fire in the West Virginia forests, I saw
miles of the blackened district made white by a growth of this fungus.
It was the phenomenal growth which first attracted my attention to
toadstools. I collected it then in quantity and used it, with good
results, as a fertilizer on impoverished ground.

It has been eaten for many years in most countries, yet a few writers
continue to warn against it. It is the representative fungus of its
class—meaty, coarse, fair flavor. It is edible and is good food when one
is hungry and can not get better. It is best used as an absorbent of
gravies.


=L. decepti´vus= Pk.—deceiving. =Pileus= 3–5 in. broad, compact, at
first convex and umbilicate, then expanded and centrally depressed or
subinfundibuliform, _obsoletely tomentose or glabrous_ except on the
margin, white or whitish, often varied with yellowish or sordid stains,
the margin at first involute and _clothed with a dense, soft or cottony
tomentum_, then spreading or elevated and more or less fibrillose.
=Gills= rather broad, distant or subdistant, adnate or decurrent, some
of them forked, whitish, becoming cream-colored. =Stem= 1–3 in. long,
8–18 lines thick, equal or narrowed downward, solid, pruinose-pubescent,
white. =Spores= white, 9–12.7µ. =Milk= white, taste acrid.

Woods and open places, especially under hemlock trees. Common. July to
September.

Trial of its edible qualities was made without any evil consequences.
The acridity was destroyed by cooking. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Alabama, _U. and E._; New York, _Peck_, 38th Rep.; West Virginia,
1881–1885, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. Woods and open places. July to
October. _McIlvaine._

In common with all peppery Lactarii the present species loses the
quality in cooking. The edible qualities then depend upon texture,
substance, flavor. The species is coarse but meaty and of fair flavor.


=L. velle´reus= Fr.—_vellus_, fleece. =Pileus= 2–5 in. broad, compact,
at first convex and umbilicate, then expanded and centrally depressed or
subinfundibuliform, the _whole surface minutely velvety-tomentose, soft
to the touch_, white or whitish, the margin at first involute, then
reflexed. =Gills= distant or subdistant, adnate or decurrent, sometimes
forked, whitish becoming yellowish or cream-colored. =Stem= .5–2 in.
long, 6–16 lines thick, firm, solid, equal or tapering downward,
pruinose-pubescent, white. =Milk= white, taste acrid. =Spores= white.

Woods and open places. Common. July to September. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

=Spores= white, nearly smooth, 7–9µ. _Peck_; 4×8µ _W.G.S._

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. Woods and open places. July to
October. _McIlvaine._

Poisonous according to some authors. _Cordier._ Edible. _Leveille._
Eaten it for eighteen years. _McIlvaine._

This common, very acrid species is characterized by the downy covering
of its cap.

It is a coarse species, but meaty. Its acridity is lost in cooking, when
it makes a fair dish.


=L. involu´tus= Soppitt.—involved. Every part white or with a very
slight ochraceous tinge. =Pileus= 1–2 in. across, flesh about 1½ lines
thick, equal up to the margin, compact, rigid, convex, soon becoming
plane or slightly depressed, margin strongly and persistently involute,
extreme edge minutely silky, remainder even and glabrous. =Gills= very
slightly decurrent, densely crowded, not ½ line broad, sometimes forked.
=Stem= ⅔-1 in. long, 2–3 lines thick, equal, or slightly thickened at
the base, glabrous, even, solid, very firm. =Milk= white, unchangeable,
not scanty, very hot. =Spores= obliquely elliptical, smooth, 5×3µ.

Very firm and rigid, resembling in habit L. vellereus in miniature. Most
nearly allied to L. scoticus, but known at once by the exceedingly
narrow, densely-crowded gills and the smooth, elliptical spores.
_Massee._

West Virginia, 1881–1885, plentiful. Angora, West Philadelphia. August,
September, 1897. In mixed woods. _McIlvaine._

Much smaller than L. piperatus. =Pileus= convex, then plane with
depressions in center, margin involute. =Gills= slightly decurrent,
densely crowded, very narrow. =Stem= short, firm, solid. =Milk= white,
very hot.

L. involutus is readily mistaken for small forms of L. vellereus and L.
piperatus. The extremely narrow gills, so close and firm that it takes
sharp eyes to follow them, are a distinguishing mark.

Its flesh is of same consistency as L. piperatus—hard and coarse. It
loses its pepperiness in cooking and is a good emergency plant, or
solvent.

         II.—DAPETES—_daps_, food. =Milk= highly colored, etc.

America is rich in this section. Fries records but two species, L.
deliciosus and L. sanguifluus, while America has four. The edible
properties of three are known to be good; L. subpurpureus has not come
under observation, but is added to complete the series as it is probably
edible and is well marked by its dark-red milk. _McIlvaine._


=L. delicio´sus= Fr.—delicious. (Plate XLI, fig. 3, p. 160.) =Pileus=
2–6 in. broad, _orange-brick-color, yellowish or grayish-orange_,
becoming pale, fleshy, when quite young _depressed in the center_,
margin naked, involute, then plano-depressed or broadly funnel-shaped
with the margin unfolded, smooth, slightly viscid, _zoned_ (zones
sometimes obsolete). =Flesh= soft, not compact, pallid, colored at the
circumference only by the juice. =Stem= 1–2 in. and more long, 1 in.
thick, stuffed then hollow, at length fragile, equal or attenuated at
the base, spotted in a pitted manner, of the same color as the pileus or
paler. =Gills= somewhat decurrent, crowded, narrow, arcuate, often
branched, typically _saffron-yellow_, but _becoming pale and always
becoming green when wounded_. =Milk= _aromatic, from the first
red-brick-saffron_. _Fries._

=Spores= white, spheroid, echinulate 7–8µ _K._; 6µ _W.G.S._; echinulate,
9–10×7–8µ _Massee_; subglobose, 7.6–10µ _Peck_.

In woods, under firs, etc.

=Pileus= dingy orange-red becoming pale, often greenish. Every part
turns to a homely green when bruised. It is from 3 to 5 in. across,
thick, convex, then depressed in center, margin at first curved in.
=Gills= decurrent, narrow, saffron-color. =Milk= saffron-red or orange
changing to green; sweet scented but slightly acrid. I have never seen
but one specimen with milk distinctly orange, and changing to green. The
milk in this species varies in color, much depending upon moisture. It
grows in patches, sometimes in clusters.

Edible. _Curtis._

There is no question of its edibility. Old and modern writers applaud
it. Each cooks to his liking and thinks his own way best. It requires
forty minutes' stewing or baking; less time if roasted or fried. It can
be cooked in any way, but, like all Lactarii, it must be well cooked.


=L. in´digo= Schw.—(Plate XLI, fig. 2, p. 160.) =Pileus= 2–5 in. broad,
at first umbilicate with the margin involute, then depressed or
infundibuliform, _indigo-blue with a silvery-gray luster_, zonate,
especially on the margin, sometimes spotted, becoming paler and less
distinctly zonate with age or in drying. =Gills= close, _indigo-blue_,
becoming yellowish and sometimes greenish with age. =Stem= 1–2 in. long,
6–10 lines thick, short nearly equal, hollow, often spotted with blue,
colored like the pileus. =Milk= _dark-blue_.

=Dry= places, especially under or near pine trees. Not rare but seldom
abundant. July to September. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= subglobose, 7.6–9µ long _Peck_.

West Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Solitary and in
groups, in pine and mixed woods. July to September. _McIlvaine._

The exceptional color of L. indigo will halt anyone with ordinary
observing power. It is unnecessary to describe it further. Being a
large, stout plant it frequently lifts the leaf mat as it pushes upward,
making leaf-mounds under which it is hidden, as do many of the
Cortinarii. But even in such instances there are usually a few solitary
plants standing prominently forth as sentinels.

It is edible, but coarse. Good flavor.


=L. chelido´nium= Pk. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, at first convex, then
nearly plane and umbilicate or centrally depressed, _grayish-yellow or
tawny_, at length varied with bluish and greenish stains, often with a
few narrow zones on the margin. =Gills= _narrow_, close, sometimes
forked, anastomosing or wavy at the base, _grayish-yellow_. =Stem= 1–1.5
in. long, 4–6 lines thick, short, subequal, hollow, colored like the
pileus. =Spores= globose, 7.5µ. =Milk= sparse, _saffron-yellow_; taste
mild.

Sandy soil, under or near pine trees. Saratoga and Bethlehem.

The milk of this species resembles in color the juice of celandine,
Chelidonium majus. It is paler than that of L. deliciosus. By this
character and by the dull color of the pileus, the narrow lamellæ, short
stem and its fondness for dry situations, it may be separated from the
other species. Wounds of the flesh are at first stained with the color
of the milk, then with blue, finally with green. A saffron-color is
sometimes attributed to the milk of L. deliciosus, which may indicate
that this species has been confused with that, or that the relationship
of the two plants is a closer one than we have assigned to them. _Peck_,
38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. In mixed woods, gravelly low ground. September, October.
_McIlvaine._

A score or more solitary specimens were found and eaten. The substance
and flavor are not distinguishable from L. deliciosus, which is lauded
to the summit of good toadstools.


=L. subpurpu´reus= Pk.—_sub_, under; _purpureus_, purple. =Pileus= at
first convex, then nearly plane or subinfundibuliform, more or less
spotted and zonate when young, and moist _dark-red with a grayish
luster_. =Gills= close, _dark-red_, becoming less clear and sometimes
greenish-stained with age. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward,
soon hollow, often spotted with red, colored like the pileus, sometimes
hairy at the base. =Spores= subglobose, 9–10µ. =Milk= _dark-red_.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 3–5 lines thick.

Damp or mossy ground in woods and swamps. July and August.

At once known by the peculiar dark-red or purplish hue of the milk,
which color also appears in the spots of the stem and in a more subdued
tone in the whole plant. The color of the pileus, gills and stem is
modified by grayish and yellowish hues. In age and dryness the zones are
less clear, and dried specimens can scarcely be distinguished from L.
deliciosus. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

I have not seen this species.

=L. pal´lidus= Fr.—_pale._ =Pileus= 3–6 in. broad, flesh-color or
clay-color to _pallid, somewhat tan_, fleshy, umbilicato-convex,
depressed, obtuse, margin broadly and for a long time involute, smooth,
gluey, _zoneless_. =Flesh= pallid. =Stem= 2 in. and more long, about ¾
in. thick, somewhat equal, stuffed then _hollow_, even, smooth, of the
same color as the pileus. =Gills= somewhat decurrent, arcuate, rather
broad, 1½-2 lines and more; somewhat thin, crowded, somewhat branched,
whitish at length of the same color as the pileus. =Milk= white,
unchangeable. _Fries._

Taste _somewhat mild_. Stature that of L. deliciosus, _but more lax in
texture and always pallid_. There is a variety with the pileus inclining
to dingy-brown. _Stevenson._

colored like the pileus. =Spores= _yellowish, inclining to pale
flesh-color_, subglobose, 7.5–9µ. =Milk= white, _changing to
sulphur-yellow_, taste tardily acrid, bitterish.

Woods and groves. Common. July to October.

Our plant does not fully accord with the description of the species as
given by Fries. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= subglobose, 7–8µ diameter _Massee_; subglobose, 7.5–9µ _Peck_.

West Virginia, 1881–1885; Mt. Gretna, Pa. July, 1897; New Jersey, common
in mixed woods. July to frost. _McIlvaine._

L. theiogalus possesses all the good qualities of the hot milk species.
While I ate it whenever I chose in West Virginia, I did not again eat it
until 1897 at Mt. Gretna. There several partook of it and thought it
rather coarse, but of good flavor. It requires long cooking.


=L. fuligino´sus= Fr.—_fuligo_, soot. =Pileus= 1–2.5 in. broad, firm,
becoming soft, convex plane or slightly depressed, even, _dry_,
zoneless, _dingy ash-color or buff-gray_, appearing as if covered with a
dingy pruinosity, the margin sometimes wavy or lobed. =Gills= adnate or
subdecurrent, subdistant, whitish then yellowish, becoming _stained with
pink-red or salmon-color where wounded_. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 3–5 lines
thick, equal or slightly tapering downward, firm, stuffed, colored like
the pileus. =Spores= globose, _yellowish_, 7.5–10µ. =Milk= white, taste
tardily and sometimes slightly acrid.

or sordid-white. =Gills= close, adnate or slightly rounded behind,
white, then yellowish. =Stem= 3–5 lines thick, firm, short, smooth,
stuffed, generally tapering downward. =Spores= distinctly echinulate,
yellow, 6µ in diameter. =Flesh= and =Milk= white; taste at first mild,
then acrid.

=Plant= 1.5–2 in. high.

Grassy ground in open woods. Greenbush. July.

The peculiar smoky hue of the pileus and yellow spores enable this
species to be easily recognized. The flesh when wounded slowly changes
to a dull pinkish-color. Related to L. fuliginosus. _Peck_, 24th Rep.

=L. ru´fus= Fr.—red. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, convex and centrally
depressed, then funnel-shaped, generally with a small umbo, glabrous,
sometimes slightly floccose or pubescent when young, especially on the
margin, zoneless, _bay-red or brownish-red_, shining. =Gills= narrow or
moderately broad, sometimes forked, close, subdecurrent, yellowish or
reddish. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 3–5 lines thick, nearly equal, firm,
stuffed, paler than or colored like the pileus. =Spores= white, 7.6–10µ.
=Milk= white, taste very acrid.

Low woods and swamps. North Elba. August. Rare.

The red Lactarius is known by its rather large size, dark-red pileus and
intensely acrid taste. It has been found but once in our state. The
flesh is pinkish and the stem sometimes pruinose. It is designated by
authors as very poisonous and extremely poisonous. Cordier even says
that worms never attack it. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

I have not recognized this species. It is given as markedly POISONOUS.


=L. glycios´mus= Fr. _Gr_—sweet; _Gr_—scent. =Pileus= ½-1½ in. broad,
thin, convex nearly plane or depressed, often with a small umbo or
papilla, _minutely squamulose_, ash-colored, grayish-brown or
smoky-brown, sometimes tinged with pink, the margin even or slightly and
distinctly striate. =Gills= narrow, close, adnate or decurrent, whitish
or yellowish. =Stem= ½-1½ in. long, 1–3 lines thick, equal, glabrous or
obsoletely pubescent, stuffed, rarely hollow, whitish or colored like
the pileus. =Milk= white, taste acrid and unpleasant, sometimes
bitterish, odor _aromatic_. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Smell agreeable, of melilot, as that of L. camphoratus.

=Spores= spheroid, echinulate, 6–8µ _K._; subglobose, size variable,
6–10µ _Massee_.

The American plant, so far as observed, does not have the red hues
ascribed to the European.

Haddonfield, N.J., _T.J. Collins_; Scranton, Pa., _Dr. J.M. Phillips_;
Chester county, Pa., September, 1887, on ground in woods, _McIlvaine_.

This small Lactarius was found on several occasions. Its odor is
attractive, but its taste is not. Cooked it is of high flavor, but will
not be liked by many.


=L. aqui´fluus= Pk.—watery. =Pileus= fragile, fleshy, convex or
expanded, at length centrally depressed, dry, smooth, or sometimes
appearing as if clothed with a minute appressed tomentum, reddish
tan-colored, the decurved margin often flexuous. =Gills= rather narrow,
close, whitish, becoming dull reddish yellow. =Stem= more or less
elongated, equal or slightly tapering upward, colored like the pileus,
smooth, hollow, the cavity irregular as if eroded. =Spores= subglobose,
rough, 7.6µ. =Flesh= colored like the pileus. =Milk= sparse, watery.

=Plant= 3–8 in. high. =Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 5–10 lines thick.

Swamps and wet mossy places in woods. Sandlake and North Elba. August
and September.

The relationship of this plant is with L. serifluus, to which it was
formerly referred, but from which I am now satisfied it is distinct. The
hollow stem is a constant character in our plant, and affords a ready
mark of distinction. The plant, though large, is very fragile, and
breaks easily. The taste is mild or but slightly acrid. Sometimes there
is an obscure zonation on the pileus, which, in large specimens, is apt
to be irregular and much worm-eaten. The milk looks like little drops of
water when first issuing from a wound, but it becomes a little less
clear on exposure to the atmosphere. The decided but agreeable odor of
the dried specimens persists a long time. _Peck_, 28th Rep.

This plant is sometimes cespitose. The pileus when dry is tawny-gray and
scaly or cracked scaly. The margin may be even or coarsely
sulcate-striate. The flesh is grayish or reddish-gray. The color of the
lamellæ varies from creamy-white to tawny-yellow. The stem often has a
conspicuous white myceloid tomentum at its base. I have never found this
plant with a white or milky juice, and therefore I am disposed to regard
it not as a variety of L. helvus, but as a distinct species. Its mild
taste and agreeable odor suggested a trial of its edible qualities. It
is harmless, but the lack of flavor induces me to omit it from the list
of edible species. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Var. _brevis´simus_ Pk. Pileus 1–1.5 in. broad, grayish-buff. Gills
crowded, adnate, yellowish or cream-color. Stem very short, 6–8 lines
long.

Black mucky soil in roads in woods. Township 24, Franklin county.
September.

Plant fragrant; sometimes cespitose. _Peck_, 51st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Angora, West Philadelphia, in moist oak woods. August, 1897,

Flesh rather hard when cooked, and insipid. Good as an absorbent or in
emergency.


=L. lignyo´tus= Fr.—_lignum_, wood. =Pileus= 1–4 in. broad, broadly
convex plane or slightly depressed, dry, with or without a small umbo,
generally rugose-wrinkled, _dark-brown, appearing subpulverulent or as
if suffused with a dingy pruinosity_, the margin sometimes crenately
lobed and distinctly plicate. =Gills= moderately close or subdistant,
adnate, white or yellowish, _slowly changing to pinkish-red or salmon
color where wounded_. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 2–6 lines thick, equal or
abruptly narrowed at the apex, even, glabrous, stuffed, colored like the
pileus, sometimes plicate at the top. =Milk= white, taste mild or
tardily and slightly acrid.

Var. _tenu´ipes_. =Pileus= about 1 in. broad. =Stem= slender, 2–3 in.
long and about 2 lines thick.

Wet or mossy ground in woods and swamps. Adirondack mountains and
Sandlake. July and August. Not rare in hilly and mountainous districts.

West Virginia mountains, 1881–1885; Eagle’s Mere; Mt. Gretna, Pa.
Solitary and gregarious, moist woods and wooded places. July to
September. _McIlvaine._

In my long experience with the plant I have not seen any change of
color, save that, like the white milk of other species, it darkens
slightly to a cream color. I have found it distinctly umbilicate and
quite umbonate in the same patch.

L. lignyotus is one of the best of Lactarii and quite equal to L.
volemus.


=L. corru´gis= Pk.—having wrinkles or folds. =Pileus= 3–5 in. broad,
firm, convex, then nearly plane or centrally depressed, _rugose
reticulated_, covered with a _velvety pruinosity or pubescence, dark
reddish-brown or chestnut-color_, fading with age to tawny-brown.
=Gills= close, dark cream-color or subcinnamon, _becoming paler_ when
old, sordid or brownish where bruised or wounded. =Stem= 3–5 in. long,
6–12 lines thick, equal, solid, glabrous or merely pruinose, paler than
but similar in color to the pileus. =Spores= subglobose, 10–13µ. =Milk=
copious, white, taste mild.

Thin woods. Sandlake, Gansevoort and Brewerton, N.Y. August and
September.

This curious Lactarius is related to L. volemus, from which it may be
separated by its darker colors and its corrugated pileus. The flexuous
reticulated rugæ present an appearance similar to that of the hymenium
of a Merulius. The pileus is everywhere pruinose-pubescent and the gills
bear numerous spine-like or acicular cystidia or spicules, 4–5µ long.
These are so numerous on and near the edges of the gills that they give
them a pubescent appearance. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

I found many at Mt. Gretna, Pa., up to 6½ in. in diameter. Flesh not so
firm as L. volemus. Stem equal, rugulose, flattened in old specimens.
Milk very slightly acrid.

Better in taste and quality than L. volemus.


=L. lute´olus= Pk.—yellowish. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, fleshy, rather
thin, convex or nearly plane, commonly umbilicately depressed in the
center and somewhat rugulose, pruinose or subglabrous, buff-color.
=Flesh= white, taste mild. =Milk= copious, flowing easily, white or
whitish. =Gills= close, nearly plane, adnate or slightly rounded behind,
whitish, becoming brownish where wounded. =Stem= 1–1.5 in. long, 3–5
lines thick, short, equal or tapering downward, solid, but somewhat
spongy within, colored like the pileus. =Spores= globose, 7.6µ broad.

Dry woods. East Milton, Mass. August. _H. Webster._

This species is related to Lactarius volemus and L. hygrophoroides, but
its smaller size and short stem will distinguish it from the former and
its close gills from the latter. Its paler buff-color will separate it
from both. Some specimens have a narrow encircling furrow or depressed
zone near the margin and a slightly darker shade of color on the margin.
The milk constitutes a remarkable feature of the species. According to
the notes of the collector it is exceedingly copious, rather sticky,
serous in character with white particles in suspension. It flows from
many points as soon as the plant is disturbed and it stains the gills.
It is impossible to collect an unstained specimen, so free is the flow
of the milk. He, Mr. Webster, says: “I have never succeeded in picking a
specimen so quietly as to prevent an instant and copious flow of its
milk.” Torrey Bull., Vol. 23, No. 10, 1896.

Angora, West Philadelphia, August, 1897. In oak woods. August,
September. _McIlvaine._

Quite frequent there. My attention was directed to it by the “narrow
encircling furrow or depressed zone near the margin.”

It is of like quality to L. volemus.


=L. Gerar´dii= Pk. =Pileus= 1.5–4 in. broad, broadly convex plane or
slightly depressed, dry, generally rugose-wrinkled, with or without a
small umbo or papilla, _dingy-brown_, the thin spreading margin
sometimes flexuous lobed or irregular. =Gills= _distant_, adnate or
decurrent, _white or whitish_, the interspaces generally uneven. =Stem=
1–2 in. long, 3–6 lines thick, subequal, stuffed or hollow, colored like
the pileus. =Spores= globose, _white_, 9–11.3µ. =Milk= white,
_unchangeable_, taste _mild_.

Woods and open places. Poughkeepsie, _W.R. Gerard_. Greenbush, Sandlake
and Croghan, N.Y. July to September.

This Lactarius closely resembles the Sooty lactarius in color, but
differs from it in its more distant gills, white spores and constantly
mild taste. Wounds of the flesh and gills do not become pinkish-red as
in that plant. From L. hygrophoroides its darker color, hollow stem and
more globose rougher spores separate it. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

In the color of the pileus and stem this species is like the larger
forms of L. fuliginosus. _Peck_, 26th Rep.

=L. vole´mus= Fr.—_volema pira_, a kind of large pear. (Plate XLI, fig.
4, p. 160) =Pileus= 2–5 in. broad, firm, convex, nearly plane or
centrally depressed, rarely funnel-shaped, sometimes with a small umbo,
generally even, _glabrous_, dry, _golden-tawny or brownish-orange_,
sometimes darker in the center, often becoming rimose-areolate. =Gills=
_close_, adnate or subdecurrent, white or yellowish, becoming sordid or
brownish where bruised or wounded. =Stem= 1–4 in. long, 4–10 lines
thick, subequal, variable in length, firm, solid, glabrous or merely
pruinose, colored like the pileus, sometimes a little paler. =Milk=
_copious_, white, taste mild, flat.

Var. _subrugo´sus_. =Pileus= rugose-reticulated on the margin. _Peck_,

=Spores= globose, white, 9–11.3µ _Peck_; 5–6µ diameter _Massee_.

Very delicious raw and celebrated from early times. _Fries._

Common over the United States, well known everywhere and distinguished
for its edible qualities. It is crisp and unless carefully cooked is
hard and granular. It should have long, slow cooking, though it may be
roasted or fried.

[Illustration: LACTARIUS HYGROPHOROIDES.]

=L. hygrophoroi´des= B. and C.—resembling Hygrophorus. =Pileus= 1–4 in.
broad, firm, convex or nearly plane, umbilicate or slightly depressed,
rarely funnel-shaped, glabrous or sometimes with a minute velvety
pubescence or tomentum, dry, sometimes rugose-wrinkled and often
becoming cracked in areas, _yellowish-tawny or brownish-orange_. =Gills=
_distant_, adnate or subdecurrent, white or cream-color, the interspaces
uneven or venose. =Stem= .5–1 in. long, 4–8 lines thick, short, equal or
tapering downward, _solid_, glabrous or merely pruinose, colored like
the pileus. =Spores= subglobose or broadly elliptical, _nearly smooth_,
9–11.3µ. =Milk= white, taste mild.

Grassy ground and borders of woods. Albany, Greenbush and Sandlake. July
and August.

This plant has almost exactly the color of L. volemus, but differs from
it in its distant gills, short stem, less copious milk and less globose
spores. Its flesh is white, with a thickness about equal to the breadth
of the gills. It is probably edible, but has not yet been tested. The
typical L. hygrophoroides is described as having the pileus
yellowish-red and pulverulent, and the gills luteous. It is also
represented as a small plant; but our specimens, while not fully
agreeing with this description, approach so closely to it in some of
their forms that they doubtless belong to the same species. We have
therefore extended the description so that it may include our plant. In
wet weather the pileus sometimes becomes funnel-form by the elevation of
the margin. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1897, grassy grounds and borders of woods. Mixed, moist
woods and grassy borders. July to September. _McIlvaine._

=Pileus= up to 4 in. across. =Stem= 1–2½ in., tapering, equal or
tapering downward. When growing in woods the stem is longer than when
growing on borders.

Its edible qualities are excellent.


=L. mitis´simus= Fr.—_mitis_, mild. =Pileus= 1–3 in. broad,
_golden-tawny_, zoneless, fleshy, thin, somewhat rigid, convex,
_papillate_, depressed, papilla vanishing, even, smooth, somewhat
slippery when moist. =Flesh= pallid. =Stem= elongated, 1–3 in. long, ⅓-½
in. thick, stuffed, then hollow, even, smooth, of the same color as the
pileus. =Gills= adnato-decurrent, somewhat arcuate, then tense and
straight, 1–1½ lines and more broad, thin, crowded, a little paler than
the pileus, most frequently stained with minute red spots. =Milk= white,
_mild_, plentiful.

Thin; very much allied to L. subdulcis, but distinguished by the _taste_
being _mild, then somewhat bitterish_, and especially by the _bright,
golden-tawny, resplendent_ color of the pileus and stem. _Fries._

In mixed and pine woods. August to November. _Stevenson._

(Plate XLIII.)

[Illustration: LACTARIUS SUBDULCIS.]

=L. subdul´cis= Fr.—_sub_; _dulcis_, sweet. =Pileus= .5–2 in. broad,
thin, convex, then plane or slightly funnel-shaped, with or without a
small umbo or papilla, glabrous, even, zoneless, moist or dry,
tawny-red, cinnamon-red or brownish-red, the margin sometimes wavy or
flexuous. =Gills= rather narrow, thin, close, whitish, sometimes tinged
with red. =Stem= 1–2.5 in. long, 1–3 lines thick, equal or slightly
tapering upward, slender, glabrous, sometimes villous at the base,
stuffed or hollow, paler than or colored like the pileus. =Spores=
7.6–9µ. =Milk= white, taste mild or tardily and slightly acrid,
sometimes woody or bitterish and unpleasant. =Flesh= whitish, pinkish or
reddish gray, odor _none_.

Fields, copses, woods, swamps and wet places. July to October. Very
common.

This species grows in almost every variety of soil and locality. It may
be found in showery weather on dry, rocky soil, on bare ground or among
mosses or fallen leaves. In drier weather it is still plentiful in
swamps and wet, shaded places, and in sphagnous marshes. It sometimes
grows on decaying wood. It is also as variable as it is common. Gillet
has described the following varieties:

Var. _cinnamo´meus_. =Pileus= cinnamon-red, sub-shining. =Stem= stuffed,
then hollow; taste mild, becoming slightly acrid or bitter.

Var. _ru´fus_. =Pileus= dull chestnut-red; becoming more concave. =Stem=
spongy; taste mild.

Var. _ba´dius_. =Pileus= bay-red, shining as if varnished, with an
obtuse disk and an inflexed, elegantly crenulate margin. =Stem= very
glabrous, hollow.

The first and second varieties have occurred within our limits. The
first also has the stem elastic and furnished with a whitish or grayish
tomentum or strigose villosity at the base, when growing among moss in
swamps. A form occurred in Sandlake, in which some of the specimens were
proliferous. The umbo had developed into a minute pileus. With us the
prevailing color of the pileus is yellowish-red or cinnamon-red.
Sometimes the color is almost the same as that of L. volemus and L.
hygrophoroides, and again it is a tan-color or a bay-red, as in L.
camphoratus, from which such specimens are scarcely separable, except by
their lack of odor. In young plants the pileus usually has a moist
appearance, which is sometimes retained in maturity. Cordier pronounces
the species edible, and says that he has tested it several times without
inconvenience. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 10µ _Cooke_; 7µ _W.G.S._

West Virginia mountains, 1881–1885; Pennsylvania, New Jersey, everywhere
on moist ground. July to October. _McIlvaine._

Edible. _Curtis._

The description of Fries as enlarged and modified by Professor Peck,
together with that of the varieties placed to the credit of the species
by Gillet, are given above in full. The species with its ascribed
varieties is common and well known. Var. _ba´dius_ occurs in West
Virginia and Pennsylvania. They are all edible and vary but little in
quality. L. subdulcis requires long cooking.


=L. muta´bilis= Pk.—changeable. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, thin, convex or
nearly plane, zonate when moist, reddish-brown, the disk and zones
darker, zoneless when dry, flesh colored like the pileus. =Milk= sparse,
white, taste mild. =Gills= narrow, close, adnate, whitish, with a
yellowish or cream-colored tint when old. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 3–5 lines
thick, equal or tapering upward, stuffed or spongy within, glabrous,
colored like the pileus. =Spores= subglobose, rough, 7.6µ broad.

Low, damp places. Selkirk and Yaphank, N.Y. June and September.

The species is allied to L. subdulcis, from which the larger size and
zonate pileus separate it. The zones disappear in the dry plant, and
this change in the marking of the pileus suggests the specific name.
They appear to be formed by concentric series of more or less confluent
spots and are suggestive of such species as L. deliciosus and L.
subpurpureus. _Peck_, 43d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania. Solitary but frequent. In moist woods and
margins of woods. June to October. _McIlvaine._

I have been familiar with and eaten this plant since 1882, but thought
it might be a variety of L. deliciosus, with light-colored milk.

L. mutabilis is an excellent species, equal to any Lactarius.


=L. camphora´tus= Fr.—_camphor._ =Pileus= 1–2 in. across,
_brown_-brick-red, _somewhat zoned, sometimes zoneless_, fleshy, thin,
depressed, dry, smooth. =Stem= short, 1–2 in., stuffed, somewhat
undulated, of the same color as the pileus. =Gills= adnate, crowded,
_yellowish-brick-color_. =Milk= mild, white, odor agreeable, spicy.
_Fries._

_Strong smelling._ So like L. subdulcis that it can be distinguished
safely only by its odor of melilot when dried. _Stevenson._

=Pileus= .5–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 2–3 lines. _Peck_, 38th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= spherical, echinulate, 6–7µ _Q._; subglobose, 8–9µ _Massee_;
7.6–9µ _Peck_.

Taste and smell not of camphor, but of melilot.

Edible. _Gillet._

Its mild taste distinguishes it at once from L. rufus.

It has high but pleasant flavor. If the flavor is too evident to suit
some tastes, it is well to mix milder species with it.

[Illustration: RUSSULA.]

=Pileus= regular, rigid, usually becoming more or less depressed.
=Flesh= of the pileus descending into the gills forming a cellular
trama. =Veil= and consequently the ring absent. Stem smooth, stout,
rigid, brittle, spongy within. =Gills= rigid, fragile, edge thin and
acute. =Spores= rounded, often echinulate, white or yellowish. On the
ground.

Closely allied to Lactarius but separated by the absence of milk. The
gills of some species exude watery drops in moist weather. Owing to the
similarity of form and the variable coloring many species are difficult
to determine; all the characters should be carefully noted, not omitting
that of the taste.

Russulæ are readily distinguished by the stout, short, brittle stem and
the fragility of the pileus and gills. They especially love open woods
and appear during the summer and fall months, some being found until
sharp frosts occur.

It has been claimed by mushroom growers, until within a few years, that
the spores of the mushroom have to pass through the digestive apparatus
of the horse before they will germinate. It has been conclusively
demonstrated that such a transmission is not a necessity. It was for a
long time my opinion—following the opinion of others—that such
assistance was necessary. In my many efforts to propagate valuable food
species of the wild toadstools I endeavored to find the method by which
the spores were disseminated, and through what digestive medium they
passed—either of insect or animal—before germination. Noticing that the
Russulæ were fed upon by a small black beetle, I planted in suitable
places, not the toadstools, but the beetles found upon them. The result
was that in several instances I grew the Russulæ. My experiments, while
interesting, are not conclusive, because I later found that the same
results could be obtained from the toadstool itself when planted under
its own natural life conditions. It is certain that beetles can not be
raised by planting Russulæ.

The beetles known as tumble-bugs—canthon lævis—deposit eggs in the
center of balls made of animal droppings; dig a hole in the ground and
drop them into it. These droppings frequently contain the spores of the
meadow mushroom. Thus planted with the proper surrounding of manure, and
at the proper depth, the spores germinate, spread mycelium, and a crop
of mushrooms is the result. The beetle becomes a horticulturist. No
wonder the Egyptians, thousands of years ago, made it—the
scarabeus—their sacred emblem, and that, today, the _fleur-de-lis_ of
France, so the Rosicrucians say, perpetuates its glorious worth and
calling.

Most Russulæ are sweet and nutty to the taste; some are as hot as the
fiercest of cayenne, but this they lose upon cooking. To this genus
authors have done especial injustice; there is not a single species
among them known to be poisonous, and, where they are not too strong of
cherry bark and other highly flavored substances, they are all edible;
most of them are favorites. Where they present no objectionable
appearance or taste, their caps make most palatable dishes when stewed,
baked, roasted or escalloped. The time of cooking should be determined
by the consistency of the variety; some will cook in five minutes,
others not under thirty. Salt, butter and pepper are the only
necessaries as seasoning.

                          ANALYSIS OF TRIBES.

     I.—COMPACTÆ (_compingo_, to put together; compact). Page 187.

Pileus fleshy throughout, hence the margin is at first bent inward and
always without striæ, without a distinct gluey pellicle (in consequence
of which the color is not variable, but only changes with age and the
state of the atmosphere). Flesh compact, firm. Stem solid, fleshy. Gills
unequal.

     II.—FURCATÆ (_furca_, a fork. With _forked_ gills). Page 191.

Pileus compact, firm, covered with a thin, closely adnate pellicle,
which at length disappears, margin abruptly thin, at first inflexed,
then spreading, _acute, even_. Stem at first compact, at length
spongy-soft within. Gills _somewhat forked_, with a few shorter ones
intermixed, commonly attenuated at both ends, thin and normally narrow.

               III.—RIGIDÆ (_rigidus_, rigid). Page 194.

Pileus without a viscid pellicle, _absolutely dry, rigid, the cuticle
commonly breaking up into flocci or granules_. Flesh thick, compact,
firm, vanishing away short of the _margin which is straight_ (never
involute), soon spreading, and always _without striæ_. Stem solid, at
first hard, then softer and spongy. Gills, a few dimidiate, others
divided, rigid, _dilated in front and running out with a very broad,
rounded apex_, whence the margin of the pileus becomes obtuse and is not
inflexed. _Exceedingly handsome_, but rather rare.

        IV.—HETEROPHYLLÆ (_R. heterophylla_, the typical species

of the section). Page 198.

Pileus fleshy, firm, with a thin margin which is at first inflexed, then
expanded and striate, covered with a thin adnate pellicle. The gills
consist of many shorter ones mixed with longer ones, along with others
which are forked. Stem solid, stout, spongy within.

        V.—FRAGILES (_fragilis_, fragile or brittle). Page 201.

Pileus more or less fleshy, rigid-fragile, covered with a pellicle which
is always continuous, and in wet weather viscid and somewhat separable;
margin membranaceous, at first convergent and not involute, in
full-grown plants commonly sulcate and tubercular. Flesh commonly
floccose, lax, friable. Stem spongy, at length wholly soft and hollow.
Gills almost all equal, simple, broadening in front, free in the pileus
when closed. Several doubtful forms occur. R. integra is specially
fallacious from the variety of its colors.

* Gills and spores white.

** Gills and spores white, then light-yellowish or bright
lemon-yellowish.

*** Gills and spores ochraceous.


                               COMPAC´TÆ.


=R. ni´gricans= Bull.—_nigrico_, to be blackish. =Pileus= 2–4 in. and
more broad, olivaceous-fuliginous, _at length black_, fleshy to the
margin which is at first bent inwards, convex then flattened,
umbilicato-depressed, when young and moist slightly viscid and even
(without a separable pellicle), at length cracked in scales. =Flesh=
firm, white, when broken becoming red on exposure to the air. =Stem= 1
in. thick, persistently solid, equal, pallid when young, _at length
black_. =Gills= _rounded_ behind, slightly adnexed, _thick, distant_,
unequal, paler, reddening when touched. _Fries._

Compact, obese, inodorous, within and without _at length wholly black_,
in which it differs from all others. The flesh becomes red when broken
because it is saturated with red juice, although it does not exude milk.
Sometimes a very few of the gills are dimidiate.

In woods. Common. June to November. _Stevenson._

Var. _albo´nigra_ Krombh.—_albo_, white; _negro_, to be black. =Pileus=
fleshy, convexo-plane, depressed in the middle, at length funnel-shaped,
viscid, _whitish, smoky about the margin_. =Flesh= white, turning black
when broken. =Stem= solid, stout, dusky, becoming blackened. =Gills=
decurrent, crowded, unequal, dusky-whitish. In grassy places.

=Spores= papillose, 8µ _W.G.S._; subglobose, rough, 8–9µ _Massee_.

New York. Our specimens agree with the description in every respect,
except that the gills are not distant. _Peck_, 32d Rep.

Mild when raw, but with a heavy woody taste.

Cooked it makes a good dish, but does not equal most Russulæ.


=R. purpuri´na= Quel. and Schulz.—purple. (Plate XLV_a_.) =Pileus=
fleshy, margin acute, subglobose, then plane, at length depressed in the
center, slightly viscid in very wet weather, not striate, often split,
pellicle separable, rosy-pink, paling even to light yellow. =Gills=
crowded in youth, afterward subdistant, white, in age yellowish,
reaching the stem, 2–4 lines broad in front, not greatly narrowed
behind, almost equal, not forked. =Stem= spongy, stuffed, very variable,
cylindrical, attenuated above and below the middle, rosy-pink becoming
paler (rarely white) toward the base, color obscure in age. =Flesh=
fragile, white, reddish under the skin; odor slight, taste mild.
=Spores= white, globose, sometimes sub-elliptical, 4–8µ long, minutely
warted.

=Pileus= 1.5–2.5 in. across. =Stem= up to .4 in. thick, 1.2 in. long.

“This is a beautiful and very distinct species easily known by its red
stem, mild taste and white spores.” _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=R. adus´ta= Fr.—_aduro_, to scorch. =Pileus= pallid or whitish,
_grayish-sooty_, equally fleshy, compact, depressed then somewhat
infundibuliform, margin at first inflexed, smooth, then erect, without
striæ. =Flesh= unchangeable. =Stem= solid, obese, of the same color as
the pileus. =Gills= adnate then decurrent, _thin, crowded_, unequal,
white then dingy, not reddening when touched. _Fries._

=Spores= subglobose, almost smooth, 8–9µ _Massee_.

In pine and mixed woods.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, in pine woods and in mixed
woods. August to frost. _McIlvaine._

R. adusta is solitary but often in small troops. It is easily recognized
by the brownish blotches upon its cap, and the crowding of its thin
gills.

The solid flesh must be well cooked. It is then of good flavor.


(Plate XLV_b_.)

[Illustration:

  RUSSULA BREVIPES.
  After Prof. Peck.
]

=R. bre´vipes= Pk.—_brevis_, short; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= 3–5 in.
broad, at first convex and umbilicate, then infundibuliform, dry,
glabrous or slightly villose on the margin, white, sometimes varied with
reddish-brown stains. =Flesh= whitish, taste mild, slowly becoming
slightly acrid. =Lamellæ= thin, close, adnate or slightly rounded
behind; white. =Stem= solid, white.

=Spores= globose, verruculose, 10–13µ.

=Stem= 6–10 lines long, 6–10 lines thick.

Sandy soil in pine woods. Quogue. September.

This species is related to Russula delica, but is easily distinguished
by its short stem and crowded gills. The pileus also is not shining and
the taste is tardily somewhat acrid. From Lactarius exsuccus it is
separated by the character of the gills and the very short stem which is
about as broad as it is long. The spores also are larger than in that
species. The gills in the young plant are sometimes studded with drops
of water. They are not clearly decurrent. Some of them are forked at the
base. The pileus is but slightly raised above the surface of the ground
and is generally soiled by adhering dirt and often marked by rusty or
brownish stains. The plants grew in old roads in the woods where the
soil had been trodden and compacted. _Peck_, 43d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, 1882; Pennsylvania, 1887–1894; New Jersey, 1892. Solitary
in pine and hemlock woods, generally on bare, compact ground. August to
October. _McIlvaine._

This species is a sparse grower, but its good size and respectable
numbers soon fill the basket. When fresh it is of good substance and
flavor.


=R. del´ica= Fr.—_delicus_, weaned. (Milkless, juiceless in gills.)
=White.= =Pileus= 3–5 in. broad, fleshy throughout, firm, umbilicate
then infundibuliform, regular, everywhere even, smooth with a _whitish
luster_, the involute margin without striæ. =Flesh= firm, juiceless, not
very thick, white. =Stem= curt, 1–2 in. long, ½ in. and more thick,
solid, even, smooth, white. =Gills= _decurrent, thin, distant_, very
unequal, white, exuding small watery drops in wet weather. _Fries._

=Spores= minutely echinulate, white, broadly elliptical, 8–10×6–7µ
_Massee_.

In appearance it resembles Lactarius vellereus and L. piperatus, but its
gills do not distill milk or juice. It differs, too, in its mild taste.
It is related to R. brevipes Pk.

A large, coarse species, cup-shaped at maturity. I have found it in
several localities in Massachusetts in July and August. It is of fair
quality cooked, but much inferior to R. virescens, etc. _Macadam._

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, in mixed woods, August to
October. _McIlvaine._

Edible. Taste mild. From the juiceless variety of L. vellereus its mild
taste alone furnishes a separate character. _Peck._

I have eaten it since 1882, but it is not a favorite. Its quality is
fair.


=R. sor´dida= Pk.—dirty. (Plate XLIV, fig. 4, p. 184.) =Pileus= firm,
convex, centrally depressed, dry, sordid-white, sometimes clouded with
brown. =Gills= close, white, some of them forked. =Stem= equal, solid,
concolorous. =Spores= globose, 7.5µ. Taste acrid. =Flesh= changing color
when wounded, becoming black or bluish-black.

=Plant= 4–5 in. high. =Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 6–12 lines thick.

Ground under hemlock trees. Worcester. July.

It resembles L. piperatus in general appearance. The whole plant turns
black in drying. _Peck_, 26th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Ohio, _Morgan_; Pennsylvania, _Herbst_; West Virginia, 1881–1885,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, pine, hemlock and mixed woods, July to
September. _McIlvaine._

It is of better quality than most coarse-grained Russulæ.


                               FURCA´TÆ.


=R. furca´ta= Fr.—_furca_, a fork. =Pileus= 3 in. broad, sometimes
greenish, sometimes umber-greenish, fleshy, compact, gibbous then
plano-depressed or infundibuliform, _even_, smooth, but often _sprinkled
with slightly silky luster_, pellicle here and there separable, margin
thin, at first inflexed, then spreading, always _even_. =Flesh= firm,
somewhat cheesy, white. =Stem= 2 in. or a little more long, solid, firm,
equal or attenuated downward, even, white. =Gills= _adnato-decurrent,
rather thick_, somewhat distant but broad, attenuated at both ends,
frequently forked, shining white. _Fries._

=Spores= globose, echinulate, 6–7µ _C.B.P._; 7–8×9µ _Massee_.

In woods, and grass under trees.

The frequently forked gills, from which the species takes its name,
their being thick and slightly decurrent, help to distinguish it. It is
quite common in its several varieties.

=Taste= mild at first. A slight bitter develops which disappears in
cooking. It is then of good quality, not equal to R. virescens. Older
writers marked it poisonous, doubtless for no other cause than its
slight bitter. I have eaten it freely for fifteen years.


=R. sangui´nea= Fr.—_sanguis_, blood. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, blood-red
or becoming pale round the _even_, spreading, _acute margin_, fleshy,
firm, at first convex, obtuse, then depressed and infundibuliform and
commonly gibbous in the center, polished, even, _moist_ in damp weather.
=Flesh= firm, cheesy, white. =Stem= stout, spongy-stuffed, at first
contracted at the apex, then equal, slightly striate, white or reddish.
=Gills= at first adnate, then truly decurrent, very crowded, very
narrow, connected by veins, fragile, somewhat forked, shining white.
_Fries._

=Spores= 9–10µ diameter _Massee_.

In pine and mixed woods. July to October.

Color same as R. rubra but differs in its hard cheesy flesh, rigid,
slightly yellowish gills in age. The gills of R. sanguinea are truly
decurrent, and pointed in front.

Poisonous. _Stevenson._ Krapp says he has experienced grave
inconveniences from eating it.

Myself and very many friends eat all fresh inviting Russulæ. We do not
discriminate against a single peppery or acrid species, not even the R.
emetica which has been severely maligned. In fact the peppery Russulæ
are usually substantial in flesh and choice in substance.

The opinion of many is that R. sanguinea is one of the best. I have
eaten it for years.


=R. depal´lens= Pers.—_palleo_, to be pale. =Pileus= 3–4 in. across,
pallid-reddish or inclining to dingy-brown, etc., fleshy, firm, convex,
then plane, more rarely depressed, but commonly _irregularly shaped and
undulated_, even, the thin, adnate pellicle presently changing color,
especially at the disk, the spreading margin even, but slightly striate
when old. =Flesh= white. =Stem= about 1½ in. long, solid, firm, commonly
attenuated downward, _white, becoming cinereous_ when old. =Gills=
adnexed, broad, crowded, distinct, but commonly forked at the base,
often with shorter ones intermixed. Inodorous, taste mild. The color of
the pileus is at first pallid-reddish, or inclining to brownish, then
whitish or yellowish, opaque in every stage of growth. It approaches
nearest to the Heterophyllæ. _Fries._

In beech woods, pastures, etc. August to September.

=Spores= subglobose, echinulate, 7–8µ _Massee_.

R. depallens somewhat resembles R. heterophylla. Both are edible. It is
a solitary grower and not common, but when found it occurs in good
quantity. It belongs to the best class of Russulæ.


=R. subdepal´lens= Pk.—_sub_, _de_ and _palleo_, to be pale. =Pileus=
fleshy, at first convex and striate on the margin, then expanded or
centrally depressed and tuberculate-striate on the margin, viscid,
blood-red or purplish red, mottled with yellowish spots, becoming paler
or almost white with age, often irregular. =Flesh= fragile, white,
becoming cinereous with age, reddish under the cuticle, taste mild.
=Lamellæ= broad, subdistant, adnate, white or whitish, the interspaces
venose. =Stem= stout, solid but spongy within, persistently white.

=Spores= white, globose, rough, 8µ broad.

=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.

Under a hickory tree. Trexlertown, Pa. June. _W. Herbst._

Closely related to Russula depallens, from which it differs in having
the margin of the pileus striate at first and more strongly so when
mature, also in the pileus being spotted at first, the gills more
distant, the stem persistently white and the spores white. Bull. Torrey
Bot. Club. Vol. 23, No. 10. October, 1896.

I do not doubt its edibility. See R. depallens.


=R. ochrophyl´la= Pk.—_ochra_, a yellow earth; _phyllon_, a leaf.
=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, firm, convex becoming nearly plane or slightly
depressed in the center, even or rarely very slightly striate on the
margin when old, purple or dark purplish red. =Flesh= white, purplish
under the adnate cuticle, taste mild. =Gills= entire, a few of them
forked at the base, subdistant, adnate, at first yellowish, becoming
bright ochraceous buff when mature, dusted by the spores, the
interspaces somewhat venose. =Stem= equal or nearly so, solid or spongy
within, reddish or rosy tinted, paler than the pileus. =Spores= bright
ochraceous buff, globose-verruculose, 10µ broad.

The ochery-gilled Russula is a large fine species, but not a common one.
It differs but little in color and size from the European pungent
Russula, Russula drimeia, but it is easily distinguished from it by its
mild taste.

The cap is dry, convex or a little depressed in the center, purple or
purplish red, the white flesh purplish under the cuticle, which,
however, is not easily separable.

The gills are nearly all entire, extending from the stem to the margin
of the cap. They are therefore much closer together near the stem than
at the margin. They are at first yellowish, but a bright ochraceous buff
when mature. They are then dusted by the similarly colored spores.

The stem is stout, nearly cylindric, firm but spongy in the center and
colored like the cap, but generally a little paler. There is a variety
in which the stem is white and the cap deep red. In other respects it is
like the typical form. Its name is Russula ochrophylla albipes.

The ochery-gilled Russula grows in groups under trees, especially oak
trees, and should be sought in July and August. _Peck_, 51st Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, July to September, _McIlvaine_.

Edible. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

RI’GIDÆ.

=R. lac’tea= Fr.—_lac_, milk. =Pileus= 2 in. broad, at the first
_milk-white, then tan-white, throughout compactly fleshy_, bell-shaped,
then convex, often excentric, without a pellicle, always dry, at the
first even, then slightly cracked when dry, margin straight, thin,
obtuse, even. =Flesh= compact, white. =Stem= 1½-2 in. long, 1½ in.
thick, solid, very compact, but at length spongy-soft within, equal,
even, always white. =Gills= _free_, very broad, _thick, distant_, rigid,
forked, white. _Fries._

=Spores= subglobose, echinulate, 7–9µ _Massee_.

Closely allied to R. albella Pk. from which it differs in its shorter
stem, and pileus cracking into areolæ, and gills not being entire.

In mixed woods, in patches, not common.

Botanic creek, West Philadelphia, Pa., patches, _McIlvaine_, 1887.

Edible and of good flavor. _Macadam._

Raw, it has a raw, rather unpleasant taste and odor, a little like some
acorns. But its firm, thick flesh, meaty gills and stem, and good flavor
when well cooked, rank it equal to any.

=R. albel’la= Pk.—whitish. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, thin, fragile, dry,
plane or slightly depressed in the center, even or obscurely striate on
the margin, commonly white, sometimes tinged with pink or rosy-red,
especially on the margin. =Flesh= white, taste mild. =Lamellæ= entire,
white, becoming dusted by the spores. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 3–4 lines
thick, equal, solid or spongy within, white.

=Spores= white, globose, 7.6µ broad.

Dry soil of frondose woods. Port Jefferson. July.

Closely allied to R. lactea, but differing in its fragile texture,
entire lamellæ, more slender stem, and in the pileus not cracking into
areas. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=R. vires’cens= Fr.—_viresco_, to be green. (Plate XLIV, fig. 6, p.
184.) =Pileus= green, compactly fleshy, globose then expanded, at length
depressed, often unequal, always dry, not furnished with a pellicle,
wherefore the _flocculose cuticle is broken up into patches or warts_,
margin straight, obtuse, _even_. =Flesh= white, not very compact. =Stem=
solid, internally spongy, firm, _somewhat rivulose_, white. =Gills=
free, somewhat crowded, sometimes equal, sometimes forked, with a few
shorter ones intermixed, _white_. _Fries._

Taste mild; good, raw.

=Spores= scarcely echinulate, almost globular, 6µ _W.G.S._ =Spores=
8–10µ _Massee_; 6–7.6µ _Peck_.

=Cap= round when young, very hard, then convex or becoming dished,
sometimes repand. It is without a separable skin, covered with various
sized areas of mouldy looking patches which are at times distinctly
cracked. The color varies from a bright bluish-green to grayish-green,
such shades remind one of mouldy cheese or the shades of Roquefort;
again the color may vary in shades of light leather brown, occasionally
the caps are almost white, opaque in each shade of color. Flesh crisp,
brittle, thick, white, mild, good raw. Gills and stem as described.

R. virescens is common in the United States but not generally plentiful.
It is a solitary grower, usually but few are found in a patch. Striking
in appearance when its green colors are present, and always clean
looking and inviting. It sometimes attains the size of 5 in. across. It
is a hot weather Russula and rarely appears before the latter part of
June, then after rains.

To eat, it should be in a healthy, fresh condition. All Russulæ impart a
stale flavor if any part of gills or cap is wilting, drying or decaying.
It requires forty minutes' slow stewing, or it can be dressed raw as a
salad. Roasted or fried crisp in a hot buttered pan it is at its best.
It should be well salted.


=R. lep´ida= Fr.—_lepidus_, neat, elegant. =Pileus= 3 in. broad,
_blood-red-rose_, becoming pale, whitish especially at the disk,
somewhat equally fleshy, convex then expanded, scarcely depressed,
obtuse, opaque, unpolished, _with a silky appearance, at length often
cracked scaly_, margin spreading, obtuse, without striæ. =Stem= as much
as 3 in. long, often 1 in. thick, _even, white or rose-color_. =Gills=
rounded behind, rather thick, somewhat crowded, often forked, connected
by veins, white, often red at the edge.

Taste mild; wholly compact and firm, but the flesh is cheesy, not
somewhat clotted. The gills are often red at the edge, chiefly toward
the margin, on account of the margin of the pileus being continuous with
the gills. _Fries._

=Spores= 8–10×6–8µ _Syll._

Frequent. July to October, in mixed woods.

A common and variable species in size and color, but the cap is always
some shade of rose-red or lake. The flesh is compact and cheesy. The
gills sometimes edged with pink as they near the margin. Taste mild.

The crisp flesh of R. lepida requires forty minutes' slow stewing, if
stewed. It yields a delicate pink shade to the dish. Roasted or cooked
in a hot buttered pan it is excellent.


=R. ru´bra= Fr.—_ruber_, red. =Pileus= unicolorous, a
cinnabar-vermilion, but becoming pale (tan) when old, disk commonly
darker, compact, hard but fragile, convex, then flattened, here and
there depressed, absolutely dry, _without a pellicle, but becoming
polished-even_, often sinuously cracked when old, margin spreading,
obtuse, even, always persistent. =Flesh= white, _reddish under the
cuticle_. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, about 1 in. thick, solid, even, varying
white and red. =Gills= obtusely adnate, somewhat crowded, whitish, then
yellowish, with dimidiate and forked ones intermixed.

Very _acrid_, very hard and rigid, most distinct from all the others of
this group in the _pileus becoming polished-even_, although without a
pellicle, in the _flesh being somewhat clotted_, and in the _very acrid
taste_. =Gills= often red at the edge. _Fries._

=Spores= whitish, _Fries_; spheroid, 8–10µ _K._

Krapp says he has experienced grave inconveniences from eating it.
European authorities mark “poisonous.”

I do not hesitate to cook it either by itself or with other Russulæ and
serve it at my table. It is easier cooked than R. virescens and others
of the crisp species, and has equal flavor.

=R. Linnæ´i= Fr.—in honor of Linnæus. =Pileus= 3–4 in. broad,
unicolorous, dark purple, blood-red or bright rose, opaque, not becoming
pale, everywhere fleshy, rigid, plano-depressed, sometimes spread
upward, even, smooth, _dry, without a separable pellicle_, margin
spreading, obtuse, without striæ. =Flesh= thick, _spongy-compact,
white_. =Stem= 1½ in. and more long, 1 in. and more thick, stout, firm,
but spongy-soft within, somewhat ventricose, _obsoletely reticulated_
with fibers, intensely blood-red. =Gills= _adnate, somewhat decurrent_,
rather thick, not crowded, _broad_ (more than ½ in.), fragile, sparingly
connected by veins, white, becoming yellow when dry, with a few
dimidiate ones intermixed, somewhat anastomosing behind. _Fries._

=Spores= wholly white, _Fries_; ellipsoid, spheroid, echinulate, 11µ
_Q._; 9–11×8–9µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, 1881–1885. West Philadelphia, Pa., on Bartram’s Botanic
creek. _McIlvaine._

R. Linnæi is one of our handsomest and best Russulæ. European authors
state its habit to be exactly that of R. emetica, but though I have
known it intimately for many years I have not been struck with this in
the American plant. Its large size, its more or less red stem never
entirely white, at times hollow, cavernous, its less solid flesh, habit
of growing in troops, sometimes parts of rings, flourishing best where
the leaf mat is heaviest, loving the leaf drift in fence-corners, are
well marked distinctions.

When young there is no better Russula. As it ages the stem becomes soft,
spongy and should be thrown away. The caps, only, eaten.


=R. oliva´cea= Fr.—_oliva_, an olive; _olivaceus_, the color of an
olive. =Pileus= 2–4 in. across, dingy-purple then olivaceous or wholly
brownish-olivaceous, fleshy, convexo-flattened and depressed, _slightly
silky and squamulose_, margin spreading, even. =Flesh= _white, becoming
somewhat yellow_. =Stem= firm, ventricose, rose-color to pallid,
spongy-stuffed within. =Gills= adnexed, wide, _yellow_, with shorter and
forked ones intermixed.

Mild. Near to R. rubra, but certainly distinct in the stem being
definitely spongy, in the pileus being unpolished, and in the gills
being soft and brightly colored; corresponding with R. alutacea.
_Fries._

=Spores= light yellow, _Fries_; spheroid, punctate, 10µ _Q._; globose,
minutely granulate, yellow, 9–10µ diameter _Massee_.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1897–1898.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. across, 2–3 in. long, ½-⅓ in. thick.

The caps are equally good with R. alutacea. They must be fresh, and
similarly cooked.


=R. fla´vida= Frost—yellow. (Plate XLIV, fig. 3, p. 184.) =Pileus=
fleshy, convex, slightly depressed, unpolished, bright yellow. =Gills=
white, adnate, turning cinereous. =Stem= yellow, solid, white at the
extreme apex. _Frost_ Ms.

=Pileus= fleshy, convex, slightly depressed in the center, not polished,
yellow, the margin at first even, then slightly striate-tuberculate.
=Gills= nearly entire, venose-connected, white, then cinereous or
yellowish. =Stem= firm, solid, yellow, sometimes white at the top.

=Spores= yellow, subglobose, 6.5–7.6µ in diameter. =Flesh= white, taste
mild.

=Plant= 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 4–6 lines thick.
_Frost_ Mss.

Ground in woods. Sandlake. August. _Peck_, 32d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

R. flavida is showy, solitary and in patches. The stem when young and
solid is equally good with the cap. Cooks in twenty-five minutes and is
of good flavor.


                             HETEROPHYL´LÆ.


=R. ves´ca= Fr.—_vesco_, to feed. =Pileus= _red-flesh-color, disk
darker_, fleshy, slightly firm, plano-depressed, _slightly wrinkled with
veins_, with a viscid pellicle, margin at length spreading. =Flesh=
cheesy, firm, shining white. =Stem= _solid_, compact, externally rigid,
_reticulated and wrinkled_ in a peculiar manner, often attenuated at the
base, shining white. =Gills= adnate, crowded, thin, shining white, with
many unequal and forked ones intermixed, but scarcely connected by
veins.

Of middle stature. _Taste mild_, pleasant. _Fries._

=Spores= globose, echinulate, white, 9–10µ diameter. _Massee_.

In mixed woods. Common. August to frost.

R. vesca is frequent in woods or margins, and under trees in the open.
It is especially fond of growing in the grass under lone chestnut trees.
The caps seldom exceed 2-½ in. across.

It is one of the best.


=R. cyanoxan´tha= (Schaeff.) Fr. _Gr_—blue; _Gr_—yellow. (From the
colors.) (Plate XLIV, fig. 1, p. 184.) =Pileus= 2–3 in. and more broad,
_lilac or purplish then olivaceous-green_, disk commonly becoming pale
often yellowish, _margin_ commonly becoming _azure-blue or livid
purple_, compact, convex then plane, then depressed or infundibuliform,
sometimes even, sometimes wrinkled or streaked, viscous, margin deflexed
then expanded, remotely and slightly striate. =Flesh= firm, cheesy,
white, commonly reddish beneath the separable pellicle. =Stem= 2–3 in.
long, as much as 1 in. thick, _spongy-stuffed_, but firm, often
cavernous within when old, equal, smooth, _even_, shining white. =Gills=
rounded behind, connected by veins, not much crowded, broad, forked with
shorter ones intermixed, shining white.

Allied to R. vesca in its _mild_, pleasant _taste_ and in other
respects, but constantly different in the color of the pileus, which is
very variable, whereas in R. vesca it is unchangeable. The peculiar
combination of colors in the pileus, though very variable, always
readily distinguishes it. _Fries._

=Spores= 8–9µ, cystidia numerous, pointed, _Massee_; 8–10×6–8µ _Sacc._

In mixed woods. Common. August to October.

Pronounced one of the best esculent species by all authorities.


=R. heterophyl´la= Fr. _Gr_—differing; _Gr_—a leaf. (Gills differing in
length.) =Pileus= very variable in color, but _never becoming reddish or
purple_, fleshy, firm, convexo-plane then depressed, _even, polished_,
the very thin pellicle disappearing, margin thin, even or densely but
slightly striate. =Flesh= white. =Stem= solid, firm, somewhat equal,
_even_, shining white. =Gills= _reaching the stem in an attenuated form,
very narrow, very crowded_, forked and dimidiate, shining white.

Taste _always mild_, as in R. cyanoxantha, from which it differs in its
smaller stature, in the pileus being thinner, even, _never reddish_ or
purplish, with a thin closely adnate pellicle, in the _stem being firm
and solid_, and in the _gills_ being _thin, very narrow, very crowded_,
etc. The apex of the stem is occasionally dilated in the form of a cup,
so that the gills appear remote. _Fries._

=Spores= echinulate, 5×7µ _W.G.S._; 7–8µ diameter _Massee_.

Common. Woods. July to November.

Edible, of a sweet nutty flavor. _Stevenson._

R. heterophylla is very common. Its smooth, even pileus, colored in some
dingy shade of green, distinguishes it. It is much infested by grubs.
Specimens for the table should be young and fresh. Wilted specimens are
unpleasant.

=R. f[oe]´tens= Fr.—_f[oe]tens_, stinking. =Pileus= 4–5 in. and more
broad, dingy yellow, often becoming pale, thinly fleshy, at first
bullate, then expanded and depressed, covered with a pellicle which is
adnate, not separable, and viscid in wet weather, margin broadly
membranaceous, at the first bent inward _with ribs which are at length
tubercular_. =Flesh= thin, _rigid_-fragile, pallid. =Stem= 2 in. and
more long, ½-1 in. thick, stout, stuffed then hollow, whitish. =Gills=
adnexed, crowded, connected by veins, with very many _dimidiate and
forked_ ones intermixed, whitish, at the first _exuding watery drops_.

_Fetid._ _Taste acrid._ Very _rigid_, most distinct from all others in
_its very heavy empyreumatic_ odor. In very dry weather the odor is
often obsolete. The margin is more broadly membranaceous and hence
marked with _longer furrows_ than in any other species. It differs from
all the preceding ones in the gills at the first exuding watery drops.
The gills become obsoletely light yellow, and dingy when bruised.
_Fries._

=Pileus= fleshy, with a wide thin margin, hemispherical or convex, then
expanded or depressed, viscid when moist, widely striate-tuberculate on
the margin, dull pale yellow or straw color. =Lamellæ= rather broad,
close, venose-connected, some of them forked, whitish. =Stipe= nearly
cylindrical, whitish, hollow. =Spores= white. =Plant= sometimes
cespitose.

=Height= 2–4 in.; breadth of pileus 2–3 in. =Stipe= 4–6 lines thick.

Pine woods. West Albany. October.

=Taste= mild at first, then slightly disagreeable. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

=Spores= minute, echinulate, almost globular, 8µ _W.G.S._; 8–10µ
_Massee_.

In woods. Common. July to October.

Var. _granula´ta_ has the pileus rough with small granular scales.
_Peck_, Rep. 39.

A very coarse and easily recognized species. Reckoned poisonous, though
eaten by slugs. _W.G.S._

The verdict is against it. Both smell and taste are usually unpleasant.
Cooked it retains its flavor, more closely resembling wild cherry bark
than anything else. On two occasions I ate enough to convince me that it
was not poisonous.


=R. el´egans= Bresad.—_elegans_, pretty. Mild at first, becoming acrid
with age. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across. =Flesh= rather thick; convex then
depressed; margin tuberculose and striate when old, viscid, bright rosy
flesh-color, soon ochraceous at the circumference, everywhere densely
granulated. =Gills= adnexed or slightly rounded, narrow behind, very
much crowded, equal, rarely forked, whitish, becoming either entirely or
here and there ochraceous-orange. =Stem= 1½-2 in. long, 5–7 lines thick,
a little thickened at the base, rather rugulose, white, base ochraceous.
=Flesh= white, turning ochraceous and acrid when old.

=Spores= 8–10µ diameter _Massee_.

Allied to R. vesca. Known by the bright rose-colored, densely granular
pileus and tuberculose margin. When old the pileus is almost entirely
ochraceous. _Massee._

Frequent in the West Virginia forests, 1881–1885. Chester county, Pa.,
1887–1890. In mixed woods. July to September. _McIlvaine._

It differs from R. vesca in its cap being minutely granulated instead of
streaked, and in becoming acrid with age.

The caps are of good quality, needing to be well cooked.


                               FRA´GILES.

* _Gills and spores white._


=R. eme´tica= Fr.—an emetic. (Plate XLIV, fig. 2, p. 184.) =Pileus= 3–4
in. broad, at first rosy then _blood-color_, tawny when old, sometimes
becoming yellow and at length (in moist places) white, at first
bell-shaped then flattened or depressed, polished, _margin_ at length
_furrowed and tubercular_. =Flesh= _white, reddish under the separable
pellicle_. =Stem= spongy-stuffed, stout, elastic when young, fragile
when older, even, white or reddish. =Gills= somewhat _free_, broad,
somewhat distant, shining white.

Handsome, regular, moderately firm, but fragile when full grown, _taste_
very _acrid_. _Fries._

=Spores= shining white, _Fries_; spheroid, echinulate, 8–10µ _K._; 7µ
_W.G.S._

Maryland, _Miss Banning_; New York, _Peck_, Rep. 22; Indiana, Illinois,
_H.I. Miller_.

Said to act as its name implies as an emetic. Certainly poisonous.
_Stevenson._

Krapp says he has himself experienced rare inconveniences from eating
it. Preferred to others in Indiana and Illinois. _H.I. Miller_, 1898.

The varying reports upon R. emetica are quoted above. In 1881, in the
West Virginia mountains, I began testing this Russula and soon found
that it was harmless. At least twenty persons ate it in quantity, during
its season, for four years. Yet, in my many published articles, I
continued, out of regard for the opinions of others and in excess of
caution, to warn against all bitter and peppery fungi. But from that
time until the present I have eaten it, and I have made special effort
to establish its innocence by getting numbers of my friendly helpers to
eat it.

It was suggested by one of its prosecutors that perhaps I was mistaking
another fungus for it. In October, 1898, I sent to Professor Peck a lot
of the Russula I was eating. He wrote: “It seems to be R. emetica as you
state. It certainly is hot enough for it.”


=R. pectina´ta= Fr.—_pecten_, a comb. =Pileus= 3 in. broad, at first
gluey, _toast-brown_, then dry, becoming pale, tan, with the _disk_
always _darker_, fleshy, _rigid_, convex then flattened and depressed or
concavo-infundibuliform (basin-shaped); margin thin, _pectinato-sulcate_
(deeply ribbed), here and there irregularly shaped. =Flesh= _white,
light yellowish under the pellicle_, which is not easily separable.
=Stem= curt, 3 in. long, ¾–1 in. thick, _rigid_, spongy-stuffed,
longitudinally _slightly striate, shining white_, often attenuated at
the base. =Gills= _attenuato-free_ behind, broader toward the margin,
somewhat crowded, _equal_, simple, white.

Odor weak, but nauseous, approaching that of R. f[oe]tens. _Fries._

=Spores= 8–9µ diameter _Massee_.

New York, _Peck_, 43d Rep. West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey.
Common in woods, grassy, mossy places. July to frost. _McIlvaine._

Named from the furrows of the margin being like the teeth of a comb.

Both the appearance and smell of this Russula will detect it. The
peculiar comb-like furrows of its margin, viscid or varnished-looking
cap, and strong but more spicy smell than cherry-bark are noticeable.

It is edible, but so strong in flavor that a piece of one will spoil a
dish if cooked with other kinds.


=R. ochroleu´ca= Fr. _Gr_—pale yellow; _Gr_—white. =Pileus= _yellow,
becoming pale_, fleshy, flattened or depressed, polished, with an adnate
pellicle, the spreading margin _becoming even_. =Stem= spongy, stuffed,
firm, _slightly reticulato-wrinkled, white, becoming cinereous_. =Gills=
_rounded behind_, united, broad, _somewhat equal_, white becoming pale.

Odor obsolete, but pleasant. The pileus is never reddish. It agrees
wholly with R. emetica in structure and stature, as well as in the
_acrid taste_; it differs however in the stem being slightly
recticulato-wrinkled, white becoming cinereous, in the adnate pellicle
of the pileus, in the margin remaining for a long time _even_ (remotely
striate, but not tubercular, only when old), and in the gills being
rounded behind and becoming pale. The color of the pileus is constant.
The gills remain _free_ and do not exude drops. _Fries._

=Cap= 2–4 in. across. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, up to ¾ in. thick.

=Spores= papillose, 7µ _W.G.S._, 8×9µ _Massee_.

Frequent in woods. July to October.

Not as common as R. emetica, yet frequently found, usually solitary, at
times gregarious. It is quite peppery, but loses pepperiness in cooking.
Myself and others have frequently eaten it.


=R. ci´trina= Gillet—_citrina_, citron colored. =Mild.= =Pileus= 2–3 in.
across, slightly fleshy at the disk, margin thin; convex then more or
less expanded and slightly depressed, rather viscid when moist, smooth,
slightly wrinkled at the margin when old, bright lemon-yellow, color
usually uniform, sometimes paler at the margin, occasionally with a
greenish tint, center of pileus at length becoming pale-ochraceous;
pellicle separable. =Gills= slightly decurrent, broadest a short
distance from the margin, and gradually becoming narrower towards the
base, forked at the base and also sometimes near the middle, white, 1½
lines deep at broadest part. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, about 4 lines thick,
equal or slightly narrowed at the base, slightly wrinkled, straight or
very slightly waved, solid.

=Spores= subglobose, echinulate, 8µ diameter.

In woods.

Known by the clear lemon-yellow or citron-colored pileus and the
persistently white gills and stem. The taste is mild at first, but
becomes slightly acrid if kept in the mouth for a short time. _Massee._

R. citrina can hardly be classed among the acrid species. The taste is
slightly of cherry-bark and disappears in cooking. It is usually found
in patches which contain ten to twenty individuals. It is a species of
fair quality.


=R. fra´gilis= Fr.—fragile. =Pileus= 1–1½ in. broad, rarely more,
flesh-color, changing color, very thin, fleshy only at the disk, at the
first convex and often umbonate, then plane and depressed, pellicle
thin, becoming pale, slightly viscid in wet weather; _margin_ very thin,
_tuberculoso-striate_. =Stem= 1½-2 in. long, spongy within, soon hollow,
often slightly striate, white. =Gills= slightly adnexed, very _thin,
crowded_, broad, _ventricose_, all equal, shining white. _Fries._

Very acrid. Smaller and more fragile than the rest of the group,
directly changing color. The color is variable, often opaque, typically
flesh-color, when changed in color white externally and internally,
often with reddish spots. Among varieties of color is to be noted a
livid flesh-colored form, with the disk becoming fuscous.

It is not easy to define it from fragile forms of R. emetica, but the
gills are much more crowded, thinner, and often slightly eroded at the
edge, ventricose; the pileus thinner and more lax, etc. _Stevenson._

Var. _nivea_ Fr.—_nivea_, snowy. Whole plant white.

=Spores= minutely echinulate 8–10×8µ _Massee_.

Though one of the peppery kind, I have not, after fifteen years of
eating it, had reason to question its edibility. The caps are not meaty,
but what there is of them is good.


=R. puncta´ta= Gillet—_punctata_, dotted. =Mild.= =Pileus= 1½-2½ in.
across. =Flesh= thin, white, reddish under the cuticle; convex then
flattened, viscid, rosy, disk darkest, punctate with dark reddish
point-like warts, pale when old; margin striate. =Gills= slightly
adnexed, 2 lines broad, white then yellowish, edge often reddish. =Stem=
about 1 in. long, 4–5 lines thick, attenuated and whitish at the base,
remainder colored like the pileus, stuffed.

=Spores= 8–9µ diameter _Massee_.

Among grass.

Edible. Boston Myc. Club Bull. 1896.


      ** _Gills and spores white then yellowish or bright lemon._


=R. in´tegra= Fr.—_integer_, entire, whole. =Pileus= 4–5 in. across,
typically red, changing color, fleshy, campanulato-convex then expanded
and depressed, fragile when full-grown, with a gluey pellicle, at length
_furrowed and somewhat tubercular_ at the margin. =Flesh= _white_,
sometimes yellowish above. =Stem= at first short, conical, then
club-shaped or _ventricose_, as much as 3 in. long, up to 1 in. thick,
spongy-stuffed, commonly stout, _even_, shining _white_. =Gills=
somewhat free, very broad, up to ¾ in., equal or bifid at the stem,
somewhat distant, connected by veins, pallid-white, at length light
yellow, _somewhat powdered yellow with the spores_.

_Taste mild_, often astringent. The most changeable of all species,
especially in the color of the pileus which is typically red, but at the
same time inclining to azure-blue, bay-brown, olivaceous, etc. Sometimes
the gills are sterile and remain white. _Fries._

=Spores= ellipsoid-spheroid or spheroid echinulate, globose, rough, 8–9µ
_C.B.P._; 9–10µ diameter, pale ochraceous. _Massee._

It is difficult to separate R. integra from R. alutacea. The spores
usually show upon the gills as pale dull yellow powder. It is of equal
excellence.


=R. decolo´rans= Fr.—_de_ and _coloro_, to color. =Pileus= 3–5 in.
broad, color various, at first orange-red, then light yellow and
becoming pale, fleshy, spherical then expanded and depressed, remarkably
regular, viscid when moist, thin and at length striate at the margin.
=Flesh= _white, but becoming somewhat cinereous_ when broken, and more
or less _variegated with black spots_ when old. =Stem= _elongated_, 3–5
in., cylindrical, solid, but spongy within, often _wrinkled-striate,
white then becoming cinereous_ especially within. =Gills= adnexed, often
in pairs, thin, crowded, fragile, white then yellowish.

_Taste mild._ Colors changeable according to a fixed rule, but not
variable. The gills are not ochraceous-pulverulent as in R. integra, nor
shining and pure yellow as in R. aurata, etc. _Fries._

=Spores= yellow, 8.3µ _Morgan_.

New York, _Peck_, 23d Rep. Angora, West Philadelphia, Pa., 1897, in
mixed woods. August to October. _McIlvaine._

Esculent and of good quality. _Morgan._

Meals of it make one regret its scarcity.


=R. basifurca´ta= Pk.—forked near stem. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, firm,
convex, umbilicate, becoming somewhat funnel form, glabrous, slightly
viscid when moist, the thin pellicle scarcely separable except on the
margin, dingy-white, sometimes tinged with yellow or reddish-yellow, the
margin nearly even. =Lamellæ= rather close, narrowed toward the base,
adnate or slightly emarginate, many of them forked near the base, a few
short ones intermingled, white becoming yellowish. =Stem= 8–12 lines
long, 5–6 lines thick, firm, solid, becoming spongy within, white.

=Spores= elliptical, pale yellow, uninucleate or shining, 9×6.5µ.
=Flesh= white, taste mild, then bitterish.

Dry hard ground in paths and wood roads. Canoga, N.Y. July.

This species closely resembles pale forms of R. furcata, from which it
is separated by the absence of any silky micor and by the yellowish
color and elliptical shape of the spores and by the yellowish hue of the
lamellæ. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., September, 1898, to frost. Gravelly ground. Solitary.
Gills adnate. Identified as his species by Professor Peck.

The slight bitterish taste disappears in cooking. It is edible and of
fair quality.


=R. aura´ta= Fr.—_aurum_, gold. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, varying
_lemon-yellow, orange and red_, disk darker, fleshy, _rigid_, brittle
however, hemispherical then plane, disk not depressed, pellicle thin,
adnate, viscid in wet weather, _margin even_, and slightly striate only
when old, but sometimes wrinkled. =Flesh= _lemon-yellow_ under the
pellicle, white below. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, solid, _firm_, but spongy
within, cylindrical, obsoletely striate, white or lemon-yellow. =Gills=
rounded free, connected by veins, broad, equal, shining, never
pulverulent, whitish inclining to light yellow, but vivid _lemon-yellow
at the edge_. _Fries._

West Virginia, 1881–1885; Pennsylvania, 1887–1898. In woods under pines.
July to October. _McIlvaine._

Pileus sometimes depressed in center, very viscid when wet.

A troop of this Russula upon brown wood mat is a pretty sight. Its rich
and brightly-colored cap attracts the eye from a distance. The yellow
edge of its gills is the distinctive mark of the species.

The smell is pleasant, the taste slightly of cherry bark.

Cooked it is one of the best Russulæ.


=R. atropurpu´rea= Pk.—_atre_, black; _purpureus_, purple. Dark purple
Russula. =Pileus= 3–4 in. broad, at first convex, then centrally
depressed, glabrous, dark purple, blackish in the center, the margin
even or slightly striate. =Flesh= white, grayish or grayish-purple under
the separable pellicle, taste mild, odor of the drying plant fetid, very
unpleasant. =Lamellæ= nearly equal, subdistant, sometimes forked near
the stem, at first white, then yellowish, becoming brownish where
bruised. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 5–8 lines thick, equal, glabrous, spongy
within, white, brownish where bruised. =Spores= subglobose, minutely
rough, pale ochraceous with a salmon tint, 8–10µ.

Open woods. Gansevoort. July.

In color this species resembles R. variata, but in other respects it is
very different. It is very distinct in the peculiar color of its spores,
and in the brownish hue assumed by wounds. _Peck_, 41st Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

West Philadelphia, Pa. July, 1897. Open woods. Solitary. Philadelphia
Myc. Center.

Many were eaten and enjoyed. Only fresh plants are acceptable, and they
should be cooked as soon as gathered. Even in wilting they become
unpleasant.


                   *** _Gills and spores ochraceous._


=R. aluta´cea= Fr.—_aluta_, tanned leather. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad,
commonly bright blood-color or _red_, even black-purple, but becoming
pale, especially at the disk, fleshy, bell-shaped then convex, flattened
and somewhat umbilicate, even, _with a remarkably sticky pellicle,
margin thin, at length striate, tubercular_. =Flesh= _snow-white_.
=Stem= 2 in. long, solid, stout, equal, even, white, most frequently
_variegated-reddish_, even purple. =Gills= at first free, _thick, very
broad_, connected by veins, all equal, somewhat distant, at first pallid
light yellow, then bright ochraceous, not pulverulent.

It is distinguished from R. integra by its gills not being pulverulent.
_Fries._

=Spores= yellow 7–9µ _Massee_; 11–14×8–10µ _Sacc._, _Syll_.

July to frost. _McIlvaine._

R. alutacea is easily recognized among Russulæ by its mild taste and
broad yellow gills. In young specimens one sometimes has to look at the
gills at an angle to detect the yellow. It is quite common but a
solitary grower. It is everywhere eaten as a favorite. Only fresh plants
yield a good flavor. When the stem is soft, it should be thrown away.


=R. puella´ris= Fr. (Plate XLIV, fig. 7, p. 184.) =Mild.= =Pileus= 1–1½
in. across, flesh almost membranaceous except the disk; conico-convex
then expanded, at first rather gibbous, then slightly depressed,
scarcely viscid, color peculiar, purplish-livid then yellowish, disk
always darker and brownish; tuberculosely striate, often to the middle.
=Gills= adnate but very much narrowed behind, thin, crowded, white then
pale-yellow, not shining nor powdered with the spores. =Stem= 1–1½ in.
long, 2–4 lines thick, equal, soft, fragile, wrinkled under a lens,
white or yellowish; stuffed, soon hollow; taste mild.

=Spores= subglobose, pale-yellow, echinulate, 10×8–9µ _Massee_.

In woods.

Among the most frequent and readily recognized of species, occurring in
troops. Always small, thin, taste mild. Allied to R. nitida, but more
slender; color paler, and not shining. _Fries._

Distinguished from R. nitida and R. nauseosa by the absence of smell.
_Massee._

Var. _inten´sior_ Cke. Nearly the same size as the typical form; pileus
deep purple, nearly black at the disk.

The stem has a tendency to become thickened at the base, and turns
yellowish when touched.

Var. _rose´ipes_ Sec., given by Massee, has been retained as a distinct
species by Professor Peck, Rep. 51, and is described in place. R.
pusilla Pk., 50th Rep., is closely allied to it.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina. Common in woods
and under trees in short grass. July to September. _McIlvaine._

This little Russula is ubiquitous. It does not amount to much when other
fungi are plenty, because of its very thin cap, but it thrives in all
sorts of summer weather. When its companions are scarce or parched R.
puellaris is gladly gathered by the mycophagist, its numbers making up
for its lightness and lack of flavor.


=R. pusil´la= Pk.—little. =Pileus= very thin, nearly plane or slightly
and umbilicately depressed in the center, glabrous, slightly striate on
the margin, red, sometimes a little darker in the center, the thin
pellicle separable. =Flesh= white, taste mild. =Lamellæ= broad for the
size of the plant, subventricose, subdistant, adnate or slightly rounded
behind, white, becoming yellowish-ochraceous in drying. =Stem= short,
soft, solid or spongy within, white.

=Spores= faintly tinged with yellow, 7.6µ broad.

=Pileus= scarcely 1 in. broad. =Stem= 6–12 lines long, 2–3 lines thick.

Bare ground in thin woods. Port Jefferson. July.

The coloring matter of the pileus may be rubbed upon paper and produce
on it red stains if the surface is previously moistened with water or
dilute alcohol. This is one of the smallest Russulas known to me. The
pileus was less than an inch broad and the stem less than an inch long
in all the specimens seen by me. The species is closely allied to R.
puellaris, and especially resembles the variety intensior in color. It
differs in its smaller size, even or but slightly striate margin, broad
lamellæ and in the stem or flesh not becoming yellowish spotted where
touched. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, 1881–1885. Pennsylvania, 1896–1897. July to September.
_McIlvaine._

It makes up in quality what it lacks in quantity.


=R. rose´ipes= (Secr.) Bres.—_rosa_, a rose; _pes_, a foot. (Plate XLIV,
fig. 5, p. 184.) =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad, convex becoming nearly plane or
slightly depressed, at first viscid, soon dry, becoming slightly striate
on the thin margin, rosy-red variously modified by pink orange or
ochraceous hues, sometimes becoming paler with age, taste mild. =Gills=
moderately close, nearly entire, rounded behind and slightly adnexed,
ventricose, whitish becoming yellow. =Stem= 1½-3 in. long, 3–4 lines
thick, slightly tapering upward, stuffed or somewhat cavernous, white
tinged with red.

=Spores= yellow, globose or subglobose.

The plants grow in woods of pine and hemlock and have been collected in
July and August. The flesh is tender and agreeable in flavor. _Peck_,
51st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= globose, minutely echinulate, pale ochraceous, 8–10µ diameter
_Massee_.

R. roseipes is common in West Virginia under hemlocks and spruces. At
Mt. Gretna, Pa., it grew sparingly under pines. It is excellent.


=R. Ma´riæ= Pk. =Pileus= fleshy, convex, subumbilicate, at length
expanded and centrally depressed, minutely pulverulent, bright pink-red
(crimson lake), the disk a little darker, margin even. =Lamellæ= rather
close, reaching the stem, some of them forked, venose-connected, white,
then yellowish. =Stem= equal, solid, colored like the pileus except the
extremities which are usually white. =Spores= globose, nearly smooth,
7.6µ in diameter; flesh of the pileus white, red under the cuticle,
taste mild.

=Plant= 2 in. high. =Pileus= 1.5–2 in. broad. Stem 3–6 lines thick. Dry
ground in woods. Catskill mountains. July.

The minute colored granules, which give the pileus a soft pruinose
appearance, are easily rubbed off on paper, and water put upon the fresh
specimens is colored by them. _Peck_, 24th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

New York, _Peck_, 24th and 50th Rep.; West Virginia, 1882–1885; Mt.
Gretna, Pa., solitary in mixed woods. July to September. 1897–1898.
_McIlvaine._

It is on a par with most Russulæ.


=R. ochra´cea= Fr.—_ochra_, a yellow earth. =Mild.= =Pileus= about 3 in.
across. =Flesh= rather thick at the center, becoming thin toward the
margin, pale ochraceous, soft; convex then expanded and depressed,
margin coarsely striate, pellicle thin, viscid, ochraceous with a tinge
of yellow, disk usually becoming darker. =Gills= slightly adnexed,
broad, scarcely crowded, ochraceous. =Stem= about 1½ in. long, 5–7 lines
thick, slightly wrinkled longitudinally, ochraceous, stuffed, soft.

=Spores= globose, echinulate, ochraceous, 10–12µ diameter.

In pine and mixed woods.

The mild taste and ochraceous color of every part, including the flesh,
separate the present from every other species.

Commonly confounded with Russula fellea, but known at once by its mild
taste. Agreeing most nearly with R. lutea in color, but differing in the
softer flesh, which becomes ochraceous upward; sulcate margin of the
pileus, and broader, less crowded gills. =Pileus= persistently
ochraceous, disk usually darker. =Stem= sometimes yellow, sometimes
white. _Fries._

North Carolina, borders of woods, _Curtis_; California, _Harkness and
Moore_.

Fries says that the flavor is mild, but Roze places it in the list of
suspected species, although he notes it as not acrid; it may be inferred
that he considers the flavor unpleasant. _Macadam._

“Like chicken,” not common. Boston Myc. Club Bull. 1896.


=R. lu´tea= (Huds.) Fr.—_luteus_, yellow. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad,
_yellow_, at length becoming pale, and occasionally wholly white, thinly
fleshy, soon convexo-plane or plano-depressed, sticky when moist, _even_
or when old obsoletely striate _at the margin_. =Flesh= white. =Stem= ½
in. long, 3–4 lines thick, stuffed then _hollow_, soft, fragile, equal,
even, white, never reddish. =Gills= somewhat free, connected by veins,
_crowded, narrow_, all equal, ochraceous-egg-yellow.

Always small, very regular, taste mild. _When young the pileus is always
of a beautiful yellow._ _Fries._

=Spores= yellow, echinulate, 8µ _W.G.S._; globose, rough, 6–7µ _C.B.P._;
8–10×7–8µ _Massee_.

Allied to R. vitellina, but differs in having the margin of the cap
even, and but little odor.

The plant I have so referred has the gills at first white and the stem
yellow like the pileus; it may be a new species. In beech woods,
_Morgan_; West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, in mixed woods, often
under beeches, August to November, _McIlvaine_.

The plants I have found have white gills when young (few species have
not), but rapidly become yellow. The stem is usually white when young,
and sometimes remains so, but often becomes more or less yellow.

It is a pretty species. The flavor is not as strong as in some species,
but is delicate.


=R. nauseo´sa= Fr. =Pileus= variable in color, typically _purplish at
the disk_, then livid, but becoming pale and often whitish, laxly
fleshy, thin, at first plano-gibbous, then depressed, viscid in wet
weather, _furrowed_ and somewhat tubercular at the somewhat
membranaceous _margin_. =Flesh= soft, white. =Stem= short, about 1 in.
long, 4 lines thick, spongy-stuffed, slightly striate, white. =Gills=
adnexed, ventricose, _somewhat distant_, here and there with a few
shorter ones intermixed, light yellow then dingy ochraceous.

The taste is mild, but also nauseous, as the odor often is. The habit is
that of R. nitida, of the same color of pileus, but differing in the
color of the gills. _Fries._

=Cap= about 2 in. across. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, ¼-½ in. thick.

=Spores= dingy yellow, 8–9µ diameter. _Massee._

North Carolina and Pennsylvania, _Schweinitz_; West Virginia,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, in pine and mixed woods. August to October.
_McIlvaine._

The odor and taste of R. nauseosa are misnamed, therefore the plant.
They are heavy at times, when the plant is wet or old, as is the case
with R. f[oe]tens, but they are always of cherry bark. Both odor and
taste disappear in cooking. The species is as good as any Russula of its
texture.


=R. vitelli´na= Fr.—_vitellus_, yolk of egg. =Pileus= 1 in. broad,
_uni-colorous_, light yellow then wholly pallid, somewhat membranaceous,
at length _tuberculoso-striate_, somewhat dry, disk very small, slightly
fleshy. =Stem= thin, scarcely exceeding 1 in. long, 2 lines thick,
equal. =Gills= separating-free, equal, _distant_, rather thick,
connected by veins, saffron-yellow.

Pretty, very fragile, strong-smelling, mild. _Fries._

=Spores= 7–8µ diameter _Massee_.

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, August to October. In pine and
mixed woods, July to October. Not common in number.

This pretty species has a cherry-bark taste and smell like R. f[oe]tens,
though not so offensively heavy. It is not poisonous. A small piece of
it will affect a whole dish of other Russulæ.


=R. chamæleonti´na= Fr.—changing color like a chamæleon. =Pileus= 1–2
in. broad, thinly fleshy, soon flattened, sometimes oblique with a thin,
separable, viscid pellicle, which is at first flesh-color, then
presently changing color, becoming yellow at the disk and at length
wholly yellow, margin even, then slightly striate. =Stem= as much as 3
in. long, but thin, somewhat hollow, slightly striate, white. =Gills=
more or less adnexed, _thin, crowded_, equal, narrow, somewhat forked,
light-yellow-ochraceous.

Mild, inodorous, very fragile. =Pileus= _rosy blood-red, purplish
lilac_, etc. Sometimes even at the first yellowish at the disk. _Fries._

=Spores= globose, ochraceous, 7–8µ diameter _Massee_.

In pine and in mixed woods. August to October. _McIlvaine._

The change in color of the cap which gives name to this species is not
remarkable. Most species of Russulæ are sensitive to light. An otherwise
highly colored cap will be almost white when a leaf adheres to it. If in
youth it grows under dense shade it will be very much lighter than if
where light is generous, and will remain so. If in growing it thrusts
itself out of shadow, its color will change and it will deepen. The
apparent rarity of R. chamæleontina I think due to the close observation
necessary to detect its changes in color, which, as I have found it, are
by no means constant. It is quite plentiful in the pines of southern New
Jersey, and at Mt. Gretna, Pa., it is frequently found.

It is a good esculent species.

a veil. _Fries._

[Illustration: CANTHARELLUS CIBARIUS.]

In Cantharellus the gills—vein-like and generally thick with an obtuse
edge—are entirely different from those of all the preceding genera. In
those they are thin, and distinct from the pileus and from each other.
In Hygrophorus the gills are frequently thick, but the edge is always
sharp. The species of Craterellus are funnel-shaped, resembling some of
those in Cantharellus, but are distinguished by their lack of evident
gills.

Monograph New York Species of Cantharellus, _Peck_, Bull. 1887.

The members of this genus are few, but they are choice. Of them is the
Cantharellus cibarius, of which Trattinik quaintly says: “Not only this
same fungus never did any one harm, but might even restore the dead.”

The writer first made its acquaintance when among the West Virginia
mountains in 1881. The golden patches of single and clustered cibarius,
fragrant as ripened apricots, tufting the short grass or mossy ground
under beeches, oaks and like-growing trees, through which the sunlight
filtered generously, were so tempting, that he determined there must be
luxury, even in death, from such toadstools.

Experiments made by the writer in West Virginia where the species grows
luxuriantly and is of much higher flavor than any he has found
elsewhere, prove that it is easy to transplant within congenial
habitats, either by the mycelium or spores. Nature, there, resorts to
washing masses of leaves containing the propagating parts of the fungus
along the depressions of the water-sheds, and it is found growing
plentifully where the wind has drifted forest leaves against trees,
brush, and fence-corners.

Other species of the genus do not, as a rule, grow so plentifully,
neither are they of equal excellence, but several of them are equal to
any other species. Suspicion has been thrown upon C. aurantiacus. There
is such a marked difference between the excellence of the genus in West
Virginia and other localities, that it is possible C. aurantiacus may be
noxious elsewhere, but the writer has not found it so; and it would be
an astonishing contradiction of Nature’s ways if it was.

Stevenson says: “It (C. cibarius) must have four hours slow cooking.”
The writer has found thirty minutes to be sufficient; and it will fry in
butter as quickly as any other fungus.

Wherever grown C. cibarius is one of the best. In European countries it
is highly rated, and is expensive. Its mode of growth varies with its
plentifulness. In the West Virginia mountains large patches of it
closely cover the ground. Clusters weighing ½ pound are frequent.

When shredded, or cut across the fibers, slow cooking for half an hour
is sufficient, if the plants are fresh. If gathered for some hours, they
should be soaked for a time.

Grows in the West Virginia mountains, along with C. cibarius, and
separate from it. It is more tender than C. cibarius, and not equal in
flavor to those found there. I usually cooked them together and thus got
quantity well flavored.


=C. auranti´acus= Fr.—orange-yellow. (Plate CXXXVI, fig. 4, p. 508.)
=Pileus= fleshy, obconic, nearly plane above, smooth or minutely
tomentose, dull orange with the disk usually brownish, the margin
decurved and sometimes yellowish. =Gills= narrow, close, repeatedly
forked, orange, sometimes yellowish. =Stem= inequal, generally tapering

Stevenson says of the English species, “Unpleasant, reckoned poisonous.”
The writer’s acquaintance with C. aurantiacus has been principally
confined to West Virginia. There its taste is mild, scent but little,
flavor not distinguishable from eastern C. Cibarius. There it is
perfectly safe and wholesome; neither have the writer and his friends
any reason for condemning it.


=C. umbona´tus= Fr.—having an umbo. =Pileus= 1 in. and more broad,
_ashy-blackish_, slightly fleshy, convex when young, _umbonate, at
length depressed_, even, dry, _flocculoso_-silky on the surface, shining
brightly especially under a lens. =Flesh= soft, white, often becoming
red when wounded. =Stem= 3 in. long, about 4 lines thick, _stuffed_,
equal, elastic, villous at the base, _ash-colored_, but paler than the
pileus. =Gills= decurrent, thin, tense and straight, _crowded_,
repeatedly divided by pairs, _shining-white_.

Odor and taste scarcely notable. Gregarious. Among the taller mosses the
stem is longer. Often overlooked from its habit being that of an agaric.
It varies with the pileus squamulose and blackish.

In woods. April to August. _Fries._

The rather prominent gills of this small species are likely to confuse
those not familiar with its variance from the genuine type. Reddish
tinge to flesh not noticed in the American species. The writer has
gathered it in several states and enjoyed it for many years.

=C. rosel´lus= Pk.—rosy. =Pileus= thin, funnel-shaped, regular,
glabrous, pale pinkish-red. =Flesh= white. =Gills= narrow, close,
dichotomous, deeply decurrent, whitish, tinged with pink. =Stem= equal,
slender, solid, subglabrous, often flexuous, colored like the pileus.
=Spores= minute, broadly elliptical, 3.5×2.5µ.

=Pileus= 4–8 lines broad. =Stem= about 1 in. long, scarcely 1 line
thick.

Mossy ground in groves of balsam. North Elba. September. This small
species belongs to the section Agaricoides, and is apparently closely
allied to C. albidus, from which its smaller size and different color
distinguish it. The pileus is sometimes deeply umbilicate. _Peck_, 42d
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Frequent in pine woods of New Jersey, near Haddonfield, where the plant
is sturdier than described. Though small it grows gregarious and in
troops from which appetizing quantities can be gathered.

It makes a pretty dish of pinkish hue and one of rare excellence.


=C. lutes´cens= Bull.—yellowish. (Plate CXXXVI, fig. 9, p. 508.)
=Pileus= thin, fleshy, convex, umbilicate, brownish-floccose, yellowish.
=Gills= very distant, sparingly branched, arcuate-decurrent, pale
ochraceous. =Stem= slender, slightly tapering downward, smooth, shining,
bright orange-tinted yellow, stuffed or hollow.

=Height= 2–3 in., breadth of =Pileus= 8–15 lines.

Mossy ground in woods. Catskill and Adirondack mountains, also Sandlake.
August to October.

This is regarded by some as a variety of A. tubæformis. _Peck_, 23d Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

In mixed and scrub-pine woods near Haddonfield, N.J.; mixed woods Angora
and Kingsessing, Philadelphia.

Perhaps constancy to C. cibarius has influenced the writer in favor of
members of its family, and accounts for the gusto in “Fine” set opposite
his notes to the present species. Nevertheless such is his opinion.


                           ** _Stem tubular._


=C. flocco´sus= Schw.—woolly. (Plate XLVI, fig. 1, p. 214.) =Pileus=
fleshy, elongated funnel-form or trumpet shape, floccose-squamose,
ochraceous-yellow. =Gills= vein-like, close, much anastomosing above,
long decurrent and subparallel below, concolorous. =Stem= very short,
thick, rarely deeply rooting.

=Height= 2–4 in., breadth of =Pileus= at the top 1–3 in.

Woods and their borders. Not rare. Utica, _Johnson_. Albany and
Sandlake. July and August. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=C. bre´vipes= Pk.—_brevis_, short; _pes_, a foot. (Plate XLVI, fig. 5,
p. 214.) =Pileus= fleshy, obconic, glabrous, alutaceous or dingy
cream-color, the thin margin erect, often irregular and lobed, tinged
with lilac in the young plant; folds numerous, nearly straight on the
margin, abundantly anastomosing below, pale umber tinged with lilac.
=Stem= short, tomentose-pubescent, ash-colored, solid, often tapering
downward. =Spores= yellowish, oblong-elliptical, uninucleate, 10–12µ×5µ.

=Plant= 3–4 in. high. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 4–6 lines thick.

Woods. Ballston, Saratoga county. July.

This interesting species is related to the C. floccosus, both by its
short stem and its abundantly anastomosing folds. The two species should
be separated from the others and constitute a distinct section. The
flesh in C. brevipes is soft and whitish, and the folds are generally
thinner than in C. floccosus. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Plentiful in West Virginia mountains in 1884, growing in patches. Found
in mixed woods near Cheltenham, Pa., and at Springton, Pa., 1887.

In West Virginia it is prolific and rivals the C. cibarius in
excellence. The flesh is softer, not so fibrous, and cooks more readily.

In that locality there is a marked difference between C. brevipes and C.
floccosus. The latter is much longer, and markedly resembles the large
end of a gold lined cornet. Like the C. cibarius it is not of as good
quality in eastern states.

(Plate LI.)

[Illustration:

  MARASMIUS OREADES.
  About one-half natural size.
]

=Pileus= regular, thin, tough and pliant. =Gills= pliant, rather tough,
somewhat distant, variously attached or free, with an acute entire edge.
=Stem= cartilaginous or horny, continuous with the pileus but of
different texture. Not putrescent but drying up with lack of moisture,
reviving and assuming the original form with the advent of rain. This
character distinguishes Marasmius from all other genera of Agaricaceæ.

Its nearer relations are Collybia and Mycena.

Fries says that all Agaricaceæ having the smell of garlic are found in
this genus. On the ground, but generally on wood or leaves.

Professor Peck reports over forty species of this genus found in New
York state. Several not found in New York are reported from other
states. The writer has found a few such species in Pennsylvania and West
Virginia. Many untried species will probably prove to be edible; the
majority are too small to be of food value. M. urens, reported
poisonous, and M. peronatus, heretofore considered poisonous, have been
found by the writer to be edible. Several species not described herein
have been tested for edibility to a limited extent only.

In this genus occurs the famed M. oreades, the Mousseron of France, the
Champignon and Scotch bonnet of England, the Fairy-ring mushroom of
America.

=M. u´rens= Fr.—_uro_, to burn. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, unicolorous,
pale yellowish, _becoming pale_, slightly fleshy, _moderately compact at
the disk, even_, but here and there scaly or cracked in wavy lines when
dry, smooth, the thin margin involute. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3 lines
thick, _solid_, composed of crisp tough fibers, rigid, equal, sometimes
however ventricose, ½ in. thick, _everywhere clothed with white flocci,
pale_, white-downy at the base. =Gills= free, united behind, _at length
remote_ from the stem, _distant_, tough, at first pale-wood-color, _then
brown_.

Gregarious, somewhat cespitose. _Taste very stinging._ The stem is not
strigosely sheathed at the base. _Fries._

In mixed woods. Frequent. June to September.

A curious form occurred with the pileus turning very dark when
full-grown. _B. and Br._ POISONOUS. Worthington Smith has tested it by
accident. It produced headache, swimming of brain, burning in throat and
stomach, followed by severe purging and vomiting. _Stevenson._

Gregarious or cespitose. Taste very pungent, a feature which separates
the present from M. oreades. Not coarsely tomentose at the base, as in
M. peronatus, but only downy. _Massee._

=Spores= 3×4µ _W.G.S._; elliptical, 8×4µ _Massee_.

Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia. _McIlvaine._

I have not known it to disagree with myself or friends. That it may not
agree with some persons is unquestioned. Collectors should carefully
test it upon themselves.


=M. perona´tus= Fr.—_pero_, a kind of boot. =Pileus= 1–2 in. and
more broad, light yellowish or pallid brick-red, then becoming
pale, _wood-color_ or tan, at first fleshy-pliant, then
_coriaceo-membranaceous_, convex then plane, obtuse, flaccid,
slightly wrinkled, even at the disk, _at length pitted, striate at
the margin_. =Flesh= white. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1–2 lines thick,
stuffed, fibrous, tough, attenuated upward, _at length hollow_ and
compressed, _furnished with a bark_, light yellow then pallid,
_cuticle villous_ but separating and reddish when rubbed, somewhat
incurved at the base, where it is _clothed with dense, somewhat
strigose_, yellowish or white _villous down_. =Gills= _adnexed,
then separating_, free, moderately _thin_, and _crowded_, when
young whitish, _pallid wood-color_, at length somewhat remote,
reddish.

_B._ Woolly sheathed at the base. Taste acrid like that of M. urens,
odor none. _Fries._

In woods. Common. _Stevenson._

=Spores= pip-shaped, 7×4µ _W.G.S._; 10×6–7µ _Massee_.

New York. Thin woods. North Elba. August. September. _Peck_, 42d Rep.;
West Virginia, June to December, West Philadelphia and Mt. Gretna,
Chester county, Pa. _McIlvaine._

M. peronatus is the wood-cousin of M. oreades. It is still reputed
poisonous by all writers upon the subject, though M.C. Cooke gives it
the benefit of a doubt. The name is given because of the base of the
stem being densely covered with short hairs or a woolly down, and is
thus easily recognized. It is common in woods, among decaying leaves,
especially of the oak, from May until after frosts. It is usually
solitary, but a few individuals are sometimes clustered. It is quite
peppery to the taste, but pleasantly so. I have repeatedly eaten it, as
have my friends. It loses its acridity in cooking, and though the caps
are tougher than M. oreades, they make a highly flavored and delicious
dish. Collectors should carefully test it for themselves.


                   ** _Stem naked at the base, etc._


=M. ore´ades= Fr. _Gr_—mountain-nymphs. Scotch bonnet. Champignon.
Mousseron. (Plate LI, p. 221.) =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad, _reddish then
becoming pale, absorbing moisture, whitish when dry, fleshy_, pliant,
convex then plane, somewhat umbonate, even, smooth, slightly striate at
the margin when moist. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1½ lines thick, _solid_,
very tough, _equal_, tense and straight, _everywhere clothed with a
villous-woven cuticle_ which can be rubbed off, pallid; bluntly rooted
at the base, naked, not villous or tomentose. =Gills= free, broad,
_distant_, the alternate ones shorter, _at first soft_, then firmer,
pallid-white.

_Odor_ weak, but _pleasant_, stronger when dried, _taste mild_. Commonly
growing in circles or rows. _Fries._

=Spores= 6–7×5–6µ _K._; elliptical, 8×5µ _Massee_; nearly elliptical,
white, 7.6–9µ long _Peck_.

Common throughout the states during the summer months after rains, and
in rings, but can be found from May until after frost. If one knows
where the rings are to be found M. oreades can be gathered when
shriveled, and are quite as good, after soaking, as when fresh.

M. oreades must be sought for where the grass is luxuriant. It hides
among it. It is well worthy of the search. Raw, fresh or shriveled, it
is sweet, nutty, succulent when eaten; stewed well it is delicious.
Though tough its consistency is agreeable. The most delicate stomachs
can digest it. The writer saved the life of a lovely woman by feeding
her upon it when nothing else could be retained; and of another, by
feeding Coprinus micaceus, after a dangerous operation. He introduced
these species, together with a few others, into a large hospital in
Philadelphia, where they were used with marked beneficial effect, and
such use is now widespread.

When dried, by exposure to the air or sun, it can be kept indefinitely,
neither losing its aroma or flavor, which it graciously imparts to soups
or any other dish.

Collybia dryophila, Stropharia semi-globata, and Naucoria
semi-orbicularis are sometimes found growing with it. These species are
delicious and harmless.

Lafayette B. Mendel in the Am. Jour. of Physiology, March, 1898, gives
the following analysis:

Twenty freshly gathered specimens (from New Haven) weighed 9 grams, an
average weight of 0.45 grams each. The analysis gave:

                Water                            74.96%

                Total solids                      25.04

                Total nitrogen of dry              5.97

=M. Wyn´nei= B. and Br. =Pileus= 1–1½ in. broad, _lilac_-brown, tardily
changing color, fleshy, convexo-plane, somewhat umbonate. =Stem= 2 in.
long, 1½ line thick, tubed, _furfuraceous_, somewhat of the same color
as the pileus. =Gills= adnexed, thick, distant, bright-colored,
beautifully tinged with _lilac_; interstices even.

Inodorous. Gregarious or cespitose. The stem springs from a white
mycelium, but is by no means strigose or tawny at the base. Quite
distinct from M. fusco-purpureus. _Fries._

Among leaves, twigs, etc. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptical, 7–8×4µ _Massee_.

Kingsessing, West Philadelphia. Gregarious and cespitose, among leaves,
etc., in oak woods. September to October, 1885.

This very pretty fungus very much resembles at first sight the small
purplish Clitocybes, but is readily distinguished on examination. I ate
the caps and enjoyed them during the seasons of 1885 and 1887, but have
not seen the plant since.

The caps are equal to M. oreades.

(not hygrophanous), slightly fleshy, pliant, convex then soon plane,
obtuse, always arid; even when young, at length wrinkled and crisped.
=Stem= 1 in. long, scarcely 1 line thick, _horny_, tough, tubed, equal,
_very smooth throughout, shining, reddish, inserted and naked_ at the

=M. ca´lopes= Fr. _Gr_—beautiful; a foot. =Pileus= about 4 lines broad,
_whitish_, slightly fleshy, tough, convex then flattened, obtuse, rarely
depressed, even, smooth, slightly wrinkled when dried. =Stem= 1 in.
long, 1 line thick, tubed, slightly attenuated upward, even, _smooth_,
tough, dull-red or _bay-brown-red_, shining, _somewhat rooted_. =Gills=
slightly emarginate, in groups of 2–4, thin, white.

_Inodorous._ Almost smaller than M. scorodonius, but the stem is longer,
otherwise very like it. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, 7×4µ _Massee_.

Twigs and stems among fallen leaves in woods. Ticonderoga. August.

This might easily be mistaken for M. scorodonius, but it is without
odor, and has a different insertion of the lamellæ. It is sometimes
cespitose. The pileus in our specimens is whitish. _Peck_, 31st Rep.

Growing on wood.

=Spores= somewhat round, even, white.

Distinguished from other coriaceous genera by its serrated and torn
gills.

“The genera Lentinus and Lenzites are found in every region of the
world; their principal center, however, is in hot countries, where they
attain a splendid development. On the contrary, toward the north they
rapidly decrease in number.” Fungi. _Cooke and Berkeley._

In habitat and mode of growth Lentinus closely resembles Pleurotus, and
parallel genera with colored spores. When young the species are
inviting, and when well cooked are meal-giving. They are not delicacies,
but substantials. They dry well. Grated they make soups, and give their
pleasant flavor to any dish.

=L. Lecom´tei= Fr. =Pileus= coriaceous, funnel-shaped, regularly

tawny.

Common to the states.

Professor Peck writes to me: “This plant, by reason of its rather tough
substance, has commonly been referred to Lentinus, under the name L.
Lecomtei Schw., but this reference is scarcely satisfactory to me, since
the edge of the lamellæ is scarcely at all serrate as required by that
genus. It seems to me it would go better under the genus Panus. It is
variable—sometimes eccentric or even lateral. It is sometimes called
Lentinus strigosus, but I do not think the two are distinct species,
however distinct they may be in form.” February 26, 1894.

Like all Lentinus the present species is rather tough, yet chopped into
small pieces, well cooked and seasoned, it is quite equal to P.
ostreatus and many others of high renown.

Lentinus lepideus is a sort of commercial traveler. It is common
wherever railroads are. It is partial to oak ties and its mycelium is
injurious to them. It is found upon pine and other timbers. The writer
has collected large clusters of it from oak sawdust. The European plant
is noted as “almost always solitary.” In the United States it is seldom
so. It is noted as growing in damp, dark places, but it loves the sun.

As a food it is about on a par with P. ulmarius, not as tough, but
harder when old. It is a reliable species from spring until late autumn,
is persistent and dries well. It is neat, handsome, prolific. When young
it makes a good dish, and when old can be used to advantage in soups.


=L. cochlea´tus= Fr.—_cochlea_, a snail. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad,
flesh-color, but becoming pale, somewhat tan, fleshy-pliant, thin,
commonly excentric, imbricated, very unequal, somewhat lobed or
contorted, sometimes plane, sometimes funnel-shaped-umbilicate, but not
pervious, _smooth_. =Stem= solid, firm, sometimes central, most
frequently excentric, sometimes wholly lateral, _always sulcate,
smooth_, flesh-colored upward, reddish-brown downward. =Gills=
decurrent, crowded, serrated, white-flesh-color. _Fries._

Pliant, tough, flaccid, very changeable in form, sometimes solitary,
sometimes cespitose, imbricated, growing into each other. From very
small forms which are commonly solitary, with the stem and pileus
scarcely 1 in. it ranges to 3 in.

On stumps. Frequent. August to October.

According to Fries the odor is weak, of anise; but it is generally
strong and very pleasant. _Stevenson._

=Spores= nearly globular, 4µ diameter _Morgan_; spheroid or
ellipsoid-spheroid, uniguttate, 4–6µ _K._; almost globular, 4µ _W.G.S._

The dense clusters of all sized members are usually plenty in favored
localities. It is inviting in appearance, taste and spicy odor. It
retains a suspicion of the latter when cooked which gives the dish a
flavor pleasant to many. It must be young to be tender. When dry—like
others of its kind—it can be grated and used in many ways.


=L. Un´derwoodii= Pk. =Pileus= fleshy, tough, convex or nearly plane,
the glabrous surface cracking into areola-like scales which are
indistinct or wanting toward the margin, whitish or slightly tinged with
buff or pale ochraceous. =Flesh= white. =Gills= moderately close,
decurrent, slightly connecting or anastomosing at the base, somewhat
notched on the edge, whitish, becoming discolored in drying. =Stem=
stout, hard, solid, eccentric, squamose, colored like the pileus.
=Spores= oblong, 13–15×5–6.5µ.

=Plant= cespitose. =Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, about
1 in. thick.

This differs from L. magnus in its cespitose habit, eccentric stem,
longer spores, less distinctly areolate-squamose pileus and in its
habitat. The gills are connected at the base very much like those of
Pleurotus ostreatus. _Peck_, Torr. Bull. Vol. 23, No. 10.

North Carolina, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

The writer first met with it in North Carolina, near Washington, on oaks
and railroad timbers, and in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. It attains
quite a size, grows singly and in clusters. Its clean, cake-like
appearance is attractive. Cooked it ranks with P. ulmarius, L. lepideus,
and Panus strigosus.

                              =PA´NUS= Fr.

            A name given to a tree-growing fungus by Pliny.


                                                            (Plate LIV.)

[Illustration:

  PANUS TORULOSUS.
  About one-fourth natural size.
]

Whole fungus between fleshy and leathery, tough, not woody, texture
fibrous. =Gills= unequal, tough, becoming leathery, edge acute and
unbroken. =Stem= present or absent.

Growing on wood. Various in form, lasting long. Allied to Lentinus but
differing in the tough and very entire gills.

=Spores= even, white.


                          ANALYSIS OF SPECIES.

* Stem excentric.

** Stem lateral.

*** Stem absent. Pileus resupinate or dimidiate.

Species of this genus are among our most observable fungi. Their
settlements are frequent on decaying trees, stumps, branches, on fences,
cut timber, etc. Most of them are small, but their coriaceous build
prevents their shrinking in cooking. Most species have a pleasant
farinaceous taste and odor, which they yield, together with a gummy
substance, to soups and gravies.

Tasting a small piece will immediately tell, if the species is not
known, whether it is edible or of the styptic kind.

                          * _Stem excentric._


=P. concha´tus= Fr.—Formed like _concha_, a shell-fish. =Pileus= about 3
in. across, tough and flexible, unequal, excentric or dimidiate, margin
often lobed, cinnamon-color becoming pale, at length more or less scaly.
=Flesh= thin. =Gills= narrow, forming decurrent lines on the stem,
somewhat branched; pinkish-white then pale-ochraceous. =Stem= about ⅔
in. long, 3–4 lines thick, solid, unequal, pale, base downy. _Massee._

On trunks of beech, poplar, etc.

Often imbricated and more or less grown together. Allied to Panus
torulosus, but distinguished by the much thinner pileus, more expanded
and excentric, also dimidiate, flaccid, cinnamon becoming pale, but the
form not constant. =Stem= about ½ in. long, 4 lines thick, often
compressed, downy at the base. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, scaly when old.
=Gills= decurrent in long, parallel lines, not at all resembling those
of Pleurotus ostreatus, which anastomose behind, but frequently
unequally branched, at first whitish or pale flesh-color, then
wood-color, crisped when dry. _Fries._

Always known by its shell-like form and its tough substance.

Sent to the writer by Mr. E.B. Sterling, Trenton, N.J. September, 1898.

The appearance of scales upon the pileus was scarcely noticeable. Taste
pleasant. The fungus is tough when old, but yields an excellent gravy.

=P. torulo´sus= Fr.—a tuft of hair. (Plate LIV, p. 232.) =Pileus= 2–3
in. broad, somewhat flesh-color, but varying reddish-livid and becoming
violet, _entire_, but very excentric, fleshy, somewhat compact when
young, _plano-infundibuliform, even_, smooth. =Flesh= pallid. =Stem=
short, commonly 1 in., solid, oblique, tough, firm, commonly with gray,
but often violaceous _down_. =Gills= decurrent, somewhat distant,
simple, separate behind, reddish then tan-color.

Very changeable in form, at first fleshy-pliant, at length coriaceous.
In the covering of the stem it approaches Paxillus atro-tomentosus, but
there is no affinity between them. _Fries._

On old stumps.

=Spores= 6×3µ _W.G.S._

North Carolina, _Curtis_; Massachusetts, _Frost_; Minnesota, _Johnson_;
Kansas, _Cragin_; New York, _Peck_, Rep. 30.

Much esteemed in France, _W.D.H._ Edible, but tough. _M.C.C._


=P. lævis= B. and C.—light. =Pileus= 3 in. broad, orbicular, slightly
depressed, white, clothed in the center with long, intricate, rather
delicate hairs, which are shorter and more matted toward the inflected
margin; substance rather thin. =Stem= 3 in. high, ½ in. thick,
attenuated upward, generally excentric, sometimes lateral, not rooting,
solid, hairy below like the margin of the pileus. =Gills= rather broad,
entire, decurrent, but not to a great degree, the interstices even
above, behind clothed with the same coat as the top of the stem.
=Spores= white.

On oak and hickory trunks.

A most distinct species, remarkable for its great lightness when dry and
the long villous but not compressed or compound flocci of the pileus.
Sometimes the center of the pileus becomes quite smooth when old.

One of the prettiest of fungi. The markings upon the white margin are
more precise than those of the finest bee comb. One does not tire
looking at the work of Nature’s geometrician. It is not plentiful, but
is of useful size. It has good flavor and cooks quite tender.


(Plate LV_a_.)

[Illustration:

  PANUS STRIGOSUS.

=P. strigo´sus= B. and C.—covered with stiff hairs. =Pileus= white,
excentric, clothed with coarse strigose pubescence, margin thin. =Stem=
strigose like the pileus. =Gills= broad, distant, decurrent. Allied to
P. lævis.

=Pileus= 8 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1 in. or more thick.

On oak stumps.

Decaying wood of deciduous trees. September.

It is remarkable for its large size and the dense hairy covering of the
pileus and stem. _Peck_, 26th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

A remarkably handsome fungus. A specimen taken from a cluster growing
upon an apple tree measured 10 in. across. Its creamy whiteness, and
short hairy stem make it unmistakable among other tree-fungi.

When very young it is edible, but soon becomes woody. Even when aged it
yields a well flavored gravy.


                           ** _Stem lateral._

=P. farina´ceus= Schum.—_farina_, meal. From the scurf on the pileus.
Pileus cinnamon-umber, somewhat coriaceous, flexuous, cuticle separating
into whitish-bluish-gray scurf. =Stem= short, lateral, of the same color
as the pileus. =Gills= determinately free, distinct, paler.

The habit is that of P. stipticus. _Stevenson._

Pennsylvania, A. pleurotus f., _Schweinitz_; Ohio, _Morgan_.

Var. albido-tomentosus. See Panus albido-tomentosus.

=P. al´bido-tomento´sus= CKE. MASS.—_albidus_, white; _tomentum_, down.
=Pileus= about ⅔ in. long, ½ in. broad, horizontal, sometimes
imbricated, semi-circular, subcoriaceous, flexuous or regular, pale
umber, densely clothed with a short, whitish, velvety down, which seems
to be persistent, but thinner and shorter toward the shortly incurved
margin. =Stem= lateral, very short, or entirely absent, and attached by
a downy base. =Gills= radiating from the point of attachment; narrowed
behind, lanceolate, honey-colored, margin entire, rigid, scarcely
crowded, shorter ones intermixed. =Spores= subglobose, smooth, 5µ
diameter.

On trunks and branches.

=Pileus= about 1 in. broad, often in imbricated tufts. It is doubtful
whether this is not a distinct species from the type described by Fries.
_Cooke and Massee._

Panus albido-tomentosus is given by Cooke and Massee as a variety of
Panus farinaceus. The writer decides to give it place as a species.

It has been sent to me by Mr. H.I. Miller, from Terre Haute, Ind., by
Dr. E.L. Cushing, Albion, N.Y., Miss Madeleine Le Moyne, Washington, Pa.
I have found it in West Virginia, New Jersey and many parts of
Pennsylvania. It is plentiful in patches upon branches and boles of
deciduous trees. Long, slow cooking makes it tender. It makes a luscious
gravy after thirty minutes' stewing.


           *** _Stem absent, pileus resupinate or dimidiate._

=P. betuli´nus= Pk.—_betula_, birch. =Pileus= thin, suborbicular or
dimidiate, nearly plane, glabrous, prolonged behind into a short stem,
grayish-brown, darker or blackish toward the stem. =Gills= narrow,
close, decurrent, whitish. Stem adorned with a slight tawny hairiness
which is more fully developed toward the base. =Spores= minute,
4–5×1.5–2µ.

Decaying wood of birch. Newfoundland. October, _Rev. A.C. Waghorne_.
_Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 23, No. 10.

Common in West Virginia mountains on birches, 1882; found at Eagle’s
Mere, Pa., August, 1898. Quite plentiful on decaying birch trees, which
abound there. Size from ½-1½ in. across.

Eaten raw it has a gummy quality and very pleasant nutty flavor. I did
not have opportunity to cook it, but regard it as a species well worth
trying.


=P. stip´ticus= Fr.—_stypticus_, astringent. =Pileus= ½-1 in. broad,
cinnamon becoming pale, arid, thin, but not membranaceous,
kidney-shaped, pruinose, the _cuticle separating into furfuraceous
scales_. =Stem= not reaching 1 in. long, solid, _definitely lateral_,
compressed, _dilated upward_, ascending, pruinose, paler than the gills.
=Gills= ending determinately (not decurrent), thin, very narrow,
crowded, _elegantly connected by veins_, cinnamon. _Fries._

Gregarious, cespitose, remarkable for _its astringent taste_. The pileus
sometimes has a funnel-shaped appearance with lobes all around.

On stumps, etc. Common. August to February.

Reckoned poisonous. _Stevenson._

=Spores= obovoid-spheroid, 2–3×1–2µ _K._; 3×4µ _W.G.S._

Plentiful and general. The markings upon the cap in moist weather are
sometimes exquisitely regular.

The immediate and lasting unpleasantness of this fungus to mouth and
throat, whether cooked or raw, will cancel all desire to eat of it
forevermore. A nibble will detect it. It is reckoned poisonous, and may
be. No one but a determined suicide would resort to it. Dr. Lambotte
asserts that it is a violent purgative.

growing on wood, quite resembling Dædalea. _Fries._

Allied most nearly to Trametes and Dædalea and forming as it were the
transition from Agaricaceæ to Polyporaceæ. In tropical countries they
are more woody in texture. _Stevenson._

In Volvaria, Pluteus and most of Clitopilus, the spores are regular in
shape, as in the white-spored series, in the rest of the subgenera they
are generally angular and irregular.

Though European writers, generally, condemn the rosy-spored series as
inedible, a few of our best American edibles are found in it—notably
Pluteus cervinus.

=Spores= regular, oval, pink, or salmon. =Veil= universal, forming a
perfect _volva_, distinct from the cuticle of the pileus. =Stem=
separating easily from the pileus. =Gills= _free_, rounded behind, at
the very first white then pinkish, soft. Analogous with Amanita.

Growing in woods and on rich mold, rotten wood and damp ground, hence
often found in hot-houses and gardens. V. Loveiana Berk. is parasitic on
Clitocybe nebularis.

There are thirteen species reported from different parts of the United
States. Most of them grow upon wood. Two species have previously been
reported as edible, to which I have added V. Taylori, tested by myself.

One species, V. gloiocephala, is upon the authority of Letellier, given
as poisonous. It is found in several parts of the United States, but no
comment has been made upon its edibility. I have not seen it. A careful
study of its botanic characters is urged. It should be regarded as
poisonous until its reputation is cleared up, as it probably will be.

                          ANALYSIS OF SPECIES.

=V. bombyci´na= Schaeff.—_bombyx_, silk. =Pileus= 3–8 in. broad, _wholly
white_, fleshy, soft, at first globose, soon bell-shaped, at length
convex, somewhat umbonate, _everywhere silky_ or, _when older,
hairy-scaled_, more rarely becoming smooth at the vertex. =Flesh= not
thick, white. =Stem= 3–6 in. long, ½ in. thick or more at the base,
solid, equally attenuated from the base to the apex, even, smooth,
white. =Volva=, soon torn asunder, ample, 2–3 in. broad, membranaceous,
lax, slashed, somewhat viscid, persistent. =Gills= free, very crowded
when young, almost cohering, ventricose, in groups of 2–4, then toothed,
flesh-colored.

Ovate when young. According to some becoming brownish. The stem is
curved-ascending on vertical trunks and straight on prostrate ones.
Commonly solitary, sometimes however cespitose. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptic, smooth, 6–7×4µ _Massee_; 6–8µ _Lloyd_.

Considered edible. _Stevenson._ Edible. _Curtis._

Very general but not common over the United States. It is a large plant,
from 3 in. upward across cap. Growing from wood, oaks, maples, beech,
etc.

The writer has not been successful in finding it. Drawing, spore-print
and description received from _H.I. Miller_, Terre Haute, Ind.

Upon such an authority as the late Dr. Curtis there is no doubt of its
edibility.


(Plate LX.)

[Illustration:

  VOLVARIA VOLVACEA.
  Two-fifths natural size.

=V. volva´cea= Bull.—_volva_, a wrapper. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across.
=Flesh= white, thick at the disk, very thin elsewhere, soft, bell-shaped
then expanded, obtuse, grayish-yellow, virgate or streaked with
adpressed blackish fibrils. =Gills= free, about 2 lines broad, pale
flesh-color. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, about 4 lines thick, almost equal,
white, solid. Volva large, loose, whitish. =Spores= smooth, elliptical,
6–8×3.5–4µ; no cystidia. _Massee._

On the ground by roadsides, etc., also in stoves.

Allied to V. bombycina, but constantly different in the less ample and
less persistent, brownish volva. =Pileus= 3 in. across, rarely more,
gray, elegantly virgate with blackish fibrils; flesh-color of the gills
not so pure. _Fries._

Once found in woods at roots of a tree. It occurs every year in the
cellar of our drug store. _Lloyd_ “Volvæ.”

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_; Minnesota, _Johnson_; Ohio, _Morgan_.

Probably edible, should be carefully tested.


=V. Tay´lori= Berk. =Pileus= 1¾ in. high and broad, livid,
conico-campanulate, obtuse, striately cracked from the apex, thin,
margin lobed and sinuated. =Stem= 2½ in. long, ¼ in. thick, pallid,
solid, nearly equal, slightly bulbous at the base. =Volva= date-brown,
lobed, somewhat lax, small. =Gills= uneven, broad in front, very much
attenuated behind, rose-color.

Pileus beautifully penciled and cracked. The dark volva, bell-shaped
pileus, and uneven, attenuated gills are marked characters. The habit is
rather that of some Entoloma than of its more immediate allies. _Fries._

=Spores= 6×9µ _W.G.S._; broadly elliptical, smooth, 5×3.5–4µ _Massee_.

Indiana, _Mrs. L.H. Cox_; West Philadelphia, in much decayed stump of
maple. _McIlvaine._

=Caps= 1½-2 in. across and beautifully penciled and cracked. =Stem= 1½-3
in. long. =Gills= up to ⅓ in. wide. The spores when shed in body are a
beautiful maroon. Resembling V. volvacea, but lighter in color, and
having a brown volva. Specimens sent me by J.J. Newbaker, Steelton, Pa.,
had snow-white caps and when young were velvety to the touch. Gills
tinged with pink; volva dark brown.

The few specimens eaten were of good flavor, somewhat resembling Pluteus
cervinus.


                **_Pileus more or less viscid, smooth._


=V. specio´sa= Fr.—_speciosus_, handsome. =Pileus= 3–5 in. broad,
whitish, _gray_ or umber _at the disk_, fleshy, globose when young, then
bell-shaped, at length plane and somewhat umbonate, even, _smooth,
gluey_. =Flesh= soft, floccose, white. =Stem= 4–8 in. long, as much as 1
in. thick, solid, firm, slightly attenuated from the base as far as the
apex, when young, _white-villous_ and tomentose at the base, then
becoming smooth, white. =Volva= bulbous rather than lax, free however,
variously torn into loops, membranaceous, ½-1 in. broad, externally
tomentose, white. =Gills= free, flesh-colored.

The gills are wholly the same as those of A. bombycinus. It occurs also
thinner, with the pileus wholly gray. _Fries._

=Spores= 12–18×8–10µ _K._; elliptical or subglobose, smooth, 14–16×8µ
_Massee_.

Distinguished by the whitish, viscid pileus, and the downy volva and
stem. _Massee._

“Common in cultivated soil, especially grain fields and along roads. A
fine edible agaric and our most abundant one in California.”
_McClatchie._ Volvæ, U.S., Lloyd.


=V. gloioceph´ala= Dec. Fl. _Gr_—sticking; head. =Pileus= dark opaque
brown, fleshy, bell-shaped then expanded, umbonate, smooth, _glutinous_,
striate at the margin. =Stem= solid, _smooth_, becoming brownish or
tawny; the _volva_, which is _circularly split_, pressed close. =Gills=
free, reddish.

Fragments of the volva are sometimes seen on the pileus. The stem is
commonly more slender than that of A. speciosus. _Fries._

On the ground. Uncommon. June to October. _Stevenson._

Pileus about 3 in. across, with a strong regular, obtuse umbo in the
center, of a delicate mouse-gray, viscid when moist, but when dry
shining, quite smooth, margin striate in consequence of the thinness of
the flesh. =Stem= 6 in. or more high, about ½ in. thick in the center,
attenuated upward, bulbous at the base, clothed with a few slight
fibers, easily splitting, solid, rather dingy, ringless. =Volva= loose,
villous like the base of the stem, splitting into several unequal lobes;
the gills are broad, especially in front, narrower behind and quite
free, so as to leave a space round the top of the stem, white, tinged
with grayish-pink; margin slightly toothed. Smell strong and unpleasant,
and taste disagreeable. _M.J.B._ VERY POISONOUS according to Letellier.
_Stevenson._

=Spores= 19×9µ _W.G.S._; elliptical, smooth, 10–12×6–7µ _Massee_.

Distinguished by the smoky, glutinous pileus. The measurement of the
spores as given by Saccardo (19×9µ) is certainly too large, and is
probably an uncorrected error. _Massee._

       (_Pluteus_, a shed. From the conical shape of the pileus.)


=Stem= fleshy, distinct from the pileus. =Gills= free, rounded behind
(never emarginate), at first cohering, white, then colored by the
spores.

Generally growing on or near trunks of trees.

Resembling Volvaria in all respects but the volva. =Spores= rosy.

Several of the genus are edible. Pluteus cervinus is one of our
earliest, persistent, plentiful, delicious food species. The caps of
those tested are tender, easily cooked and best fried.

                          ANALYSIS OF SPECIES.

* Cuticle of the pileus separating into fibrils or down, which at length
disappear.

** Pileus frosted with atoms, somewhat powdery.

*** Pileus naked, smooth.


                 * _Cuticle of pileus fibrillose, etc._


=P. cervi´nus= Schaeff.—_cervus_, a deer. (Plate LXI, fig. 1, p. 242.)
=Pileus= fleshy, at first campanulate, then convex or expanded, _even,
glabrous, generally becoming fibrillose or slightly floccose-villose_ on
the disk, occasionally cracked, variable in color. =Lamellæ= broad,
somewhat ventricose, at first whitish, then flesh-colored. =Stem= equal
or slightly tapering upward, firm, solid, fibrillose or subglabrous,
variable in color. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 6.5–8×5–6.5µ.

=Plant= 2–6 in. high. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–6 lines thick.

The typical form has the pileus and stem of a dingy or brown color and
adorned with blackish fibrils, but specimens occur with the pileus
white, yellowish, cinereous, grayish-brown or blackish-brown. I have
never seen it of a true cervine color. It is sometimes quite glabrous
and smooth to the touch and in wet weather it is even slightly viscid.
It also occurs somewhat floccose-villose on the disk, and the disk,
though usually plane or obtuse, is occasionally slightly prominent or
subumbonate. The form with the surface of the pileus longitudinally
rimose or chinky is probably due to meteorological conditions. The
gills, though at first crowded, become more lax with the expansion of
the pileus. They are generally a little broader toward the marginal than
toward the inner extremity. Their tendency to deliquesce is often shown
by their wetting the paper on which the pileus has been placed for the
purpose of catching the spores. The stem is usually somewhat fibrous and
striated but forms occur in which it is even and glabrous. When growing
from the sides of stumps and prostrate trunks it is apt to be curved.
Two forms deserve varietal distinction.

Var. _al´bus_. Pileus and stem white or whitish.

Var. _al´bipes_. Pileus cinereous yellowish or brown. Stem white or
whitish, destitute of blackish fibrils.

In Europe there are three or four forms which have been designated as
species under the names of A. rigens, A. patricius, A. eximius and A.
petasatus, but Fries gives them as varieties or subspecies of A.
cervinus, though admitting that they are easily distinguished. None of
these have occurred in our state. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Var. _visco´sus_. The normal character of the cuticle of the species is
slightly viscid in wet weather, but the specimens we collected and
photographed were exceedingly viscid. They also differed from the normal
form in their lighter color, flesh much thicker at the disk and thin at
the margins, and cuticle not appearing fibrillose. It is close to
petasatus, but differs, however, in its narrower gills and in having no
striæ. It is a good variety if it is not a good species. _Lloyd_, Myc.
Notes.

=Spores= 7–8×5–6µ _K._; 6–8×4–5µ _B._; 4×5µ _W.G.S._; 5.8×4.6µ _Morgan_.

Frequent on decaying stumps, roots and wood, May to frost. _McIlvaine._

Its free gills should distinguish it from any Entoloma, though both have
pink spores and eventually pink gills. Among the earliest of large
species. The sight of it is stimulating to the mycophagist. He then
knows the toadstool season to be truly opened.

Caps only are tender. The stems are edible, but they are not of the same
consistency as the caps, therefore will not cook with them. Fried in a
buttered pan or broiled, they are exceedingly toothsome.

In October, 1898, a beautiful variety (see Plate LXI, fig. 2, p.—),
occurred which I had not previously seen. It was sent by me to Professor
Peck. The plants grew in large clusters from rotting, refuse straw in
the ruin of a stable; the white, cottony mycelium running upon and
through the straw. The solid stems of some were straight, others curved,
ranging from 2–6 in. long, the taller ones tapering from base to
spindling apex, the shorter ones decidedly bulbous and ending abruptly.
They were twisted and delicately marked. These markings break up into
dark thread-like fibrils, leaving the stem striate and satin-glossy.
=Pileus= from 2–4 in. across, dark Vandyke-brown when young, lighter in
age, streaked, glossy. =Gills= at first white, tardily changing to light
salmon color, broad, ventricose, free.

Taste and smell pleasant of almonds. Good, delicious.

Professor Peck wrote of it: “It has the general appearance of Pluteus
cervinus, but these specimens seem to depart from the usual form of
growing in clusters from the ground, and in having an almond flavor.
Without knowing more about it I would scarcely feel justified in
separating it from such a variable species. As Fries sometimes remarks
concerning variable species: Perhaps several species are concealed under
the one name, but a pretty full and accurate knowledge of them is
desirable if one is to split them up.”

This is excellent judgment. While I believe the above to be a distinct
species, the disposition to make new species of varieties is regrettable
in many botanists.

Var. _Bul´lii_ Berk., MS. =Pileus= 4–6 in. across, flesh thick, convex
then expanded, smooth, even, pallid, the disk darker. =Gills= free,
rounded behind, rather distant from the stem, crowded, ½ in. broad, pale
salmon-color. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 1 in. and more thick, slightly
swollen at the base, fibrillose, pale brown, darkest at the base, solid.
_Massee._

=Pileus= 6 in. across, expanded from bell-shape, ashy-white (oyster
color), glossy, like floss silk, silky fibrillose, irregularly
corrugated. =Skin= separable. =Flesh= spongy, pure white, like shreds of
cotton, separable into plates, very brittle, ½ in. thick at stem,
immediately thinning to ⅛ in., very thin toward margin. =Gills= thin,
elastic, rounded behind, close to stem, free, ½ in. wide, close,
alternate short and long, white, then tinged and spotted pink with
spores which when cast in mass are a pinkish-brown with slight lavender
shade. =Stem= 5 in. long, ½-¾ in. thick, subequal, spreading at top,
white, silky-fibrillose, changing to very light yellowish brown from
center to base, exterior hard, skin thin, tough, interior filled with
continuous, cottony fibers, snow-white, brittle, watery, slightly
swollen at base. Taste pleasant.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., July, 1898, on chestnut stump and in woods on ground
among leaves. Leaves adhere to base of stem which is powdery-white.
_McIlvaine._

Cooked, it is as good as P. cervinus.

Var. _petasa´tus_ Fr. =Pileus= 3–4 in. across, flesh rather thick,
campanulate then expanded, umbonate, grayish-white, very smooth, with a
viscid cuticle, at length striate to the middle. =Gills= free, ½ in. and
more broad, crowded, becoming dry, white then reddish. =Stem= 4–5 in.
long, ½-⅔ in. thick, rigid, very slightly and equally attenuated from
the base, whitish, fibrillosely striate, solid.

On heaps of straw and dung, sawdust, etc.

Color verging on bay when old. Stem and margin of gills at length with a
tawny tinge. _Fries._

Haddonfield, New Jersey, Bell’s Mill, sawdust, 1890; Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
August, 1898, among sawdust from ice-house. =Caps= 6 in. across. =Stem=
easily split, exterior hard, fibrillose, streaked, whitish, shining,
stuffed with cottony fibers. =Spores= dark pink. _McIlvaine._

Equal to P. cervinus.


=P. umbro´sus= Pers.—shady, from its dark color. =Pileus= fleshy, at
first bell-shaped, then convex or expanded, _roughly wrinkled_ and more
or less villose on the disk, fimbriate on the margin, _blackish-brown_.
=Gills= broad, somewhat ventricose, at first whitish, then
flesh-colored, _blackish-brown and fringed or toothed on the edge_.
=Stem= solid, colored like or paler than the pileus, fibrillose or
villose-squamose. =Spores= elliptical, 8×5µ.

Decaying woods and swamps, especially of pine, both in shaded and open
places. Not rare. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= broadly elliptical, smooth, 6–7×5µ; cystidia ventricose,
65–75×18–20µ _Massee_.

New York, _Peck_, Rep. 32, 38; West Virginia, Pennsylvania, North
Carolina, New Jersey, frequent on decaying logs, stumps, pine and other
woods. _McIlvaine._

At times the caps are a deep sepia-brown. It is readily distinguished
from P. cervinus by the wrinkled, downy disk of the cap and the gills
having dark-brown edges. Smell rather strong. Professor Peck says he has
not seen it with the margin fimbriate. Neither have I, though this is
prominent in the European species.

P. umbrosus is a fine species, equal in every way to P. cervinus, which
is seldom excelled. Caps only are tender.


=P. pelli´tus= Fr. =Pileus= 1–2 in. across. =Flesh= thin, soft, white,
convex then plane, somewhat umbonate, regular, silky-fibrous, dry,
white. =Gills= free, rounded behind, crowded, 1½ line broad, ventricose,
white then flesh-color, margin slightly toothed. =Stem= about 2 in.
long, 2–3 lines thick, slightly thickened at the base, even, glabrous,
shining, white, stuffed. =Spores= elliptical, smooth, 10×6µ.

Among grass at the roots of trees, etc.

Our only Pluteus with a pure white, even pileus and stem. Superficially
resembling Entoloma prunuloides, which differs in the broadly
emarginate—not free—gills, and in the strong smell of new meal.
_Massee._

Mt. Gretna, Pa., October, 1898. _McIlvaine._

=Pileus= up to 3 in. across. =Gills= ¼ in. broad, free, moist,
imbricated. =Stem= up to 5 in. long, easily detachable from cap, solid,
juicy, solitary and cespitose. On very old sawdust, upon which grass was
growing.

Tender, excellent.


                       ** _Pileus frosted, etc._


=P. granula´ris= Pk.—sprinkled with grains. =Pileus= convex or nearly
plane, subumbonate, _rugose-wrinkled, granulose or granulose-villose_,
varying in color from yellow to brown. =Lamellæ= rather broad, crowded,
ventricose, whitish, then flesh colored. =Stem= equal, solid, colored
like the pileus, often paler at the top, _velvety-pubescent_, rarely
scaly. =Spores= subglobose or broadly elliptical, 6.5–8×5–6.5µ.

=Plant= 1.5–3 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 lines thick.

Decaying wood and prostrate trunks in woods. Hilly and mountainous
districts. June to September.

The species is closely related to P. cervinus and P. umbrosus, but is
readily distinguished from them by the peculiar vesture of the pileus
and stem. The granules are so minute and so close that they form a sort
of plush on the pileus, more dense on the disk and radiating wrinkles
than elsewhere. The clothing of the stem is finer, and has a
velvety-pubescent appearance, but in some instances it breaks up into
small scales or squamules. The color of the pileus and stem is usually
some shade of yellow or brown, but occasionally a grayish hue
predominates. The darker color of the granules imparts a dingy or smoky
tinge to the general color. The disk is often darker than the rest of
the pileus. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia mountains. Eagle’s Mere and Springton Hills, Pa.

Frequent. July to October, on decaying wood. _McIlvaine._

P. granularis is a much smaller species than P. cervinus and its allies.
At Eagle’s Mere, Pa., August, 1898, it was quite plentiful in mixed
woods. Its caps are excellent.


                          *** _Pileus naked._


=P. admira´bilis= Pk.—admirable. =Pileus= thin, convex or expanded,
generally broadly umbonate, glabrous, _rugose-reticulated_, moist or
hygrophanous, striatulate on the margin when moist, often obscurely
striate when dry, yellow or brown. =Lamellæ= close, broad, rounded
behind, ventricose, whitish or yellowish, then flesh-colored. =Stem=
slender, glabrous, _hollow_, equal or slightly thickened at the base,
yellow or yellowish white, with a white mycelium. =Spores= subglobose or
broadly elliptical, 6.5–8×6.5µ.

Var. _fus´cus_. =Pileus= brown or yellowish-brown.

=Plant= 1–2 in. high. =Pileus= 6–10 lines broad. =Stem= .5–1 line thick.

Decaying wood and prostrate trunks in forests. Common in hilly and
mountainous districts. July to September.

This beautiful Pluteus is closely related to P. chrysophlebius B. and
R., a southern species, which, according to the description, has the
veins of the pileus darker colored than the rest of the surface and the
stem enlarged above and hairy at the base, characters not shown by our
plant.

In our plant small young specimens sometimes have the stem solid, but
when fully developed it is hollow, though the cavity is small. This
character, with its small size, distinguishes it from P. leoninus.
_Peck_, 38th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Springton Hills, Chester county, Pa., Mt. Gretna, Pa. Frequent. June to
frost. _McIlvaine._

Possesses the same rare edible qualities as P. cervinus, P. umbrosus.
The caps, only, are tender.


=P. chrysophæ´us= Schaeff. _Gr_—gold. =Pileus= 1–2½ in. across. =Flesh=
very thin except at the disk, bell-shaped then expanded, glabrous,
naked, slightly wrinkled, margin striate, cinnamon-color. =Gills= free,
2–3 lines broad, whitish then pale salmon-color. =Stem= 2–3 in. long,
2–3 lines thick, whitish, glabrous, equal, more or less hollow.

On beech trunks, etc.

Resembling P. leoninus in size, but differing in the cinnamon color of
the pileus, which is often obtusely umbonate. _Massee._

=Spores= 5µ _W.P._

Haddonfield, N.J. June to October, beech roots and trunks. _McIlvaine._

Excellent.




                            =ENTOLO´MA= Fr.

                      _Gr_—within; _Gr_—a fringe.
    (Probably referring to the innate character of the pseudo veil.)


=Pileus= rather fleshy, margin incurved, without a distinct veil. =Stem=
fleshy or fibrous, soft, sometimes waxy, continuous with the flesh of
the pileus. =Gills= _sinuate_, adnexed, often separating from the stem.
=Spores= rosy, elliptical, smooth or subglobose and coarsely warted.

Corresponding in structure with Tricholoma, Hebeloma and Hypholoma;
separated from other rosy-spored genera by the sinuate gills.

About twenty species of Entoloma are given in the states; of them
seventeen are described by Professor Peck, as found in New York. I have
not found a single species in sufficient quantity to test its edibility.

Two of the European species, E. sinuata Fr. and E. livida Bull., are
reputed to be very poisonous, producing headache, dizziness, vomiting,
etc. Worthington Smith ate ¼ oz., which nearly proved fatal.

Professor Peck reports a species, E. grande Pk., which he considers
suspicious.

Even the reported poisonous species have a pleasant odor corresponding
to those of the esculent species. This makes them the more deceptive and
dangerous. The pinkish or flesh-colored spores and gills distinguish
Entoloma from Hebeloma, which has brown spores, and Tricholoma, which
has white. Pluteus, which has pink spores and gills, is readily
separated from it.

Great caution should be observed. Entolomas should be thrown away or
carefully tested.

The flavor of this mushroom is not at first disagreeable, but an
unpleasant burning sensation is left in the mouth for a considerable
time after tasting. It is therefore to be regarded with suspicion.
_Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

SUSPICIOUS. I have not seen this species. It is given that it may be
guarded against until tested for edibility.

“Wholesome and very good to eat.” _Cordier._

In the presence of such opposite opinions it is better to choose the
safer. Do not eat it.

=Pileus= more or less excentric or regular, margin at first involute.
=Gills= more or less decurrent, never sinuate nor seceding from the
stem, salmon-color. =Stem= fleshy or fibrous, not polished and
cartilaginous externally, central, expanded upward into the flesh of the
pileus. =Spores= smooth or warted.

Closely resembling Eccilia, differing mostly in the stem not being
cartilaginous at the surface. Distinguished from Entoloma by the gills
not being sinuate.

Agrees in structure with Clitocybe in the Leucosporæ. _Massee._

Growing on the ground, often strong smelling. Caps usually depressed or
umbilicate and waved on margin.

Some of the best of edible kinds are within this genus; a few are
unpleasant raw, none poisonous.

Most authors follow Fries in the arrangement of the species, dividing
them into two groups, the Orcelli, distinguished by deeply decurrent
gills and an irregular, scarcely hygrophanous pileus, with the margin at
first flocculose; and Sericelli, distinguished by adnate or slightly
decurrent gills and a regular silky or hygrophanous-silky pileus with a
naked margin. This arrangement is not strictly applicable to some of our
species. C. abortivus, C. erythrosporus and C. Noveaboracensis have the
gills deeply decurrent in some individuals, adnate or slightly decurrent
in others, and therefore the same species might be sought in both
groups. For this reason the primary grouping of our species has been
made to depend upon the variation in the spore colors. By far the
greater number of our species appear to be peculiar to this country,
only two of them occurring also in Europe.

Not abundant, but edible, and said to be delicious and one of the best
of the esculent species. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

June to October. Most plentiful in August and September.

Very plentiful in oak woods at Angora, West Philadelphia, moderate crops
at Mt. Gretna, Pa.

An abortive form (see Plate LXIII, fig. 2, 3, p. 254) occurs not
distinguishable from that of Armillaria mellea. It grows singly and in
tufts, very variable in shape, white, tinged with brown on ruptured
surfaces. This form equals its original.

C. prunulus has a strong smell of fresh meal. It is a delicious species.

Stew. It is one of the very best in patties, croquettes, etc.

=C. Orcel´la= Bull.—=Pileus= fleshy, _soft_, plane or slightly
depressed, often irregular, even when young, _slightly silky, somewhat
viscid when moist_, white or yellowish-white. =Flesh= white, taste and
odor farinaceous. =Gills= deeply decurrent, _close_, whitish then
flesh-colored. =Stem= short, solid, flocculose, often eccentric,
thickened above, white. =Spores= elliptical, 9–10×5µ.

Generally a little smaller than the preceding species, softer and more
irregular, but so closely allied that by some it is considered a mere
variety of it. It is said to be edible and of delicate flavor. It occurs
in wet weather in pastures and open places. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

Grows in oak woods, Angora, West Philadelphia; Mt. Gretna, Pa.

Qualities same as C. prunulus. Delicious.


=C. pascuen´sis= Pk.—pasture. =Pileus= fleshy, compact, centrally
depressed, _glabrous, reddish or pale yellowish_, the cuticle of the
disk cracking into minute areas. =Gills= rather narrow, close,
decurrent, whitish, becoming flesh-colored. =Stem= short, equal or
tapering downward, solid, glabrous, colored like the pileus. =Spores=
subelliptical, pale incarnate, 7.5–10×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 8–18 lines long, 4–6 lines thick.

Pastures. Saratoga county.

The species is related to C. prunulus from which it is distinct by its
shorter, paler spores, its glabrous pileus cracked in areas on the disk
and tinged with red or yellowish and by its paler gills. From C.
pseudo-orcella it differs in its glabrous pileus with no silky luster
and in its closer gills. Its odor is obsolete but it has a farinaceous
flavor. It is probably esculent, but has not been found in sufficient
quantity to afford a test of qualities. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=C. unitinct´us= Pk.—one-colored. =Pileus= thin, _submembranaceous_,
flexible, convex or nearly plane, centrally depressed or umbilicate,
glabrous, subshining, often concentrically rivulose, grayish or
grayish-brown. =Flesh= whitish or grayish-white, odor obsolete, taste
mild. =Gills= narrow, moderately close, _adnate or slightly decurrent_,
colored like the pileus. =Stem= slender, straight or flexuous,
subtenacious, equal, slightly pruinose, grayish-brown, with a close
white myceloid tomentum at the base and white root-like fibers of
mycelium permeating the soil. =Spores= elliptical, 7.5×5µ.

Var. _al´bidus_. Whitish or grayish-white, not rivulose. Gills broader.
Spores brownish flesh-color.

=Pileus= 6–16 lines broad. Stem about 1 in. long, 1 line thick.

Woods of pine or balsam. Albany and Essex counties. Autumn.

The variety is a little paler than the typical form, with gills a little
broader, but is probably not specifically distinct. _Peck_, 42d Rep.

=C. aborti´vus= B. and C.—abortive. (Plate LXIII, fig. 1, 2, 3, p. 254.)
=Pileus= fleshy, firm, convex or nearly plane, regular or irregular,
dry, _clothed with a minute silky tomentum_, becoming smooth with age,
gray or grayish-brown. =Flesh= _white_, taste and odor subfarinaceous.
=Gills= thin, close, slightly or deeply decurrent, at first whitish or
pale gray, then flesh-colored. =Stem= nearly equal, solid, minutely
flocculose, sometimes fibrous-striated, colored like or paler than the
pileus. =Spores= irregular, 7.5–10×6.5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Ground and old prostrate trunks of trees in woods and open places.
August and September.

Our species has been found to be edible, but its flavor is scarcely as
agreeable as that of some other species. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

It requires longer cooking than C. prunulus, and is then quite equal in
excellence.

The fungus is so named because of the abortive form of it frequently
found associated with it. This is faithfully portrayed on Plate LXIII.
This is in every way similar to the aborted forms of C. prunulus and
Armillaria mellea.

Both forms plentiful near Philadelphia. The undeveloped masses are also
similar to those of C. prunulus.

The abortive form is a superior edible to the original.


=C. popina´lis= Fr.—_popina_, a cook-shop. =Pileus= 1–2 in. across,
flesh thin, flaccid, convex then depressed, somewhat wavy, glabrous,
opaque, gray, spotted and marbled. =Flesh= grayish-white, unchangeable.
=Gills= very decurrent, broader than the thickness of the flesh of the
pileus, lanceolate, crowded, dark-gray, at length reddish from the
spores. =Stem= stuffed, 1–2 in. long, 2 lines thick, equal, often
flexuous, naked, paler than the pileus. =Spores= subglobose, slightly
angular, 4–5µ _Massee_.

Solitary or gregarious, smell pleasant like new meal, entirely gray.

narrow zones on the margin, odor farinaceous. =Gills= narrow, close,
adnate or slightly decurrent, gray, becoming flesh-colored. =Stem=
_short_, solid, slightly thickened at the top, pruinose, gray with a
white mycelium at the base. =Spores= angular or irregular, 10×6µ.

=Pileus= 6–12 lines broad. =Stem= 8–10 lines long, 1 line thick.

Thin woods. Essex and Rensselaer counties. August.

This species is closely allied to the preceding one, but may be
separated from it by its short stem and silky umbilicate subzonate
pileus. Both species are rare and have been observed only in wet, rainy
weather. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=C. subvi´lis= Pk.—small value. =Pileus= thin, centrally depressed or
umbilicate, with the margin decurved, hygrophanous, _dark-brown_ and
striatulate on the margin when moist, grayish-brown and silky shining
when dry, taste farinaceous. =Gills= _subdistant_, adnate or slightly
decurrent, whitish when young, then flesh-colored. =Stem= slender,
brittle, rather long, _stuffed or hollow_, glabrous, colored like the
pileus or a little paler. =Spores= angular, 7.5–10µ.

=Pileus= 8–15 lines broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 1–2 lines thick.

Damp soil in thin woods. Albany county. October.

The species is allied to C. vilis, from which it is separated by its
silky-shining pileus, subdistant gills and farinaceous taste. _Peck_,

or flexuous. =Gills= close, adnate or slightly decurrent, whitish, then
flesh-colored. =Stem= equal, flexuous, shining, _solid_, colored like
the pileus. =Spores= subglobose, angular, 6–7.5µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 2 lines thick.

Ground and decayed prostrate trunks in woods. Lewis county. September.

This species is perhaps too closely allied to the preceding, but it may
easily be separated by its paler color, closer gills and solid stem,
though this is sometimes hollow from the erosion of insects. _Peck_, 42d

                            SPORES ROSY-RED.


=C. erythro´sporus= Pk. _Gr_—red-spored. =Pileus= thin, hemispherical or
strongly convex, glabrous or merely pruinose, pinkish-gray. =Flesh=
whitish tinged with pink, taste farinaceous. =Gills= narrow, crowded,
arcuate, _deeply decurrent_, colored like the pileus. =Stem= equal or
slightly tapering upward, hollow, slightly pruinose at the top, _colored
like the pileus_. =Spores= elliptical, 5×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–1.5 in. long, 2–3 lines thick.

Decayed wood and among fallen leaves in woods. Albany and Ulster
counties. September and October.

The species is easily recognized by its peculiar uniform color, its
narrow, crowded and generally very decurrent gills and by its bright
rosy-red spores. Sometimes individuals occur in which the gills are less
decurrent. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., among fallen leaves. Sparsely gregarious. September to
November. _McIlvaine._

Edible, good.


=C. conis´sans= Pk.—dusted. =Pileus= thin, convex, glabrous, pale
alutaceous, often _dusted by the copious spores_. =Gills= close,
_adnate_, reddish-brown. =Stem= slender, brittle, hollow, cespitose,
_white_. =Spores= narrowly elliptical, 7.5×4µ.

=Pileus= 1–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 1–2 lines thick.

Base of an apple tree. Catskill mountains. September.

Remarkable for the bright rosy-red spores which are sometimes so thickly
dusted over the lower pilei of a tuft as to conceal their real color.
The species is very rare. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


             SPORES VERY PALE FLESH-COLORED, MERELY TINTED.

=C. cæspito´sus= Pk.—tufted. =Pileus= at first convex, firm, nearly
regular, shining, white, then nearly plane, fragile, often irregular or
eccentric, glabrous but with a slight silky luster, _even_, whitish.
=Flesh= white, _taste_ mild. =Gills= narrow, thin, crowded, often
forked, adnate or slightly decurrent, whitish, becoming dingy or
brownish-pink. =Stems= _cespitose_, solid, silky-fibrillose, slightly
mealy at the top, white. =Spores= 5×4µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Thin woods and pastures. Ulster county. September.

This is a large, fine species, very distinct by its cespitose habit,
white color and very pale sordid-tinted spores. But for the color of
these the plant might easily be taken for a species of Clitocybe. The
tufts sometimes form long rows. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. October. _McIlvaine._

Tender, not much flavor.


=C. Noveboracen´sis= Pk.—New York Clitopilus. =Pileus= thin, convex,
then expanded or slightly depressed, dingy white, _cracked in areas or
concentrically rivulose_, sometimes obscurely zonate, odor farinaceous,
_taste bitter_. =Gills= narrow, close, deeply decurrent, some of them
forked, white, becoming dingy, tinged with yellow or flesh-color. =Stem=
equal, solid, colored like the pileus, the mycelium white, often forming
white branching root-like fibers. =Spores= globose, 4–5µ broad.

Var. _brevis_. Margin of the pileus, in the moist plant, pure white.
=Gills= adnate or slightly decurrent. =Stem= short.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 1–3 lines thick.

Woods and pastures. Adirondack mountains, Albany and Rensselaer
counties. August to October.

The plant is gregarious or cespitose. Sometimes, especially in the
variety, it grows in lines or arcs of circles. The margin is often
undulated, and in the variety it is, when fresh and moist, clothed with
a film of interwoven webby white fibrils which give it a peculiar
appearance, and if the spore characters are neglected it might be
mistaken for Clitocybe phyllophila. The disk is often tinged with
reddish-yellow or rusty hues when moist, and its rivulose character is
then more distinct. A farinaceous odor is generally present, especially
in the broken or bruised plant, but its taste is bitter and unpleasant.
Sometimes bruises of the fresh plant manifest a tendency to assume a
smoky-brown or blackish color. The base of the stem is sometimes clothed
with a white mycelioid tomentum. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=C. Sey´mourianus= Pk.—=Pileus= fleshy, thin, broadly convex or slightly
depressed, even, _pruinose, whitish with a dark lilac tinge_, sometimes
lobed and eccentric. =Gills= narrow, crowded, decurrent, some of them
forked at the base, whitish with a pale flesh-colored tint. =Stem=
equal, silky-fibrillose, _hollow_. =Spores= minute, globose or nearly
so, 3.5–4µ long.

readily separating. _Fries._

The Leptoniæ are related to the Clitopili as the Collybiæ are to the
Clitocybæ. The species are small, elegant, brightly colored, inodorous
(except A. incanus), and abound _in rainy weather_. Gregarious or
growing in troops; on the ground, commonly on dry mossy pastures, but
also in marshy places. _Stevenson._

somewhat papillate, striate and sometimes even, sometimes also clothed
with flocci, _margin straight and at the first pressed to the stem_, and
not involute. =Gills= free or adfixed, and not decurrent. _Fries_.

Nolanea agrees with Leptonia and Eccilia among the pink-spored species.
It corresponds with Mycena, Galera and Psathyra. Several Entolomata are
nearly allied. The species are thin and slender, commonly inodorous and
fragile, though some of them are tough. Growing on the ground in summer
and autumn. _Stevenson._

=Stem= _cartilaginous_, tubular (the tube hollow or stuffed), expanded
upward into the _pileus_, which is somewhat membranaceous and at the
first turned inward at the margin. =Gills= attenuated behind, truly
decurrent, becoming more so when the pileus is depressed, and not
separating as those of Nolanea.

Corresponding in structure with Omphalia of the white-spored and Tubaria
of the brown-spored series. Allied to Clitopilus in the decurrent gills,
but separated by the cartilaginous, smooth stem.

=Pileus= eccentric, lateral or resupinate. =Spores= pinkish.

The species of this genus were formerly distributed among the Pleuroti
and Crepidoti, which they resemble in all respects except the color of
the spores. The genus at first was made to include species with
lilac-colored as well as pink spores, but Professor Fries limited it to
species with pink spores. In this sense we have taken it. The spores in
some species are even, in others rough or angulated. The stem is either
entirely wanting or is very short and inconspicuous, a character
indicated by the generic name. The pileus often rests upon its back and
is attached by a point when young, but it becomes turned backward with
age. The species are few and infrequent. All inhabit decaying wood.

=C. ni´dulans= Pers.—_nidus_, a nest. =Pileus= 1–3 in. broad, stemless,
attached by the pileus or rarely narrowed behind into a short stem-like
base, caps often overlapping one another, suborbicular or kidney-shaped,
_downy_, somewhat pointed-hairy or scaly-hairy toward the margin,
_yellow or buff color_, the margin at first turned inward. =Lamellæ=
rather broad, moderately close or subdistant, _orange-yellow_. =Spores=
even, slightly curved, 6–8µ long, about half as broad, delicate pink.

Decaying wood. Sandlake. Catskill and Adirondack mountains. Autumn.

This fungus was placed by Fries among the Pleuroti, and in this he has
been followed by most authors. But the spores have a delicate pink color
closely resembling that of the young lamellæ of the common mushroom,
Agaricus campestris. We have, therefore, placed it among the
Claudopodes, where Fries himself has suggested it should be placed if
removed at all from Pleurotus. Our plant has sometimes been referred to
Panus dorsalis Bosc., but with the description of that species it does
not well agree. The tawny-color, spoon-shaped pileus, pale floccose
scales, short lateral stem and decurrent lamellæ ascribed to that
species are not well shown by our plant. The substance of the pileus,
though rather tenacious and persistent, can scarcely be called leathery.
The flesh is white or pale yellow. The hairy down of the pileus is often
matted in small tufts and intermingled with coarse hairs, especially
toward the margin. This gives a scaly or pointed-hairy appearance. The
color of the pileus is often paler toward the base than it is on the
margin. _Peck_, 39th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., November, 1898, decaying stumps. _McIlvaine._

An autumnal species growing upon wood. Not common.

The light yellow tomentosity of the cap arranges itself into shapes as
fascinating as crystals of snow.

Taste pleasant, mild. Texture more solid than P. ostreatus, consequently
tougher. It is edible but not desirable. Must be chopped fine and cooked
well.

          _Series III._ =OCHRO´SPORÆ= (Dermini). Spores brown.

Ochrosporæ, third in color series, ranges in spore color from dull
ochraceous, through bright ocher, to rusty orange and ferruginous or
iron-rust. The various shades will tax even a color expert.

There are no species in the series corresponding to Amanitæ. In
Acetabularia there is a cup-like volva; in Pholiota there is a distinct
interwoven ring on the stem; in Cortinarius the secondary veil is like a
cobweb, and may form an imperfect zone around the stem, or hang as
fibers from the margin of the cap; Pluteolus exactly resembles Pluteus.

There are many edible species of good quality in the series. None are
known to be poisonous. The substance, as a rule, is tougher than in most
of the preceding genera, and in many instances has a strong woody
flavor. Several species are late growers, and are among the best of
fungi. Notably in Pholiota.




                         =ACETABULA´RIA= Berk.

         _Acetabulum_, a vinegar-cup. From the cup-like volva.


Universal veil distinct from the pileus; hymenophore distinct; gills
free; spores pallid, tawny or brown.

Analogous to Volvaria and Chitonia.

No American species reported.

                            =PHOLIO´TA= Fr.

                             _Gr_—a scale.


=Pileus= more or less fleshy. =Gills= adnate, with or without a
decurrent tooth, tawny or rust colored at maturity from the spores.
=Flesh= of stem continuous with that of the pileus. =Ring= distinct,
interwoven. =Spores= sepia-brown, bright yellowish-brown or light red.

Generally on wood, sometimes on the ground in damp moss, frequently
densely cespitose. Some of the species are large and bright colored.
Distinguished from all other genera of the brown-spored series by the
possession of a distinct ring. In Cortinarius the veil and ring are
web-like.

Stevenson notes in his description of the genus: “None are to be
commended as edible.” My investigation shows that there are several
delicious species, notably P. squarrosa and subsquarrosa. Their lateness
and plentifulness make them valuable food fungi. I have nothing but
praise for the entire genus.

=P. capera´ta= Pers.—_capero_, to wrinkle. (Plate LXXI, fig. 2, page
268.) =Pileus= 3–5 in. broad, more or less intensely yellow, fleshy, but
thin in proportion to its size and robust stem, ovate then expanded,
obtuse, viscid only when moist and not truly so, even at the disk,
wrinkled in pits at the sides, _incrusted with white superficial
flocci_. =Stem= 4–6 in. long, more than 1 in. thick, solid, stout,
cylindrical with exception of the base which is often tuberous, shining
white, _scaly above the ring, which is membranaceous, reflexo-pendulous,
and broken into squamules at the apex_. =Gills= adnate, crowded, thin,
somewhat serrated, _clay_-cinnamon.

When young the pileus is incrusted with the veil or with white
mealy-floccose soft, hairy down, which is crowded on the even disk and
scaly towards the thin pitted-furrowed margin; and as this separates the
pileus is naked. Veil universal, floccoso-mealy, at the first cohering
in the form of a volva but not continuous; in rainy weather remaining in
the form of a volva at the base. =Spores= dark ferruginous on a white
ground, paler on a black ground. There is a smaller form (A. macropus
Pers.) in pine woods, pileus even and paler. =Stem= 3 in. long, and
without a tuberous base. =Ring= oblique and often incomplete. _Stev._

=Spores= 10µ _B. and Br._; 12×4µ _W.P._; spheroid-ellipsoid, uniguttate,
11–12×8–9µ _K._; 12×4.5µ _Massee_.

Not previously reported.

This fungus occurs sparingly in rich woods near Boston. It is much
esteemed in Germany, and eagerly sought by the common people, who call
it familiarly the “Zigeuner” (Gypsy). Boston Myc. Club Bull. 1896.

I have found this species in but one place—on the south hill of the
great Chester valley, Pa., where it grows plentifully in woods. The
taste raw was slightly acrid, but when cooked this disappeared. Many ate
of the species and enjoyed it.


=P. togula´ris= Bull.—_togula_, a little cloak. From the ample ring.
=Pileus= 1½ in. broad, _pallid ochraceous_, fleshy, soft, bell-shaped
then expanded, obtuse, orbicular, _without striæ_, smooth. =Flesh= thin,
soft, becoming yellow. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 2 lines thick, tubed, rigid,
equal, cylindrical, rough with stiff fibers, naked and becoming yellow
at the apex, becoming dingy brown downward. =Ring= medial, more than 1
in. distant, entire, spreading-reflexed. =Gills= adnato-separating,
ventricose, crowded, narrowed in front, becoming yellow, at length pale
rust-color, never becoming dingy brown.

Protean, slender, very variable in stature, growing in troops. _b._ More
slender, but densely gregarious, with the wholly pallid smooth stem
thinner, often flexuous. This form is exactly A. mesodactylus Berk. _c._
Very small. Pileus 1 in. =Stem= 1 in. or a little more, scarcely 1 line
thick, very flexuous, becoming rust-color. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptical, 8×3.5µ _Massee_.

New Jersey, on decayed chips mixed with dirt. May, 1898. _E.B.
Sterling._

Not previously reported.

The specimens sent were tested and found to be of good quality.


      ** Phæ´oti. _Spores fuscous—ferruginous (dingy rust-color)._


=P. du´ra= Bolt.—_durus_, hard. =Pileus= 3 in. and more broad, tawny,
tan-color, becoming dingy brown, fleshy, _somewhat compact_,
convexo-plane, obtuse, smooth, _then cracked into patches_, margin even.
=Stem= commonly curt, 2 in. long, about ½ in. thick, _stuffed_, even
solid, hard, becoming silky-even, then longitudinally cracked when dry,
thickened at the _apex, mealy_ and more than usually widened into the
pileus, varying ventricose and irregularly-shaped. =Ring= _torn_.
=Gills= _adnate_, striato-decurrent with a tooth, ventricose, ½ in.
broad, _livid then dingy rust-color_.

The stem is abundantly furnished with fibrillose rootlets at the base.
Although very closely allied to A. præcox, it is readily distinguished
by its rust-color or brown-rust spores. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 9×5µ _W.G.S._; 8–9×5–6µ _Massee_.

Haddonfield, N.J. June to October. Florist’s garden, _McIlvaine_.

After rains P. dura appears, solitary, from spring to autumn. The
cracked cap, in mature specimens, distinguishes it from other species
found on its habitat. It varies in size from 1½ in. up to 4 in. across.
The caps are excellent.


(Plate LXXII.)

[Illustration:

  PHOLIOTA PRÆCOX.
  After Peck.
]

=P. præ´cox= Pers.—_præcox_, early. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad, convex or
nearly plane, soft, nearly or quite glabrous, whitish, more or less
tinged with yellow or tan-color. =Gills= close, adnexed, at first
whitish, then brownish or rusty-brownish. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 2–2.5
lines thick, rather slender, mealy or glabrous, stuffed or hollow,
whitish. =Spores= elliptical, rusty-brown, 10–13×6–8µ.

The Early Pholiota is a small but variable species. From other similarly
colored species that appear in grassy ground early in the season, the
collar on the stem will generally distinguish it. Its cap is usually
convex when young but nearly flat in the mature plant. It is rather pale
in color but not a clear white, being tinted with yellow or pale
tan-colored hues. The gills are whitish when the cap first opens, but
they soon change to a rusty-brown hue in consequence of the ripening of
the spores. They are excavated at the inner extremity and slightly
attached to the stem. They are ventricose when the cap is fully
expanded. The stem is rather slender, nearly or quite straight and soon
smooth and hollow. It is pale or whitish, and usually furnished with a
small collar. Sometimes the collar is slight and disappears with age and
sometimes the fragments of the veil remain attached to the margin of the
cap leaving nothing for a collar.

The plants usually grow in grassy ground, lawns and gardens, and appear
from May to July.

Var. _minor_ Batt. is a small form having the cap only about 1 in. broad
and the remnants of the veil adherent to the margin of the cap. It is
represented by figures 6 to 12.

Var. _sylvestris_ Pk. has the center of the cap brownish or rusty-brown,
and grows in thin woods. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= inclining to fuscous, spheroid-ellipsoid, 8–13×5–7µ _K._; 8×6µ
_W.G.S._; 8–13×6–7µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, May to August.
On rich ground, lawns, gardens, etc. _McIlvaine._

Coming as it does in early spring, it is a prized species wherever
found.

The caps only are good.

  PHOLIOTA SQUARROSA.
  One-half natural size.
]

=P. squarro´sa= Mull.—_squarrosus_, scurfy. (Plate LXXI, fig. 3, page
268.) =Pileus= 3–5 in. broad, saffron-rust-color, scaly with _innate,
crowded, revolute, darker_ (becoming dingy brown), persistent _scales_,
fleshy, convex bell-shaped then flattened, commonly obtusely umbonate or
gibbous, dry. =Flesh= light-yellow, compact when young, sometimes thin.
=Stems= curt when young, as much as 8 in. long when full-grown, as much
as 1 in. thick at the apex, remarkably attenuated downwards, stuffed,
scaly as far as the ring with crowded, revolute, darker scales. =Ring=
only slightly distant from the apex, rarely membranaceous, entire or
often slashed, generally floccoso-radiate, of the same color as the
scales. =Gills= adnate with a decurrent tooth, crowded, narrow,
_pallid-olivaceous_ then rust-color.

=Spores= ferruginous. Very cespitose, forming large heaps. Stems
commonly cohering at the base, varying very much in stature in the same
cluster; varying also much thinner, scarcely ever curved-ascending. Odor
heavy, stinking; sometimes, however, obsolete. _Stevenson._

=Spores= ellipsoid, 7–8x4–5µ _K._; 4x5µ _W.G.S._; 8x4µ _Massee_.

On trunks of trees, on and near stumps, etc. Common. August to December.

West Virginia, 1881–1885, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. On rotten wood and
stumps. August to long after frost. _McIlvaine._

Edible. _Curtis._

The American species, as I have repeatedly found it, is not so large as
given in the European description, and the habitat is more closely
confined to the trunks of standing trees and stumps not much decayed. It
is a showy species, to be seen from afar off, especially after the
leaves fall. Taste when young, raw, is sweet, mealy; when mature, like
stale lard.

Cooked, the caps are of good substance and flavor. One of the very best.


=P. squarrosoi´des= Pk.—_squarrosus_, scurfy; _eidos_, form. =Pileus=
firm, convex, viscid when moist, at first densely covered by erect
papillose or subspinose tawny scales, which soon separate from each
other, revealing the whitish color and viscid character of the pileus.
=Lamellæ= close, emarginate, at first whitish, then pallid or dull
cinnamon color. =Stem= equal, firm, stuffed, rough with thick squarrose
scales, white above the thick floccose ring, pallid or tawny below.
=Spores= minute, elliptical, 5×4µ.

Densely cespitose, 3–6 in. high. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5
lines thick.

Dead trunks and old stumps of maple. Adirondack and Catskill mountains.
Autumn.

This is evidently closely related to A. squarrosus, with which it has,
perhaps, been confused, but its different colors and viscid pileus
appear to warrant its separation. _Peck_, 31st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Occurred in large clusters on sugar maples at Eagle’s Mere in October,
and on stumps at Mt. Gretna. It very closely resembles P. squarrosa. Its
caps are of the very best.


=P. subsquarro´sa= Fr.—_sub_, under; _squarrosus_, scurfy. (Plate LXXI,
fig. 4, p. 268.) =Pileus= 2 in. and more broad, _brown rust-color_, with
darker, _adpressed_, floccose _scales_, fleshy, convex, obtuse or
gibbous, viscid. =Stem= 3 in. long, 4–5 lines thick, stuffed (often
hollow when old), equal, yellow-rust-color, clothed with darker scales
which are adpressed, or spreading only at the apex, not rough, furnished
with an annular zone at the apex, becoming yellow-rust-color within.
=Gills= deeply sinuate, emarginate, _almost free_, arcuate, crowded, at
first pale then dingy yellow.

=Spores= rust-color. The pileus is viscid, but not glutinous like that
of A. adiposus. It holds a doubtful place between A. aurivellus and A.
squarrosus, departing from both, however, in the gills being at the
first yellow; and from A. squarrosus, to which it is more like, in the
gills being emarginato-free, not decurrent. Somewhat cespitose. Almost
inodorous. _Fries._

=Spores= ferruginous, size not stated.

West Philadelphia, Mt. Gretna, Pa., Haddonfield, N.J. September until
after frosts. _McIlvaine._

Not previously reported.

The maple trees in West Philadelphia frequently show large clusters of
it up to twenty feet from ground; to be seen from afar after the leaves
have fallen. Our American species differs somewhat from the European.
American species:

=Pileus= 1–3 in. across, fleshy, convex, _very viscid_, rich
brownish-yellow, covered with darker adpressed floccose scales. =Flesh=
slightly yellow. =Gills= white when very young slightly emarginate,
adnexed, crowded, ¼ in. broad, brown. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, ½ in. thick,
equal or tapering toward base, stuffed, then hollow, covered with
squamose scales as far up as the slight ring, smooth above ring. =Ring=
membranaceous, slight.

=Spores= rust-color.

The species is variable and differs greatly in youth and maturity.

The caps, fried in hot buttered pan, are unexcelled.

Equally fine in croquettes and patties.

                  ** _Gills yellow, then rust-color._


(Plate LXXIV.)

[Illustration:

  PHOLIOTA ADIPOSA.
  About natural size.
]

=P. adipo´sa= Fr.—_adeps_, fat. =Pileus= fleshy, firm, at first
hemispherical or subconical, then convex, very viscid or glutinous when
moist, scaly, yellow. =Flesh= whitish. =Gills= close, adnate, yellowish
becoming rust-color with age. =Stem= equal or slightly thickened at the
base, scaly below the slight radiating floccose ring, solid or stuffed,
yellow, generally rust-color at the base. =Spores= elliptical, 7.6×5µ.

The Fat pholiota is a showy species. Its tufted mode of growth, rather
large size, yellow color and rusty-brown scales make it a noticeable
object. The stem is somewhat and the cap very viscid when moist, and
this viscidity when dry gives it a shining appearance. The scales of the
cap become erect or reflexed and sometimes appear blackish at the tips.
They sometimes disappear with age. The flesh is firm and white or
whitish. The gills when young are yellow or pale-yellow, but when mature
they assume a ferruginous or rusty color like that of the spores. The
stem is similar in color to the cap, but paler or nearly white at the
top and usually reddish-brown or rusty-brown at the base. The collar is
slight and often scarcely noticeable in mature specimens.

The =Cap= is 2–4 in. broad, the =Stem= 2–4 in. long and 4–6 lines thick.
The plants commonly grow in tufts on stumps or dead trunks of deciduous
trees in or near woods. They may be found from September to November. It
is well to peel the caps before cooking. This species is not classed as
edible by European authors, but I find its flavor agreeable and its
substance digestible and harmless. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 8×5µ _W.G.S._; elliptical, ferruginous, 7×3µ _Massee_.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. October until after frost. About trees and stumps and on
logs. _McIlvaine._

P. adiposa yields a substantial substance of good flavor.


=P. flam´mans= Fr.—_flamma_, flame. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad,
yellow-tawny, fleshy, convex then plane, somewhat umbonate, _absolutely
dry_, sprinkled with _superficial, pilose_, somewhat concentric, _paler_
or _sulphur-yellow, rough_ or curly _scales_; margin at first inflexed,
then spread when larger. =Flesh= thin, _light yellow_. =Stem= 3 in.
long, 2–3 lines thick, stuffed then _hollow, equal_, most frequently
flexuous, _very light yellow as are also the crowded rough scales_.
=Ring= membranaceous, entire, not far removed from the pileus, of the
same color. =Gills= _adnate_ and without a tooth, somewhat thin,
crowded, at the first _bright sulphur-yellow_, at length rust-color,
edge quite entire.

Pileus by no means hygrophanous. It is distinguished from all others by
the _sulphur-yellow scales on the tawny pileus_. Forming small clusters.
Inodorous. The ring is sometimes only indicated by an annular zone.
_Fries._

=Spores= ellipsoid, 4×2µ _K._; ellipsoid, 3–4×2–2.5µ _C.B.P._; 4×2µ
_W.P._; 8×4µ _Massee_.

Quite plentiful in the New Jersey pines, from October until after heavy
frosts. Caps seldom over 3 in. across. Solitary, and in clusters of not
over half a dozen.

The caps fried are delicious.


=P. luteofo´lia= Pk.—_luteus_, yellow; _folium_, a leaf. =Pileus= firm,
convex, dry, scaly, fibrillose on the margin, pale-red or yellowish.
=Lamellæ= broad, subdistant, emarginate, serrate on the edge, yellow,
becoming bright rust-color. =Stem= firm, fibrillose, solid, colored like
the pileus, often curved from the place of growth. =Ring= obsolete.
=Spores= bright rust-color, 7×4µ.

=Plant= subcespitose, 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5
lines thick.

Trunks of birch trees. Forestburgh. September.

The general appearance of this plant is like A. variegatus or reddish
forms of A. multipunctus. The reddish color appears sometimes to fade
with age. _Peck_, 27th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Eagle’s Mere, Pa. In clusters, on birch trees. August, 1898.
_McIlvaine._

Grows in quantity in the birch forests. The caps are delicious.


=P. ornel´la= Pk. (Agaricus ornellus Pk., 34 Rep., p. 42.) =Pileus=
convex or nearly plane, slightly squamose, reddish-brown tinged with
purple, the margin paler, floccose-appendiculate. =Gills= moderately
close, yellowish or pallid, becoming brown. =Stem= equal or slightly
thickened upward, solid, squamulose, pale-yellow, sometimes expanded at
the base into a brownish disk margined with yellowish filaments.
=Spores= brown, elliptical, 6–7.5×4–5µ.

=Plant= 1–2 in. high. =Pileus= about 1 in. broad. =Stem= 1 line to 1.5
lines thick.

Decaying wood. South Ballston, Saratoga county. October.

The scales of the pileus are sometimes arranged in concentric circles.
The purplish tint is not always uniform, but in some instances forms
spots or patches. _Peck_, 34th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Specimens, clustered, found by me on railroad ties at Haddonfield, N.J.,
September, 1897, had caps 1–1½ in. broad, of a dull green without tinge
of purple; skin minutely cracked, showing the white flesh in the
interstices; stem 1–2 in. long, 3–4 lines thick, slightly thickened
upward, pale orange, solid, squamulose; ring floccose; taste when raw,
slightly bitter. These were sent to Professor Peck who wrote: “Appears
to be a form of P. ornella Pk., but it differs some in color, being more
of a green hue than of purple or olivaceous. It is pretty and I would
like to know more about it before deciding on it fully.”

I have not since found it. Very palatable when cooked.

                 *** Hygrophani. _Gills cinnamon, etc._


=P. muta´bilis= Schaeff.—changeable. =Pileus= about 2 in. broad,
cinnamon when moist, becoming pale when dry, hygrophanous, slightly
fleshy, convex then flattened, commonly obtusely umbonate, sometimes
depressed, even and _smooth_, but when young occasionally scaly
throughout. =Stem= about 2–3 in. long, 2 lines and more thick, _rigid_,
stuffed then hollow, equal or attenuated downward, _scaly-rough as far
as the ring, rust-color, blackish_ or umber _downward_, often ascending
or twisted. =Ring= membranaceous, externally scaly. =Gills=
_adnato-decurrent_, crowded, rather broad, pallid then cinnamon.
_Stevenson._

Densely cespitose, variable in stature.

=Spores= ellipsoid-obovate, 6×11µ _W.G.S._; 7×4µ _W.P_; 9–11×5–6µ
_Massee_; 11×7µ _Morgan_.

Edible. _Curtis._ Considered excellent in Europe.


=P. margina´ta= Batsch.—_marginatus_, margined. =Pileus= 1 in. and more
broad, honey-colored when moist, tan when dry, hygrophanous, slightly
fleshy, convex then expanded, obtuse, even, _smooth_, margin striate.
=Stem= about 2 in. long, 1–2 lines thick, _tubed_, equal, _fibrillose_
or slightly striate, _not scaly, of the same color as the pileus_, but
becoming dingy-brown, and _commonly white velvety at the base_. =Ring=
1–2 lines distant from the apex, often in the form of a cortina and
fugacious. =Gills= _adnate_, crowded, thin, _narrow_, at first pallid,
then darker cinnamon.

It varies much, and is deceptive on account of the vanishing veil. In
hedges there is a very small cespitose form with the pileus only ½ in.
broad, and the stem tough and smooth, with exception of the remains of
the fugacious cortina. There also occur on the ground among mosses
smaller and paler forms, which must be carefully distinguished from A.
unicolor, etc. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 7–8×4µ _Massee_.

Haddonfield, N.J., November, December, 1896. In pine woods. _McIlvaine._

The caps of this small Pholiota, seldom over 1 ½ in. across, can be
gathered in goodly numbers where it frequents. They are of excellent
quality.


=P. dis´color= Pk.—changing color. =Pileus= thin, convex, then expanded
or slightly depressed, smooth, viscid, hygrophanous, watery-cinnamon and
striatulate on the margin when moist; bright ochraceous-yellow when dry.
=Lamellæ= close, narrow, pallid then pale rust-color. =Stem= equal,
hollow, fibrillose-striate, pallid. =Ring= distinct, persistent.
=Spores= elliptical, 7×5µ.

=Plant= subcespitose, 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 8–16 lines broad. =Stem= 1
line thick.

Old logs in woods. Greig. September.

The change of color from the moist to the dry state is very marked. This
species resembles Agaricus autumnalis, in which the annulus is fugacious
and the spores are longer. The edge of the gills in both is
white-flocculose. _Peck_, 25th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Two forms of this species are found. One has a scattered form of growth,
the other found on decaying wood of birch is cespitose. The species is
allied to P. marginata, from which it is readily distinguished by its
viscid pileus. _Peck_, Rep. 44.

Var. _discolor minor_ Pk. Small. Pileus 6–10 lines broad, chestnut color
when young or moist. Stem about 1 line thick, at first clothed with
whitish fibrils.

Among mosses about or on the base of stumps. September. _Peck_, Rep. 46.

West Virginia. Eagle’s Mere, Mt. Gretna, Pa. August to frost. On
decaying wood. _McIlvaine._

This little Pholiota is abundant where it does grow. In the West
Virginia forests I have seen logs with many tufts of it upon each. The
caps are fairly good.

  INOCYBE LANUGINOSA.

Universal veil somewhat fibrillose, concrete with the cuticle of the
pileus, often free at the margin, in the form of a cortina. =Gills=
somewhat sinuate (but they occur also adnate and in two species
decurrent), changing color, but not powdered with cinnamon. =Spores=
often rough, but in others even, more or less brownish-rust color.

Inocybe (with Hebeloma) corresponds with Tricholoma. Inocybe and
Hebeloma have some common features, but they are really very distinct.
Inocybe is readily distinguished by the fibrillose covering of the
pileus, which never has a distinct pellicle, by the veil which is
continuous and homogeneous with the fibrils of the pileus, and by the
rusty-brown spores. All grow on the ground. They are (mostly)
strong-smelling (commonly nauseous). None are edible. _Stevenson._

None reported as either edible or poisonous. Those I have tested are not
pleasant.

                       Dim. of _pluteus_, a shed.


=Pileus= conical or bell-shaped, then expanded, rather fleshy, viscid,
margin at first straight and pressed to the stem. =Gills= _free, rounded
behind_. =Stem= somewhat cartilaginous, its substance different from
that of the pileus.

Growing on wood.

=Spores= rust or saffron color. Pluteus, the only genus having the same
structure, is separated by its salmon-colored spores.

=P. reticula´tus= Pers.—_rete_, a net. From the net-work of veins on the
pileus. =Pileus= slightly fleshy, bell-shaped, then expanded, sticky,
reticulate with anastomosing veins, pale violaceous, striate on the
margin. =Lamellæ= free, ventricose, crowded, rusty-saffron. =Stem=
hollow, fragile, fibrillose, mealy at the top, white. =Spores=
elliptical, ferruginous, 10–13×5–6.5µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 1–2 lines thick.

Decaying wood. Cattaraugus county. September.

The specimens which I have referred to this species appear to be a small
form with the pileus scarcely more than an inch broad and merely
wrinkled on the disk, not distinctly reticulate as in the type. In the
dried specimens the pileus has assumed a dark violaceous color. The
dimensions of the spores have been taken from the American plant. I do
not find them given by any European author. _Peck_, 46th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

In October, 1897, P. reticulatus grew in large quantities on a fallow
lot close by the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. The lot was
thickly covered with tall heavy-stemmed weeds, a mat of which, from the
year before was present. The reticulations upon the cap are intricate
and distinct. I have not seen it since.

The whole plant is tender and of fine flavor.

                     _Hebe_, youth; _loma_, fringe.


Partial veil fibrillose or absent. =Pileus= smooth, continuous, somewhat
viscid, margin at first incurved. Flesh of stem continuous with that of
the pileus; fleshy, fibrous, clothed, top rather mealy. =Gills=
attached, notched at the stem, edge inclined to be pale. =Spores=
clay-colored.

On the ground.

Closely allied to Inocybe, formerly included in Hebeloma, but differing
in the character of the cuticle of the pileus which in Inocybe is scaly
or fibrillose. Many of the species are strong in smell and taste. None
have hitherto been considered edible and some have been regarded as
poisonous.

The writer has not as yet investigated the edible qualities of this
genus to his satisfaction. Much work remains to be done. But two species
of Hebeloma are given as edible. They are good, but do not rank above
second-class. Several others have been tested, but not in sufficient
quantity to report upon their quality with perfect safety. So far as
tested the species have been harmless.


                     INDUSIA´TI. With a ring, etc.


=H. mus´sivum= Fr.—_mussivus_, undecided. (Uncertain in generic place.)
=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, either of one color, yellow or darker at the
disk which is like a smooth sugar-cake, fleshy, _compact_, firm, convex
then plane, unequal, very obtuse, viscid, at first _smooth_ and even,
margin bent inward, even, then commonly turning upward and broken up
into scales. =Flesh= thick, becoming yellow. =Stem= 4 in. long, commonly
1 in. thick, _very fleshy_, sometimes stuffed, sometimes hollow at the
top, equal or broad in the middle, _wholly fibrillose and powdered at
the top, light yellow_. =Veil= fibrillose, very evanescent. =Gills=
emarginate, somewhat crowded, 3 lines broad, dry (not distilling drops),
_at first light yellow_, then together with the spores somewhat
rust-colored.

Odor weak, not unpleasant. Very distinct. It departs widely from all the
following species in its habit and bright colors. The habit is that of a
Flammula or Cortinarius, but the gills are emarginate and not powdered;
from the turned up pileus and from the stem being powdered at the top,
and from other marks it is to be referred to Hebeloma. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, 12×6µ _Massee_.

New Jersey, Haddonfield. Under pine trees. Solitary. Frequent.
September, 1896. _McIlvaine._

Not previously reported.

Taste, even raw, is pleasant. It is meaty and the meat is good. It
requires slow cooking and is best chopped fine and served in patties or
croquettes.

=H. fasti´bile= Fr.—_fastidibilis_, loathsome. From the smell. =Pileus=
2 in. and more broad, pale yellowish, tan or becoming pale, compactly
fleshy, convexo-plane, obtuse, somewhat wavy, even, smooth, the
turned-in margin downy. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, ½ in. thick, _solid_,
wholly fleshy-fibrous, stout, somewhat bulbous, often twisted,
everywhere _white-silky and fibrillose_, white, but varying pallid,
white-scaly upward. =Cortina= remarkable, white, occasionally in the
form of a ring. =Gills= remarkably _emarginate, somewhat distant_,
rather broad, at first becoming pale-white, then dingy clay-color, edge
whitish, _distilling drops_ in rainy weather.

Somewhat cespitose. Odor and taste of radish, bitterish. Like A.
crustiliniformis; the odor is the same except that it is stronger, but
it differs conspicuously _in the manifest veil and somewhat distant
gills_.

Var. _al´ba_, stem longer, equal, somewhat hollow, fibrous-scaly at the
apex, gills distant. A. spiloleucus Krombh., A. sulcatus Lindgr. is an
elegant form with the margin of the pileus sulcate or rugoso-plicate.

In mixed woods. Common. July to October. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 11×8µ _W.G.S._; elliptical, pointed, 10×8µ _Morgan_.

Var. _elegans_. Pileus purple-brown.

This sometimes appears on disused mushroom beds in large quantities, but
the method by which the spores gain access is involved in darkness.

“A very suspicious species and has the reputation of being noxious.”
_Cooke._

“There is considerable external resemblance between this and A.
campestris. No fungus is so often mistaken for A. campestris as this
dangerous plant.” _W.G. Smith._

This species is considered noxious abroad. No test is reported of its
qualities here.

I have not seen it.


=H. glutino´sum= Lind.—_gluten_, glue. (Plate LXXI, fig. 1, p. 268.)
=Pileus= about 3 in. broad, yellow-white, the disk darker, fleshy,
convex then plane, _regular_, obtuse, with a tenacious _viscous_ gluten,
and slimy in wet weather, _sprinkled with white superficial scales_.
=Flesh= whitish, becoming light-yellow. =Stem= 3 in. long, _stuffed_,
firm, _somewhat bulbous, white-scaly_ and fibrillose, and white-mealy at
the top, often rough with bundles of hairs at the base, at length
rust-color within. Partial thread-like veil manifest, in the form of a
cortina. =Gills= sinuato-adnate, somewhat decurrent, crowded, broad,
_pallid then light-yellowish_, at length clay-cinnamon. Odor peculiar,
mild.

On branches and among leaves, oak and beech. Frequent. September to
December. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 5×4µ _W.P._; plum-shaped, 7µ _Q._; elliptical, 10–12×5µ
_Massee_; ellipsoid, 6–7×3–4µ _K._

New York. Among fallen leaves and half-buried decaying wood, in thin
woods. Conklingville. September. In wet weather the gluten is
sufficiently copious to drop from the pileus. _Peck_, Rep. 40.

Haddonfield, N.J., among leaves in mixed woods. Frequent. 1896. Mt.
Gretna, Pa., among leaves under oaks. Frequent. September to November.
_McIlvaine._

=Caps= 1½-3 in. across. Remarkably glutinous, shining as if varnished
when wet. Partial veil not always noticeable.

The odor and taste are pleasant. The caps when well cooked are meaty,
good, but of second quality.


                     DENUDA´TI. Pileus smooth, etc.


=H. crustulinifor´me= Bull.—_crustulum_, a small pie; _forma_, form.
=Pileus= pale-whitish tan, most frequently pale-yellowish or brick-color
at the disk, fleshy, convexo-plane, obtuse or slightly gibbous with an
obtuse umbo, somewhat spreading with an uneven margin, even, smooth, at
first slightly viscid, not zoned. =Flesh= transparent when moist. =Stem=
_stuffed then hollow_, stout, somewhat bulbous, white, naked,
white-scaly at the top. =Gills= _rounded-adnexed_, crowded, _narrowed_,
1 line broad and linear, thin, whitish then clay-color, at length
date-brown, _the unequal edge distilling watery drops in wet weather,
spotted when dry_.

=Veil= quite _wanting_. Odor strong, fetid, of radish. Very variable in
stature; the stem, however, is never elongated as in A. elatus, etc.; in
smaller specimens equal, pileus regular, gills almost adnate.

In mixed woods. Common. August to November. _Stevenson._

Cuticle of the pileus slightly silky, dry or at the first viscid.

None known to be edible.


The genus Flammula is not represented in our territory by a large number
of species. It is, nevertheless, not very sharply distinct from the
allied genera, Pholiota, Hebeloma and Naucoria. From Pholiota it is
especially separated by the slight development of the veil which is
merely fibrillose or entirely wanting. It never forms a persistent
membranous collar on the stem. From Hebeloma it may be distinguished by
the absence of a sinus at or near the inner extremity of the gills, by
the absence of white particles or mealiness from the upper part of the
stem and by the brighter or more distinctly rusty or ochraceous color of
the spores. From Naucoria the fleshy or fibrously fleshy stem affords
the most available distinguishing character. The genus belongs to the
Ochrosporæ or ochraceous-spored series, but the spores of its species
vary in color from ochraceous or tawny-ochraceous to rust-color or
brownish-rust color. The three things to be especially kept in mind in
order to recognize the species are the color of the spores, the adnate
or decurrent but not clearly sinuate gills and the fleshy or fibrously
fleshy stem without a membranous ring.

Our species are mostly of medium size, none being very small and one
only meriting the appellation large. They appear chiefly in late summer
or in autumn and grow in woods or in wooded regions either on the ground
or more often on decaying wood. Many are gregarious or cespitose in
their mode of growth. Some have a bitterish or unpleasant flavor and
none of our species has yet been classed as edible. Fries arranged the
species in five groups, of which the names and more prominent characters
are here given. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

The few species which the writer has found to be edible, and the two new
species found by him, were tested after the publication of the above.
Several of the species found are not mentioned herein for the reason
that a sufficient quantity was not obtained to make certain their
quality as a food. The bitterness, as far as observed, with which most
of the species are tainted disappears in cooking.


                GYMNO´TI. Veil absent, pileus dry, etc.


=F. alie´na= Pk. =Pileus= thin, flexible, broadly convex, umbilicate,
dry, bare, slightly striate on the margin when old, grayish or pale
grayish-brown. =Flesh= white, fibrous. =Gills= thin, subdistant,
bow-shaped, decurrent, ochraceous-brown. =Stem= firm, fibrous-striate,
solid, slightly tapering upward, colored like the pileus, covered at the
base with a dense white tomentum. =Spores= rusty-brown, globose, 5µ
broad.

=Pileus= 3–5 cm. broad. =Stem= 5 cm. long, 4–6 mm. thick.

Gregarious on partly burned anthracite coal, Mt. Gretna, Pa. September.
_C. McIlvaine._

The species is peculiar in its color and habitat. In the dried specimen
the gills have assumed a brown color with no ochraceous tint. Mr.
McIlvaine remarks that it is an edible species, dries well, and is
excellent when cooked. Its relationship is with F. anomala Pk., but it
is a larger plant with darker color and a different habitat. _Peck_,
Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 26, F. 1899.

It grows on partly _burned_ anthracite coal, not _buried_, as printed in
the Torrey Bulletin. The mycelium completely involves the pieces of
coal, holding them tightly in its meshes. Patches of it were strictly
limited to the size of the ash-pile containing the partly burned coal.
Quite fifty were found.

As stated, it is edible, and it is of remarkably fine substance for a
Flammula.


                     LU´BRICI. Pileus viscid, etc.


=F. edu´lis= Pk.—eatable. =Pileus= fleshy, convex, obtuse, glabrous,
moist, brown, grayish-brown or yellowish-brown, sometimes rimose.
=Flesh= whitish. =Lamellæ= rather broad, close, decurrent, bright tan
color, becoming brownish-rusty. =Stems= cespitose, equal, stuffed or
hollow, brown. =Spores= subelliptical, 13×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Grassy ground, along pavements, in gutters and by the side of wooden
frames of hotbeds. Haddonfield, N.J. October. _C. McIlvaine._

The collector of this species informs me that the flavor of the fresh
plant is slightly bitter, but that this disappears in cooking and the
fungus furnishes a very good and tender article of food. Successive
crops continued to appear for a month. In the dried specimens the stem
is striate. _Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.

This new species appears annually in the same place. I have not found it
elsewhere. It is meaty and excellent.

=F. alni´cola= Fr.—_alnus_, alder; _colo_, to inhabit. =Pileus= 2–3 in.
broad, _yellow_, at length becoming rust-color and sometimes green,
fleshy, convex then flattened, obtuse, slimy when moist, but not truly
viscous, at the first superficially fibrillose toward the margin.
=Flesh= not very compact, of the same color as the pileus. =Stem= 2–3
in. and more long, ½ in. thick, _stuffed then hollow_, attenuato-rooted,
commonly curved-flexuous, _fibrillose_, at first yellow, then becoming
rust-color. =Veil= _manifest_, sometimes fibrillose, sometimes woven
into a spider-web veil. =Gills= somewhat adnate, broad, plane, at first
_dingy-pallid_ or yellowish-pallid, at length together with the
plentiful spores rust-colored.

The gills vary decurrent and rounded according to situation. Odor and
taste bitter. There are two forms: _a._ Pileus irregular, fibrillose
round the margin; gills at first dingy-pallid. _b._ Salicicola, pileus
somewhat convex, smooth, rarely at the first downy-scaly; gills at first
yellowish-pallid. _Fries._

at base of alders, with adnate gills, and on birch stumps, with the
gills rounded behind, Rep. 39. Mt. Gretna, Pa., New Jersey, mixed woods,
August to November, 1898, _McIlvaine_.

Gregarious and in loose tufts, not plentiful. It is a pretty plant,
usually of a bright yellow, sometimes darker at the center of cap.
Traces of an evanescent fibrillose ring are occasionally found or the
fibrils adorn the margin of the cap. The gills next to the stem are
either rounded, attached or slightly decurrent.

Raw the taste is slightly bitter. This disappears in long cooking.


=F. fla´vida= Schaeff. (Pers.)—_flavidus_, light yellow. =Pileus=
fleshy, thin, broadly convex or nearly plane, glabrous, moist, pale
yellow. =Flesh= whitish or pale yellow, taste bitter. =Lamellæ=

Decaying wood of various trees. Commonly in wooded or mountainous
districts. Summer and autumn.

Our specimens were found on wood of both coniferous and deciduous trees.
The plants are sometimes cespitose. The pileus becomes more highly
colored in drying. The spores are pale rust-colored approaching
ochraceous. In Sylloge the spores of this species are described as pale
yellowish. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

F. flavida is a frequent species, gregarious and tufted on decaying
wood, either standing, fallen, or as roots in the ground. The texture
and substance are good. The slight bitter when raw disappears in
cooking. The caps, only, are tender.


               SAPIN´EI. Gills and spores yellowish, etc.


=F. hy´brida= Fr.—_hybrida_, a hybrid. =Pileus= about 2 in. broad, at

long, 4–5 lines thick, at first _stuffed_ with a soft pith, then hollow,
_attenuated_ (almost conico-attenuated) _upward_, whitish with adpressed
silky-hairy down (becoming tawny when the down is rubbed off) slightly
striate, with white hairs at the base, and somewhat mealy at the apex.
=Veil= _manifest in the form of an annular zone at the apex of the
stem_, white or at length colored with the spores. =Gills= adnate,
somewhat crowded, _light yellow then tawny, not spotted_. _Fries._

Mt. Gretna, Pa., August, September, 1898. On ground under pine trees.
Gregarious. _W.H. Rorer._ Not elsewhere reported.

This is a handsome plant, quite prolific in the large pine groves at Mt.
Gretna, Pa. The caps are of good flavor.


=F. mag´na= Pk.—_magnus_, large. =Pileus= fleshy, broadly convex, soft,
dry, fibrillose and somewhat streaked, pale yellow or buff, the margin
commonly becoming revolute with age. =Flesh= whitish or yellowish.
=Gills= close, adnate or slightly decurrent, often crisped or wavy
toward the stem, about three lines wide, ochraceous. =Stem= equal or
thickened toward the base, fleshy-fibrous, solid, elastic, fibrillose,
colored like the pileus, brighter yellow within. =Spores= subelliptical,
ochraceous, 10×6µ.

Cespitose. =Pileus= 4–6 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 8–12 lines
thick.

About the base of trees. Westchester county. October.

This is a large and showy species. The stems are sometimes united at the
base into a solid mass. The young gills are probably yellow, but I have
seen only mature specimens. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

New Jersey, Trenton, ground in clearing, in pairs and singly. November,
_E.B. Sterling_; Mt. Gretna, Pa. Mixed thin woods. October to November.
Near trees. Cespitose, _McIlvaine_.

Individuals of all ages were found and eaten. The young gills are very
light yellow, darkening to a deep, rich yellow.

The caps are of good substance and flavor. When very young the stems are
edible.

_somewhat decurrent_. =Spores= rust-color or (in Phæoti) brownish-rust
color.

The species referred to this subgenus were taken from Naucoria and
Galera because they correspond with Omphalia and Eccilia. The pileus is,
however, distinctly umbilicate or depressed in only a few of them; the
others are placed here on account of their somewhat decurrent gills,
which are broadest behind and triangular. _Fries._

Small and unimportant.

=Pileus= more or less fleshy, conical or convex, then expanded, _margin
at first incurved_. =Gills= free or adnate, not decurrent. =Veil=
fugacious or absent, sometimes attached in minute flakes to the edge of
the young pileus. =Stem= cartilaginous, hollow or with a spongy
stuffing. Growing on wood or on the ground, sometimes rooted. =Spores=
various shades of brown, dull or bright.

Naucoria corresponds with Collybia, Leptonia and Psilocybe; from the
latter it is distinguished by the spore colors and from Galera in the
brown-spored series by the margin of the pileus being at first incurved.

“The spores are rust-color, or brownish rust-color. The color of the
pileus is some shade of yellow. The stem is not distinctly ringed, but
sometimes a slight spore-stained band marks the place of the obsolete
ring.” _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

The members of this genus are with two or three exceptions very common,
and common over the land. The greater number grow on the ground among
grass; a few grow upon decaying wood. The stems are not of the same
texture as the cap and frequently will not cook tender. The caps,
however, are, of all species tested, tender and of good flavor. Species
of the genus are among the first to appear in spring, and well reward
the enterprising mycophagist for his early tramps.

gibbous, even, smooth. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3 lines thick, _somewhat
fragile, hollow_, equal, naked, smooth, _pallid_. =Gills=
_attenuato-adnexed_, somewhat free, slightly ventricose, almost 2 lines
broad, crowded, rust-color, opaque. =Veil= none. Widely removed from
neighboring species. Pileus _somewhat separate_ as in Plutei. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, rust-color, 13–14×7µ _Massee_.

Haddonfield, N.J. Frequent. Solitary. On ground along pavements, under
trees, in woods. Spring to autumn. _McIlvaine._

Massee gives it as hygrophanous. I have not found it so. It is moist
after rain and dew.

The caps and upper part of the stem are tender, easily cooked and of
good flavor.


=N. cero´des= Fr. _Gr_—wax. =Pileus= ½-1 in. broad, watery cinnamon when
moist, tan-color _when dry_, somewhat membranaceous, _convex bell-shape_
and flattened, at length depressed, _obtuse_, when moist smooth,
pellucid-striate at the circumference, _when dry_ even, _slightly
silky-atomate_. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1–2 lines thick, slightly firm,
tubed, equal, somewhat flexuous, fibrilloso-striate under a lens,
_becoming dingy bay-brown_ sometimes for the most part, sometimes only
at the base, pallid upward, mealy at the apex. =Gills= adnate,
separating, _very broad behind_, hence almost triangular, _somewhat
distant_, broad, plane, soft, distinct, pallid then cinnamon very finely
fimbriated at the edge under a lens. _Fries._

The typical form, growing among damp mosses, is quite early, gregarious,
with the colors almost those of Galera hypnorum, but otherwise very
different. _b._ Another form occurs on naked, commonly burnt soil, in
late autumn, with almost the habit of N. pediades, but with a different
color of gills and spores; this form is firmer. =Stem= 1 in. long, tense
and straight, and color more ochraceous. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 9µ _B. and Br._; smooth, 6×3µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, in grass and moss, along damp
wood margins. August to October. _McIlvaine._

N. cerodes is not plentiful where I have found it. Enough has been
collected at a time to prove it esculent. It is tender, but has not much
flavor.

[Illustration: NAUCORIA STRIAPES.]

=N. stri´apes= Cke.—_stria_, a line; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= 1–1½ in.
broad, ochraceous, bell-shaped, obtuse, then expanded, smooth, even.
=Stem= 2–3 in. long, 2 lines thick, hollow, equal, erect or flexuous,
white, _longitudinally striate_. =Gills= slightly adnate behind, rather
distant, tawny rust-color.

_Cespitose_ or gregarious. Among grass on lawn. _Stevenson._

=Spores= narrowly elliptical, 10–12×4µ _Massee_.

New Jersey, Trenton. Growing among leaves near dump. May to November.
_E.B. Sterling._

The few specimens tested were delicate and of slight flavor.


                              II.—PHÆ´OTI.


=N. pedi´ades= Fr.—_Gr_, a plain. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad, _yellow_ or
pale yellowish-ochraceous then becoming pale, slightly fleshy, convex
then plane, obtuse, even, dry, smooth, at length crookedly cracked, but
always without striæ. =Flesh= white. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1–2 lines
thick, _stuffed with a pith, somewhat flexuous_, tough, equal, but with
a small bulb at the base, _slightly silky becoming even, yellowish_.
=Gills= adnexed, 2 lines broad, at first crowded, at length somewhat
distant, _somewhat dingy-brown, then dingy cinnamon_.

=Spores= brownish-rust-color. The small bulb at the base is formed by
the mycelium being rolled together. Stature variable. _Fries._

=Spores= dingy rust-color, elliptical, 10–12×4–5µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, in grassy places, pastures and
along pavements. Common. May to November. _McIlvaine._

In 1897 Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, abounded with N. pediades, which
were collected and eaten by many. The caps are tender and of a mushroom
flavor.


=N. semi-orbicula´ris= Bull.—_semi_, half; _orbicularis_, round. (Plate
LXXVIII, p. 294.) =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad, _tawny rust-color_ then
ochraceous, slightly fleshy, convexo-expanded, obtuse, dry, even,
smooth, corrugated when dry. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, scarcely beyond 1 line
thick, cartilaginous, tough, slender, tense and straight, equal, even,
smooth, becoming pallid _rust-color_, shining, often darker at the base,
_internally containing a separate narrow tube_ which is easily broken up
into fibrils. =Gills= adnate, rarely sinuate behind, almost 3 lines
_broad_, and many times broader than the flesh of the pileus, crowded,
_pallid then rust-color_.

The pileus is slightly viscid when fresh and moist. Easily distinguished
from S. semi-globatus, with which it has been confounded, by the stem.
_Stevenson._

=Spores= 14×8µ _W.G.S._; 10×5–6µ _Massee_.

Allied to N. pediades, distinguished by its viscid cap when moist, and
dark stem.

Common over the states. Washington, D.C., _Mrs. Mary Fuller_.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey. Solitary,
sometimes cespitose, very common on lawns, rich pastures, etc. April
until frost. _McIlvaine._

This is one of our first appearing toadstools, coming up when the grass
shows its full spring hue. It is found after rains until the coming of
frost. Its hemispherical caps, precise, neat, dark gills and brown
spores readily distinguish it. While usually small, patience and picking
will soon gather quarts. The caps cook easily and are of excellent
flavor.


=N. platysper´ma= Pk.—_platys_, broad; _sperma_, seed. =Pileus= convex,
becoming nearly plane, glabrous, slightly tinged with ochraceous or
reddish-yellow when young, soon whitish, the margin at first adorned
with vestiges of a white flocculent veil. =Flesh= white. =Lamellæ=
moderately close, slightly rounded behind, pallid, becoming brownish.
=Stem= equal, stuffed with a white pith, slightly flocculent or
furfuraceous above when young, whitish, the mycelium sometimes forming
white thread-like strands. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 15µ long, 12.5µ
broad.

=Pileus= 1–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5.5 in. long, 1.5–2 in. thick.

On the ground. Compton, Cal. _Prof. A.J. McClatchie._

This species differs from N. pediades and N. semi-orbicularis, to which
it is related, by its larger, broader spores and paler color. _Peck_,
Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 25, No. 6.

This new species reported from California is so closely allied to N.
semi-orbicularis and N. pediades, both of which are edible, that it is
here given, that it may be recognized by students on the Pacific coast
or wherever it occurs.

                             =GALE´RA= Fr.

                           _Galerus_, a cap.


=Pileus= more or less membranaceous, conical or oval, then expanded,
striate, margin at the first straight, then adpressed to the stem.
=Gills= not decurrent. =Stem= somewhat cartilaginous, continuous with
the pileus, but differing in texture, tubular. =Veil= none or
fibrillose. =Spores= tawny-ochraceous.

Slender, fragile, generally growing on the ground.

Galera corresponds with Mycena, Nolanea, Psathyra and Psathyrella, which
are distinguished by their spore colors. In the brown-spored series
Naucoria is separated by the margin of the pileus being at first
incurved, and Tubaria by the decurrent gills.

The genus is composed of small species, but many grow in clusters, and
are of a consistency which decreases but little in quick cooking. Those
tested are delicate in texture and flavor.


=G. lateri´tia= Fr.—_later_, a brick. =Pileus= 1 in. high, _pale
yellowish when moist_, ochraceous when dry, hygrophanous, membranaceous,
_acorn-shaped then bell-shaped_, obtuse, even, smooth, slightly and
densely striate at the margin when moist. =Stem= 3 in. and more long, 1
line thick, tubular, attenuated upward, tense and straight, even, but
_white-pruinose, whitish_. =Gills= _adnexed_ in the top of the cone,
hence appearing as if free, ascending, very narrow, _crowded, cinnamon_.

=Gills= almost adpressed to the stem, almost pendulous. Remarkably
analogous with A. ovalis, but easily distinguished by the _linear gills_
and the absence of a veil; very fragile. _Fries._

=Spores= 11×5µ _W.P._; 11–12×5–6µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania. On dung and
rich pastures. June to frost. _McIlvaine._

The narrow conical cap, distinctly striate, distinguishes this species
from G. tenera. In quality there is no difference. It is a
well-flavored, delicate species.


(Plate LXXIX.)

[Illustration:

  GALERA TENERA.

=G. te´nera= Schaeff.—_tener_, tender. =Pileus= ½ in. and more high, _of
one color, pallid rust-color when damp_, becoming pale when dry,
hygrophanous, somewhat membranaceous, _conico-bell-shaped_, commonly
smooth, slightly striate when moist, wholly even when dry, opaque,
somewhat atomate. =Stem= commonly 3–4 in. long, 1 line thick, tubular,
fragile, equal or when larger thickened downward, _tense and straight,
somewhat shining_, striate upward, of the same color as the pileus when
moist, and like it becoming pale when dry. =Gills= _adnate in the top of
the cone_, appearing _as if free_, ascending, somewhat crowded, _linear,
cinnamon_.

Pastures and grassy places in woods. Common. May to November.
_Stevenson._

=Spores= ellipsoid, 14–21×8–12µ _K._; 14–8µ _W.G.S._; 14×7µ _W.P._;
12–13×7µ _Massee_; elliptical, dark rust-color, almost rubiginous,
13–16.5×8–10µ _Peck_.

Var. _pilosella_ (Agaricus pilosellus Pers.), has both pileus and stem
clothed with a minute erect pubescence when moist. A form is sometimes
found in which the center of the pileus is brown or blackish-brown.
_Peck_, 46th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Var. _obscu´rior_ Pk. A notable form of this species was found growing
in an old stable of an abandoned lumber camp. The plants were large, the
pileus in some being more than an inch broad, the stems were 3–6 in.
long and the color was rust-colored as in G. ovalis, to which the plants
might be referred but for the large spores. Essex county. July. I have
labeled the specimens variety _obscurior_. _Peck_, 50th Rep.

Haddonfield, N.J.; Chester county; West Philadelphia, Pa.; West
Virginia. In rich pastures, on lawns, dung in woods. Common. June to
October. _McIlvaine._

Very variable in size and in color when wet and dry. The color of gills
and spores readily distinguishes it in its habitats. From spring to
frost it can usually be gathered in quantity. It is small, tender,
shrivels in cooking, but makes a savory, excellent dish.

Var. obscurior found cespitose on very old manure at a ruined stable,
Mt. Gretna, Pa., August. _McIlvaine._


=G. fla´va= Pk.—_flavus_, yellow. =Pileus= membranous, ovate or bell
shaped, moist or subhygrophanous, obtuse, plicate striate on the margin,
yellow. =Lamellæ= thin, narrow, crowded, adnate, at first whitish, then
yellowish-cinnamon. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward, hollow,
slightly striate at the top, sprinkled with white mealy particles, white
or yellowish. =Spores= ovate or subelliptical, brownish-rust-color,
13×8µ.

=Pileus= 6–12 lines broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1–1.5 lines thick.

Damp vegetable mold in woods. Tompkins county. July.

This species is well marked by the pale-yellow color of the pileus and
its plicate striations which are very distinct even in the dried
specimens. They extend half way to the disk or more. When dry the pileus
is seen to be sprinkled with shining atoms as in some other species of
the same genus. Occasionally the yellow cuticle cracks into squamules or
small scales. _Peck_, 46th Rep.

Trenton, N.J., _Sterling_; Haddonfield, N.J.; Pennsylvania. Among chips
in woods and on woods ground. _McIlvaine._

This species is frequent, and when plentiful well worth gathering. It
has a more woody flavor than other Galera, but is tasty.


=G. vittæfor´mis= Fr.—_vitta_, a chaplet; _forma_, form. =Pileus= ½-1
in. broad, _date-brown_ when moist, membranaceous, conical then
hemispherical, obtuse, _even at the disk_, striate toward the margin,
smooth. =Stem= 1½-3 in. long, ½-1 line thick, tubular, equal, _somewhat
straight_, but not tense and straight, smooth or sometimes pubescent,
slightly striate under a lens, _opaque, rust-color_. =Veil= scarcely
conspicuous. =Gills= adnate, broader at the middle, in the form of a
segment when larger, somewhat ascending, somewhat distant, at first
_watery-cinnamon_, at length rust-color. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, 12×6µ _Massee_.

Haddonfield, N.J.; Mt. Gretna, Pa. On pastures, lawns, etc. June to
September. _McIlvaine._

Not previously reported.

Though small it makes up in quantity when found. The stems are not as
tender as the caps. Quality good.

                            _Gr_—cow’s dung.


=Pileus= membranaceous. =Gills= adnexed or free, membranaceous, soft,
salmon-color or rusty, dissolving (not dripping as in Coprinus),
powdered with the rusty spores. =Stem= central; universal veil absent,
partial veil often obsolete.

Very delicate and fragile, remarkable among the Ochrosporæ for the gills
dissolving into mucus, and in this respect analogous with Coprinus among
the Melanosporæ, and Hiatula amongst the Leucosporæ. Growing on dung or
amongst grass where dung abounds.

A small but very natural genus, with the vegetative portion like
Coprinus and the fructification resembling Cortinarius, hence occupying
an intermediate position between these two genera. _Fries._


=B. Bol´toni= Fr.—after Bolton. =Pileus= rather fleshy, viscid, at first
even, then with the membranaceous margin sulcate, disk darker,
subdepressed. =Stem= attenuated, yellowish, at first floccose from the
remains of the fugacious veil. =Gills= subadnate, yellow then
livid-brown. _Fries._

Haddonfield, N.J., cespitose among manure on sawdust.

Of small substance but good consistency and flavor.

somewhat umbonate, smooth, viscous, _striate round the margin_ (which is
often crenulated). =Stem= 3 in. long, 1 line or little more thick,
fistulose, attenuated upward, _naked, smooth_ (and without a manifest
veil), yellow. =Gills= attenuato-adnexed, almost free, ventricose,

Thinner than B. Boltoni, etc., very fragile, rapidly withering.

On dung. Common. June to October. _Stevenson._

=Spores= subspheroid-ellipsoid, elliptical, 7×3–5µ _Massee_.

West Virginia; Pennsylvania. June to frost. On rich grass and dung.

Pileus usually not over 1.5 in. across. Often in plenty. Its substance
does not cook away as with C. micaceus. It amply repays gathering, being
highly flavored.

red, the margin at length recurved and splitting. =Gills= subdistant,
tapering outwardly, attached, the alternate ones more narrow,
pale-yellow with a darker edge. =Stem= long, equal, smooth, striate at
the top, hollow, white.

=Plant= cespitose, 3–5 in. high. =Pileus= 1 in. broad. =Stem= 1 line

[Illustration:

  CREPIDOTUS MOLLIS.
  Natural size.
]

=Veil= wanting or not manifest. =Pileus= eccentric, lateral or
resupinate. =Spores= rust-color.

The Crepidoti correspond in shape and habit to the smaller Pleuroti and
the Claudopodes, but they are distinguished from both by the rust-color
of their spores. These are globose in several species, in others they
are elliptical. In some there is a depression on one side which gives
them a naviculoid character and causes the spore to appear slightly
curved when viewed in a certain position. In consequence of the
similarity of several of our species, the character of the spores is of
much importance in their identification, and it is unfortunate that
European mycologists have so generally neglected to give the spore
characters in their descriptions of these fungi. In most of the species
the pileus is at first resupinate, but it generally becomes reflexed as
it enlarges. It is generally sessile or attached by a mass of white
fibrils or tomentum. For this reason it is usually somewhat tomentose or
villose about the point of attachment, even in species that are
otherwise glabrous. In several species the pileus is moist or
hygrophanous and then the thin margin is commonly striatulate. This
character is attributed to but one of the dozen or more European
species. Their mode of growth is usually gregarious or somewhat loosely
imbricated, in consequence of which the pileus, which in most species is
white or yellowish, is often stained by the spores, and then it has a
rusty, stained or squalid appearance. The species occur especially on
old stumps, prostrate trunks and soft much decayed wood in damp, shaded
places. _Peck_, 39th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=C. ful´vo-tomento´sus= Pk.—tawny-tomentose. =Pileus= ¾-2 in. broad,
scattered or gregarious, suborbicular, kidney-shaped or dimidiate,
sessile or attached by a short, white-villose tubercle or rudimentary
stem, hygrophanous, watery-brown and sometimes striatulate on the margin
when moist, whitish, yellowish or pale ochraceous when dry, _adorned
with small, tawny, hairy or tomentose scales_. =Lamellæ= broad,
subventricose, moderately close, rounded behind, radiating from a
lateral or eccentric white villose spot, whitish becoming
brownish-ferruginous. =Spores= _elliptical_ often uninucleate,
8–10×5–6µ.

Decaying wood of poplar, maple, etc. Common. June to October.

A pretty species, corresponding in some respects to the European C.
calolepis, but much larger and with tawny, instead of reddish scales.
The cuticle is separable and is tenacious, though it has a hyaline
gelatinous appearance. The pileus is subpersistent, and specimens dried
in their place of growth are not rare. _Peck_, 39th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Haddonfield, N.J.; Angora, West Philadelphia. On decaying hickory.

                           =CORTINA´RIUS= Fr.

                     _Cortina_, a veil or curtain.


=Veil= resembling the consistency of a cob-web, superficial, distinct
from the cuticle of the pileus. =Flesh= of pileus and stem continuous.
=Gills= persistent, dry, changing color, powdered with the spores.
=Trama= fibrillose. =Spores= globose or oblong, somewhat ochraceous on
white paper. _Fries._

This genus is not easily confounded with any other, the cob-webby veil
stretched from stem to pileus in the young plant not being found in
other fungi. This must be looked for only in youth, as from its tender
character it soon breaks and often appears only as a very indistinct
collar on the stem, colored from catching the falling spores. The colors
are generally pronounced and often extremely bright, there being very
few prettier toadstools than those inclined to the blue or purple
shades, which are not uncommon in the immature form. The color of the
spores is also a marked feature, being rusty or brownish-ochraceous,
turning the gills to the same color at maturity. On account of this
change it is generally necessary to have specimens at both stages of
growth to accurately determine the species. The gills are thin, attached
to the stem in various manners, rarely slightly decurrent.

Cortinarius is distinguished from Flammula by growing on the ground and
by the bright ferruginous color of its spores.

Cortinarius is a sturdy, hardy genus preferring northern latitudes and
autumnal months, though several of its species grow as far south as
Alabama, and one, a new species described by Professor Peck, is found on
the Helderberg mountains in May. The genus contains many species, most
of which produce in great numbers, yet being woods-growing, and coming
as they do when leaves are falling, they are often missed because of
their similarity to their surroundings.

Heretofore, less than a dozen species have been reported as eaten. This
number is now doubled. While several species are bitter and others
equally unpleasant, not one has been accused of harm. It is highly
probable that other varieties than those herein given will prove equally
acceptable as food. I have tested all I have found in sufficient
quantity to warrant passing judgment upon them.

The genus does not contain as many species of superior excellence as
other fleshy genera of like numbers. The flesh is frequently dry and of
a strong woody or musky flavor, which it does not lose in cooking. The
stems are seldom cookable. All can be fried in butter, but cut in small
pieces and well stewed, or stewed and served in patties, or made into
croquettes are certain ways of keeping them in palate memory.

brittle, internally stuffed or hollow. Veil single, thread-like.

                          TELAMONIA. Page 323.

Pileus moist, hygrophanous, at first smooth or sprinkled with the
whitish superficial evanescent fibrils of the veil. Flesh thin, or when
thick it becomes abruptly thin toward the margin, scissile. Stem ringed
below or coated from the universal veil, slightly veiled at the apex,
hence with almost a double veil.

                          HYGROCYBE. Page 325.

Pileus hygrophanous, smooth or covered with superficial white fibrils,
not viscid, moist when fresh, becoming discolored when dry. Flesh very
thin or scissile, rarely more compact at the center. Stem rather rigid,
bare. Veil thin, rarely collapsing and forming an irregular ring on the
stem.

                  * _Gills pallid, then clay-colored._


=C. seba´ceus= Fr.—_sebum_, tallow. =Pileus= 2½-5 in. broad,
unicolorous, _pale_, of the color of tallow, equally fleshy, convex then
rather plane, commonly very repand, viscid, smooth, but at the first
_covered over with a whitish pruinose luster_. =Flesh= white. =Stem= 3–4
in. long, ½-1 in. thick, solid, stout, compact, never bulbous, often
twisted and compressed, slightly fibrillose, pale white. =Cortina=
delicate, fugacious, adhering only to the margin of the pileus. =Gills=
emarginate, _not crowded_, connected by veins, 4 lines broad, clay-color
or pallid-cinnamon, paler at the sides. _Fries._

The flesh of the pileus is not compact at the disk and abruptly thin at
the circumference, but equally attenuated toward the margin. The flesh
of the stem is white. The gills never turn bluish-gray. Taste mild.
_Stevenson._

=Spores= pip-shaped, 9×7µ _Cooke_.

A very common and prolific species in West Virginia, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, North Carolina. _McIlvaine._

Pushing from the earth in great clusters it raises the mat of leaves
above it into hut-like mounds through which it seldom bursts. Yet side
openings to its huts show its coziness, and reveal the ground thickly
dusted with its spores. Detecting these mounds is part of the woodcraft
of a toad-stool hunter.

Where clusters are not dense, or the fungus is solitary, the stem is
frequently swollen at the base, even bulbous.

Both caps and stems are edible, but the stems are not equal to the caps.
It is a valuable food species, because of its lateness and quantity. It
is not of best quality.


=C. tur´malis= Fr.—_turma_, a troop. (Plate LXXXII, fig. 4, p. 306.)
=Pileus= yellow-tan, most frequently darker at the disk, not changeable,
compact, convex then plane, very obtuse, even, smooth (sometimes

fugacious villous down, soon naked, viscid. =Flesh= white. =Stem=
sometimes 3 in., sometimes 6 in. long, 1 in. thick, solid, very hard,
rigid, _cylindrical_, here and there attenuated at the base, shining
white when dry, _when young sheathed with a white woolly veil_, naked
when full grown. Cortina entirely fibrillose, superior and persistent in
the form of a ring, at length ferruginous with the spores. =Gills=

Under pine needles forming mounds. _Taylor._

The localities and the habit of C. turmalis are very like that of C.

Mushroom beds, manured soil in conservatories or in plant pots. Boston,
Mass. _R.K. Macadam._ Haddonfield, N.J. _C. McIlvaine._

This interesting species is closely allied to Cortinarius multiformis
and belongs to the Section Phlegmacium. It has a slight odor of radishes
and is pronounced edible by Mr. McIlvaine. Its habitat is peculiar, but
it possibly finds its way into conservatories and mushroom beds through
the introduction of manure or soil, or leaf mold from the woods. It
seems strange, however, that it has not yet been detected growing in the
woods or fields. Hebeloma fastibile is said sometimes to invade mushroom
beds, and our plant resembles it in so many particulars that it is with
some hesitation I separate it. The chief differences are in the stem and
spores. The former, in Hebeloma fastibile, is described as solid and
fibrous-squamose and the latter as 10×6 micromillimeters in size. The
brighter color of the smaller spores and the stuffed or hollow smooth
stem of our plant will separate it from this species. _Peck_, Bull. of
the Torrey Bot. Club, October, 1896.

Cortinarius intrusus was a happy find. Several pints of it were
collected by the author in February—usually a famine month for the
mycophagist. They grew on the ground, in beds among plants, and with
potted plants in a hot-house in Haddonfield, N.J. The crop continued
well into the spring. The species is delicate, savory, and a most
accommodating renegade from its kind. I have never found it elsewhere.

                    ** _Gills blue, then cinnamon._

=C. cærules´cens= Fr. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across, equally fleshy, convex
then plane, obtuse, regular, even, almost glabrous, but often
fibrilloso-streaked; viscid, when dry shining or opaque, dingy yellow,
almost tan-colored, varying to yellowish-brown, etc. =Gills= slightly
rounded behind, adnexed, thin, closely crowded, 2 lines broad, at first
clear intense blue then becoming purplish, at length dingy cinnamon.
=Stem= about 2 in. long, ½ in. thick (bulb more than an inch), firm,
equally attenuated upward, at first fibrillose, bright violet, then
becoming pale and whitish, naked, bulb often disappearing with age; veil
fibrillose, fugacious. =Spores= elliptical, 9–10×5µ.

Amongst moss in woods, etc.

Neither the gills nor the flesh change color when broken, a point which
distinguishes the present from C. purpurascens. When young every part is
generally blue. Smell scarcely any. _Fries._

=Spores= 10–12×5µ _Cooke_.

Haddonfield; West Virginia; Mt. Gretna, Pa. In woods September to frost.
_McIlvaine._

The American species seldom entirely loses the bluish-purple color of
its cap. The beautiful color fades somewhat or becomes splotched with
yellow. Neither does the bulb ordinarily disappear with age. It is
common. Taste of cap is mild, somewhat woody. They require long, slow
stewing, and are better made into patties and croquettes.


=C. purpuras´cens= Fr.—gills becoming purple when bruised. =Pileus= 4–5
in. across, fleshy, disk compact, obtuse, wavy, variable, covered with a
dense layer of gluten, but opaque when dry, bay or reddish then
tawny-olivaceous, spotted; often depressed round the margin, which is at
first incurved then wavy, marked with a raised brown line. =Flesh=
entirely clear blue. =Gills= broadly emarginate, 3 lines and more broad,
crowded, bluish-tan, then cinnamon, violet-purple when bruised. =Stem=
about 3 in. long, ⅔ in. and more thick, solid, bulbous, everywhere
fibrillose, intensely pallid clear blue, very compact, juicy, becoming
purplish-blue when touched, bulb submarginate. =Spores= elliptical,
10–12×5–6µ _Fries_.

Var. _subpurpuras´cens_. Massachusetts. _Frost._

Plentiful in West Virginia mountains in mixed woods, 1882. On South
Valley Hill, near Downington, Pa., October, 1887. Haddonfield, N.J.,
1892. In woods. September to frost. _McIlvaine._

Both stems and caps are juicy when young and of agreeable flavor. It is
among the best edible species of Cortinarius.

             *** _Gills brownish-white, then ferruginous._


=C. turbina´tus= Fr.—_turbo_, a top. =Pileus= _unicolorous_,
dingy-yellow or green, _becoming pale_, hygrophanous, opaque when dry,
fleshy, convex then flattened, obtuse, at length depressed, orbicular,
even, _smooth_, viscid. =Flesh= soft, _white_. =Stem= commonly curt, 2
in., but varying elongated, yellowish, springing from a
globoso-depressed distinctly marginate bulb, otherwise equal,
cylindrical, _stuffed then hollow_. =Gills= attenuato-adnate, thin,
crowded, broad, _quite entire_, at first pallid light-yellowish, at
length somewhat ferruginous.

The typical form is _regular_, distinct from its allies in the
_hygrophanous pileus, in the gills being isabelline-ferruginous and
quite entire, and in being without any dark-purple or purple color_.
Easily distinguished by its turbinate bulb. _Fries._

[Illustration:

  CORTINARIUS COLLINITUS.
  About natural size.
]

=C. collin´itus= Fr.—_collino_, to besmear. =Pileus= convex, obtuse,
glabrous, glutinous when moist, shining when dry. =Gills= rather broad,
dingy-white or grayish when young. =Stem= cylindrical, solid, viscid or
glutinous when moist, transversely cracking when dry, whitish or paler
than the pileus. =Spores= subelliptical, 13–15µ.

The Smeared cortinarius is much more common than the Violet cortinarius
and has a much wider range. Both the cap and stem are covered with a
viscid substance or gluten which makes it unpleasant to handle. The cap
varies in color from yellow to golden or tawny-yellow and when the
gluten on it has dried it is very smooth and shining. The flesh is white
or whitish. The young gills have a peculiar bluish-white or dingy-white
color which might be called grayish or clay color, but when mature they
assume the color of the spores. They are sometimes minutely uneven on
the edge.

The stem is straight, solid, cylindrical and usually paler than the cap.
When the gluten on it dries it cracks transversely, giving to the stem a
peculiar scaly appearance.

The cap is 1½-3 in. broad, and the stem 2–4 in. long, and ¼-½ in. thick.

The plant grows in thin woods, copses and partly cleared lands and may
be found from August to September.

It is well to peel the caps before cooking, since the gluten causes dirt
and rubbish to adhere tenaciously to them. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

In 41st Rep. N.Y. State Mus. Nat. Hist., p. 71, Professor Peck describes
a closely allied species, C. muscigenus, n. sp., “separated by its more
highly-colored pileus, striate margin and even, not diffracted-squamose
stem.”

Prof. L.B. Mendel gives the following analysis: “Young specimens
gathered in New Haven early in November, 1897, gave:

                 Water                          91.13%

                 Total solids                    8.87

                 Total nitrogen of dry           3.63”
                 substance

Edible. _Cooke._

In appearance the Smeared cortinarius does not appeal to be eaten.
Neither does an eel. But peeled both are inviting. Raw, the caps of this
fungus have a strong woody smell and taste. This is somewhat subdued by
cooking.

I have found the plant in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and North
Carolina, often among the leaves in mixed woods, but it prefers a goodly
supply of light and the freedom of open places. It is often gregarious,
sometimes tufted.


=C. io´des= B. and C. =Pileus= 1½-2 in., convex, at length plane,
viscid, firm, violet-purple. =Flesh= white, thick. =Veil= fugacious,
spider-web. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1½ in. thick, solid, thickened below.
=Gills= violet, at length cinnamon, ventricose, adnate, sub-emarginate,
irregular, sometimes forked. _B. and C._

This is a small but beautiful species, the pileus, lamellæ and stem
being of a bright-violet or purplish-violet hue. The spores are
subelliptical, generally uninucleate, 10×6µ. _Peck_, 32d Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

The pileus in this species is sometimes spotted with white. The bulbous
white stem is adorned with lilac-colored fibrils. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y.

Sparingly found among roots at Mt. Gretna, Pa., September, 1897–1898.

The caps are fairly good.

                  * _Gills violaceous then cinnamon._


=C. viola´ceus= Fr. (Plate LXXXII, fig. 2, page 306.) One of our most
plentiful and beautiful autumnal fungi. As the American plant differs
somewhat from the European, Professor Peck’s description is given.

=Pileus= convex, becoming nearly plane, dry, adorned with numerous
persistent hairy tufts or scales, dark violet. =Lamellæ= rather thick,
distant, rounded or deeply notched at the inner extremity, colored like
the pileus in the young plant, brownish-cinnamon in the mature plant.
=Stem= solid, fibrillose, bulbous, colored like the pileus. =Spores=
subelliptical, 12.5µ long.

The Violet cortinarius is a very beautiful mushroom and one easy of
recognition. At first the whole plant is uniformly colored, but with age
the gills assume a dingy ochraceous or brownish-cinnamon hue. The cap is
generally well formed and regular and is beautifully adorned with little
hairy scales or tufts. These are rarely shown in figures of the European
plant, but they are quite noticeable in the American plant and should
not be overlooked. The flesh is more or less tinged with violet.

The gills when young are colored like the cap. They are rather broad,
notched at the inner extremity and narrowed toward the margin of the
cap. When mature they become dusted with the spores whose color they
take.

The stem also is colored like the cap. It is swollen into a bulb at the
base and sometimes a faint ochraceous band may be seen near the top.
This is due to the falling spores which lodge on the webby filaments of
the veil remaining attached to the stem.

=Cap= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, about ½ in. thick. _Peck_,
48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Minerva, Essex county. A form of this species occurs here, having the
pileus merely downy or punctate-hairy under a lens, no squamules being
distinguishable by the naked eye. July. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

=Spores= 12–14×10µ _Cooke_.

The spider web veil is exquisitely displayed in this species. This, with
its strongly bulbous base and violet tinge throughout, easily mark it.
Though usually solitary great numbers of it are found in its
settlements. The mixed woods of central New Jersey abound with it in
July, August and September. Throughout Pennsylvania and West Virginia it
is common, and is reported from several other states. In Redman’s woods,
near Haddonfield, N.J., a densely clustered form of singular beauty
occurs. A dozen individuals of various forms and sizes with swollen
stems form a compact mass, rich in color, and cutting crisp and juicy as
an apple. They are far better than other Cortinarii I have eaten. I have
not seen it elsewhere.

C. violaceus is everywhere eaten, and is in my opinion the best of its
genus. The American plant is not inodorous, but has a decided mushroom
smell and taste.

and color very variable; pileus from ½-3–4 in. across; color of pileus
changeable, depending on the more or less persistence of the down
(fundamental color and veil constant in this species and its allies);
gills varying through blood-red, reddish cinnamon, tawny saffron, golden
and yellow. _Fries._

=Pileus= thin, convex, obtuse or umbonate, dry, fibrillose at least when
young. =Flesh= yellowish. =Lamellæ= thin, close, adnate. =Stem= slender,
equal, stuffed or hollow. =Spores= elliptical, 8µ long. _Peck_, 48th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 7–8×4µ _Cooke_.

The Germans are said to be very fond of this species, which is generally
stewed in butter and served with sauce for vegetables.

Catalogued by Dr. M.A. Curtis, North Carolina, as edible. Edible.
_Cooke._

Var. _semi-sanguin´eus_ received from E.B. Sterling, Trenton, N.J.,
August, 1897. Juicy and good.

The species is common over the United States and plentiful in its
numerous varieties from August to frost. It frequents mixed woods,
borders and open and mossy places. The pine woods of New Jersey yield it
in quantity, as do the hemlock forests of Eagle’s Mere, Pa., and oak
woods of West Virginia.

It has a smell and taste—mildly of radishes. Its flavor when cooked is
decided but pleasant.

(Plate LXXXVIII.)

[Illustration: CORTINARIUS ARMILLATUS.]

=C. armilla´tus= Fr.—_armilla_, a ring. (Plate LXXXII, fig. 5, p. 306.)
=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad, _red-brick color_, truly fleshy, but not very
compact, at first cylindrical, soon campanulate, at length flattened,
dry, at first smooth, soon innately fibrillose or squamulose, flesh
dingy pallid. =Stem= 3–6 in. long, ½ in. thick, solid, firm, remarkably
bulbous (bulb 1 in. thick, villous, whitish) and fibrillose at the base,
when old striate and reddish-pallid, internally dirty yellow. Exterior
veil woven, red, arranged _in 2–4 distant cinnabar zones encircling the
stem_; partial veil continuous with the upper zone, arachnoid,
reddish-white. =Gills= adnate, slightly rounded, distant, at first
pallid cinnamon, at length very broad (½ in.), dark ferruginous, almost
bay-brown.

Odor of radish. A very striking species. From the pileus not being
hygrophanous, _at the first smooth_ and at length torn into fibrils or
squamulose, it might easily be taken for a species of Inoloma. The
cortina itself is paler than the zones. It differs from all others in
these zones. The rings are usually somewhat oblique. _Fries._

Professor Peck in the 23d Rep. N.Y. State Cab. Nat. Hist., describes the
American species as follows:

“=Pileus= fleshy, thick, convex or subcampanulate, then expanded,
minutely squamulose, yellowish-red. =Lamellæ= not close, broad, slightly
emarginate, whitish-ochraceous, then cinnamon. =Stipe= stout, solid,
fibrillose, whitish, girt with one to four red bands, bulbous.

“Height 4–6 in., breadth of pileus 2–4 in., stipe 4–8 in. thick.

“Woods. North Elba. August.

“A large and noble species. The margin of the pileus is thin and
sometimes uneven; the upper band on the stem is usually the brightest
and most regular. The pileus is not distinctly hygrophanous.”

=Spores= 10×6µ _Cooke_.

Edible. _Cooke._

September 8, 1897, Mr. E.B. Sterling, Trenton, N.J., sent me several
specimens new to me and remarkable in having two well-defined veils, the
lower and thicker one of which left a dark zone upon the stem, the
upper, fibrillose, was more persistent, but left a fainter impression.
These veils are not mentioned in Professor Peck’s description of the
American species, but are prominently noted in that of Fries, as above.
In a very young specimen both veils were present. Cap light brown,
minutely squamulose, with a few small red spots; margin thin, involute,
flesh thick, yellowish, firm; gills distant, rounded behind, slightly
emarginate, alternate ones short, light brown inclined to cinereous on
edge.

Spores brown. Small young specimens did not show bulbous stem as
distinct as larger and older ones.

I afterward found several specimens at Mt. Gretna, Pa., September and
October, 1897.

The flesh is excellent, closely resembling Pholiota subsquarrosa. The
species seems to be rare. If found in quantity it will prove one of our
very best edibles.


=C. dis´tans= Pk. =Pileus= thin except the disk, convex, squamulose,
bay-brown when moist, tawny when dry. =Lamellæ= broad, distant, thick,
dark cinnamon-color. =Stipe= subequal, often a little tapering upward,
solid, slightly fibrillose-scaly, concolorous.

Height 2–3 in., breadth of pileus 1–2 in., stipe 4–6 in. thick.

Grassy ground in pine woods. Greenbush. June.

The flesh is dull-yellowish. The pileus, when drying, has for a time a
brown-marginal zone. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

New Jersey pines. Eagle’s Mere, Pa., coniferous woods. August. Mt.
Gretna, Pa., pines. August, September. _McIlvaine._

Like most of the hygrophanous Cortinarii, the taste is more or less that
of rotten wood. The flavor is flat and undesirable.


=C. furfurel´lus= Pk. =Pileus= thin, convex, furfuraceous with minute
squamules, hygrophanous, watery-tawny when moist, pale ochraceous when
dry. =Lamellæ= broad, thick, distant, adnate or slightly emarginate,
tawny-yellow, then cinnamon. =Stem= equal, peronate, colored like the
pileus, with a slight annulus near the top. =Spores= subelliptical,
minutely rough, 8–10×6µ.

=Plant= 1–2 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 lines thick.

Moist ground in open places. Gansevoort. August. _Peck_, 32d Rep. N.Y.

Haddonfield, N.J., Mt. Gretna, Pa. _McIlvaine._

Strong woody flavor—like rotten wood. Not poisonous, but not desirable.


                               HYGROCYBE.


=C. casta´neus= Bull.—chestnut. =Pileus= fleshy, thin, campanulate or
convex, then expanded, dark chestnut-color when moist, paler when dry.
=Lamellæ= rather broad, violet-tinged, then cinnamon. =Stipe=
fibrillose, stuffed or hollow, lilac tinged at the top, white below.

Height 2–3 in., breadth of pileus 1–2 in., stipe 3–4 lines thick.

Ground under spruce or balsam trees. Catskill mountains. October.
Edible. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 8×5µ.

It is certainly a wholesome, esculent species, but a great number would
be required to make a good dish. _M.C. Cooke._

Catalogued by Rev. M.A. Curtis, North Carolina, as edible.

Eaten in Italy. Inodorous, edible and agreeable. _Cordier._ More than
fair. I have often eaten it. _R.K. Macadam._

                            =PAXIL´LUS= Fr.

                       _Paxillus_, a small stake.


=Hymenophore= continuous with the stem, decurrent. =Gills=
membranaceous, somewhat branched, frequently anastomosing behind,
_distinct from the hymenophore and easily separable from it_. =Spores=
dingy-white or ferruginous.

_Fleshy putrescent fungi, margin of pileus at first involute, then
continually and gradually unfolding and expanding._ _Fries._

=Pileus= symmetrical or eccentric. =Stem= central, eccentric or wanting.
Edge of gills entire, sharp.

The marked features of this genus are the strongly involute margin, the
soft, tough, decurrent gills, separating readily from the flesh, and the
color of the spores.

The members of this genus possess some of the characters of Boletus. The
gills separate easily from the hymenophore as do the tubes of the
latter, and their anastomosing tendency is in P. porosus so marked that
the hymenium consists of large angular tubes. The gills of P. solidus B.
and C. form pores at the base, and its spores are elongated, both
features indicating an affinity with Boletus.

Pileus generally eccentric or resupinate. Spores rust-color. On the
ground or on stumps.

So far as known the species of this genus are harmless. Many of them are
large, fleshy and inviting in appearance, but their flesh is usually dry
and coarse, and, though absorbent, is hard to cook tender. P.
atrotomentosus, which seems to be rare, is an exception. The flesh of
this species being firm in texture and readily made into a first-class
dish.


                               LEPIS´TA.


=P. lepis´ta= Fr.—_lepista_, a pan. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad, flat or
depressed, dirty-white, smooth, sometimes minutely cracked near the
margin which is thin, involute and often undulate. =Stem= very variable
in length, 1–4 in., ½-¾ in. thick, dingy white or cream, solid, white
inside, equal, with a cartilaginous cuticle passing between the gills
and the flesh of the pileus, base blunt, villous, white. =Gills= very
decurrent, crowded, 2–3 lines broad, slightly branched but not at the
base, dingy-white becoming darker.

=Spores= reddish, becoming dingy brown. Broadly pyriforme 6×8µ _Massee_.

Pennsylvania. September, 1894. _McIlvaine._ Albion, N.Y., _Dr. Cushing_,
1898.

On ground in woods and margins of woods.

=Flesh= white. =Gills= narrow, crowded, brittle, decurrent, dingy-white
or pale-buff, easily separating from cap. =Stem= solid, elastic, at
length hollow, often short, an inch long, tapering downward, frequently
up to four inches in length and equal, base villose.

Resembling Lactarius piperatus and some forms of Clitocybe. It is
separated from the former by the absence of milk and from the latter by
its involute margin. The Clitocybe resembling it are all edible.

=Smell= strong, like old oily nuts. Edible but coarse.


=P. li´vidus= Cke. =Pileus= 1–2 in. across, convex, at length slightly
depressed at the disk, margin slightly arched and incurved, dingy-white,
or livid ochraceous, opaque. =Gills= decurrent, arcuate, almost crowded,
1½ line broad, white. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, ½ in. thick at the apex,
attenuated downward, white, fibrillose, stuffed then hollow, usually
rather flexuous. =Flesh= nearly white. =Spores= globose, 3–3.5µ
diameter, nearly white.

In woods. Usually in small clusters. Closely allied to Paxillus
revolutus, but distinguished by the absence of any tinge of violet on
the pileus or stem, and by the persistently white gills. _Massee._

Received from Katherine A. Hall, Danville, N.Y. October, 1898.

Raw it tastes like a drug-store smell. Edible, pleasant.

[Illustration:

  PAXILLUS INVOLUTUS.
  One-half natural size.
]

=P. involu´tus= (Batsch) Fr.—_involutus_, rolled inward. =Pileus= 2–5
in. broad, fleshy, compact, convexo-plane then depressed, smooth, viscid
when moist, shining when dry, yellowish or tawny-ochraceous, _strongly
involute_, _margin densely downy_, flesh pallid. =Stem= 2–4 in. high,
about ½ in. thick, solid, firm, paler than the pileus, central or
eccentric. =Gills= 2–3 lines broad, crowded, branched, anastomosing,
_forming pores behind_, whitish then yellowish or rusty, _spotting when
bruised_.

=Spores= rust-color, ellipsoid or oblong-ellipsoid 8–16×6µ _K._; 5×6µ
_W.G.S._ Elliptical, 8–10µ _Peck_.

It grows singly or in groups and likes damp mossy soil. Common in cool
hemlock or spruce woods in the Adirondack mountains; not rare in the
mixed woods of all our hilly districts. When growing on decayed stumps
the stem is sometimes eccentric. August, November. _C.H. Peck._

In open woods near Haddonfield, N.J., it grows to a large size and in
quantity. In Angora woods near Philadelphia a complete ring of it 20 ft.
in diameter was seen.

Considered edible throughout Europe and said to be highly esteemed in
Russia. The flesh of the American plant is dry and coarse, does not cook
tender and is rather tasteless.


=P. a´tro-tomento´sus= (Batsch.) Fr.—_ater_, black; _tomentum_, down.
=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad, rust-color or reddish-brown, compactly fleshy,
eccentric, convex then plane or depressed, margin thin, frequently
minutely rivulose, sometimes tomentose in the center. =Flesh= white.
=Stem= 3–6 in. high, ½-1 in. thick, stout, solid, elastic, eccentric or
lateral, unequal rooting, _covered with dense velvety down, very dark
brown_. =Gills= adnate, 3 lines broad, close, anastomosing at the base,
yellowish, interspaces venose.

=Spores= subhyaline 4–6×3–4µ _K._ Elliptical, pale-yellowish, 5×2.5–3µ
_Massee_. Elliptical 5–6×4µ _Peck_.

Found near Philadelphia, gregarious in old woods. September. In New
Jersey in pine woods on stumps and on the ground, probably growing from
roots. _McIlvaine._

Grows singly or cespitose, sometimes in large tufts, when the pileus is
frequently irregular from compression. In wet weather the pileus is
moist and sometimes obscurely mottled with dark spots. Occasionally it
has an unpleasant dirt-like odor. _Peck._

Cordier considers this species suspicious and Paulet inutile on account
of its bad taste.

The flesh differs from most Paxilli in being very fine grained and
cooked is of the consistency of a marshmallow. The taste is marked but
pleasant.




         _Series IV._ =PORPHYRO´SPORÆ= (Pratelli). _Gr_—purple.


Spores typically black-purple or brownish-purple, more rarely dusky
brown. (It is to be observed that the spores vary in color according to
the color of the ground on which they are deposited.) There are sterile
forms with the gills persistently white (A. obturatus, A. udus). Those
species are more deceptive in which the gills continue for a long time
white, and even begin to decay before they are discolored by the spores;
these may be easily mistaken for Leucospori. _Fries._

Pratelli is the name given by the early authors to this series, based
upon the spore color; Porphyrosporæ is the name now used. The species
within the group are closely allied to those having black spores without
a tinge of purple or violet (Melanosporæ), but in none of the species do
the gills deliquesce as in Coprinus, neither are there resupinate or
lateral stemmed species.

There is a present tendency to do away with this series and include all
dark-spored species in the Melanosporæ. Professor Atkinson and Bertha
Stoneman, in their “Provisional Key to the Genera of Hymenomycetes,”
omit the series and give “Melanosporæ, Gill and Butz (Pratellæ and
Coprinariæ in broadest sense). Spores dark brown, purplish-brown or
black.”

It is frequently difficult to determine by the spore-color of this

belong in this series. I know of none noxious.




                            =CHITON´IA= Fr.


Universal veil distinct from the pileus, at maturity forming a distinct
volva round the base of the ringless central stem. =Gills= free from the

 _Agaricon_, a Greek name for fungi, said to be derived from the name of
                              a town, Agara.


=Pileus= fleshy, flesh of the stem different from that of the pileus,
furnished with a distinct ring. =Gills= at first enclosed by the veil,
free, rounded behind, at first white or whitish, in some species this
stage lasting but a short time, then pink or reddish, at length dark
purplish-brown from the spores. =Spores= brown, brownish or
reddish-purple.

On the ground, generally in pastures, meadows or manured ground, a few
species occur in woods.

Analogous with Lepiota of the white-spored series. Stropharia also bears
a ring and has similar colored spores, but is separated by the flesh of
stem and pileus being continuous and the gills being more or less
adnate.

Formerly in Agaricus as sub-genus Psalliota (_psallion_, _psalion_, in
poetry, a ring). When Psalliota was raised to generic rank it was given
the name of the great genus Agaricus as a mark of distinction on account
of its including the most widely known and useful mushroom of the
world—Agaricus campester. The name Psalliota is not in modern use.

Old Agaricus included many subgenera and consequently many more species.
Now it contains but few. All of them are highly flavored and of marked
excellence. Before the subgenera under Agaricus were promoted to full
generic standing it was customary to state the name of a species thus:
Agaricus (Psalliota) campester. Agaricus (Stropharia) semi-orbicularis.
This was lengthy and clumsy. In the older books this form prevails.
Often, however, the subgenus is omitted before the name, which compels
the student to look up the subgenus to which the species belongs. The
older books are therefore puzzling to modern students, who find there
simply the name Agaricus to guide them. The present genus of a known
species in old Agaricus can be easily found by looking in the index for
its specific name. The name of the genus follows it in parentheses.

All of the genus can be cooked in any desired way.

The varieties of A. campester are numerous. All of them are edible and
vary but slightly in their excellence.

Var. _al´bus_ Berk.—_albus_, white. A very common wild form. =Cap= 2–4
in. across, smooth or slightly fibrillose. =Stem= 1½-3 in. long, ⅓-⅔ in.
thick, white or whitish. Spring to autumn, in rich grassy places.
Sometimes very large. It is cultivated.

Var. _gri´seus_ Pk.—_griseus_, gray. =Cap= grayish, silky, shining.
=Ring= vanishing. Reported from Virginia.

Var. _prati´cola_ Vitt.—_pratum_, a meadow; _colo_, to inhabit. Meadow
variety. =Cap= covered with reddish scales. =Flesh= pinkish. Parade
ground, Mt. Gretna, Pa.

Var. _umbri´nus_ Vitt.—_umber_, dark brown. =Cap= brown, smooth. =Stem=
short, minutely scaly.

“Var. _rufes´cens_ Berk.—_rufescens_, becoming red. =Pileus= reddish,
minutely scaly. =Gills= at first white. =Stem= elongated. =Flesh=
turning bright red when cut or bruised. This departs so decidedly from
the ordinary characters of the type, especially in the white color of
the young gills, that it seems to merit separation as a distinct
species.” _Peck_, 36th Rep.

Var. _villa´ticus_ Brond.—belonging to a villa. =Cap= scaly. =Stem=
scaly.

Var. _horten´sis_ Cke.—growing in gardens. =Cap= brownish or
yellowish-brown, covered with fibrils or minute hairs. This is a
cultivated species.

“Var. _Bu´channi_. =Cap= white, smooth, depressed in center, the margin
naked. =Stem= stout. =Ring= thin, lacerated. A rare variety, sometimes
occurring in mushroom beds.

“Var. _elonga´tus_—elongated. Long-stemmed variety. =Pileus= small,
smooth, convex, the margin adorned with the adherent remains of the
lacerated veil. =Stem= long, slender, slightly thickened toward the
base. =Ring= slight or evanescent. This is also a variety of mushroom
beds.

“Var. _vapora´rius_. Green-house variety (A. vaporarius Vitt.) =Pileus=
brownish, coated with long hairs or fibrils. =Stem= hairy-fibrillose,
becoming transversely scaly. Conservatories, cellars, etc. Not differing
greatly from Var. hortensis.” _Peck_, 36th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

The A. campester is known the world over as the common mushroom. It is
cosmopolitan, appearing in pastures and rich places from spring and
until long after severe frosts. It is the sweet morsel of gourmets.
Indirectly it has done more damage than the assembled viciousness of all
other toadstools. It is by mistaking the young button forms of the
deadly Amanita for the button forms of the common mushroom that most
cases of fatal toadstool poisoning are brought about. It is, also,
usually the persons who think they know the mushroom, and can not be
deceived, that get poisoned. If two rules are observed danger can be
avoided. (1) Never eat a fungus gathered in the woods believing it to be
the mushroom. The typical A. campester does not grow in the woods;
species of Agaricus somewhat resembling it do. (2) Look at the gills;
those of the mushroom are at first a light-pink which rapidly, as the
plant matures, darken to a dark-brown, purplish-brown, or
purplish-black. This is due to the ripening of the spores. Those of the
Amanita are constantly white.

Pages could be written upon the mushroom and its culture, and recipes
for the cooking of it would fill a volume. One important thing is
omitted from them all—it is culinary heresy to peel a mushroom. Much of
the flavor lies in the skin, as it does in that of apples, apricots,
peaches, grapes, cherries and other fruits. The mushroom should be wiped
with a coarse flannel or towel until the skin is clean. See chapter on
cooking, etc.

Lafayette B. Mendel, in American Journal of Physiology, March, 1898,
gives the following analysis of A. campester:

Two varieties of the common mushroom were collected in New Haven.
Fifteen specimens of one variety weighed 1½ ounce, an average weight of
43 grains each. The analysis gave:

                                           _a._     _b._

=A. comp´tulus= Fr.—_comptus_, gaily adorned. =Pileus= 1–1½ in. broad,
_yellowish-white_, slightly fleshy, convex then plane, obtuse,
_adpressedly fibrilloso-silky_, becoming even. =Flesh= thin, soft, of
the same color as the pileus. =Stem= 2 in. long, 2–3 lines thick,
_hollow_, stuffed with floccules when young, _somewhat attenuated_,
even, smooth, white, becoming somewhat light yellow. =Ring= medial,
torn, _fugacious_, of the same color. =Gills= rounded-free behind,
crowded, soft, broader in front, _flesh-color_ then _rose_, not
dingy-flesh-color except when old.

Closely allied to A. campestris, but constantly distinct in its more
beautifully colored gills. _Fries._

Cultivated ground. Menands. August. _Peck_, Rep. 41.

Closely allied to A. campestris, from which it may be separated by its
smaller size, the yellowish hue of the dry plant and by the smaller
spores. _Peck_, 41st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

August to frost. _McIlvaine._

A. comptulus appears frequently in the latitude of Philadelphia. It is a
neat species, but not substantial in flesh. Here it usually grows close
to the ground. The ring is very evanescent.

Its edible qualities are those of A. campester.


=A. silvat´icus= Schaeff.—belonging to woods. =Pileus= thin, at first
convex or bell-shaped, then expanded, _gibbous or subumbonate_,
fibrillose or variegated with a few thin tawny brownish or reddish-brown
_spot-like adpressed scales_, whitish, brownish or smoky-gray, the disk
sometimes tinged with red or reddish-brown, the flesh white or faintly

In taste and smell A. silvaticus resembles A. silvicola, but is
stronger. It is a frequent but not common species in the localities
where I have found it. Quantities of it have not occurred, but myself
and friends have eaten it for years, knowing no distinction in effect
between it and allied species. Its strong taste requires that it be well
cooked. It does not lose its high flavor, which may be objectionable to
some. I prefer using its juices as a flavoring.


=A. diminuti´vus= Pk.—diminutive. =Pileus= thin, fragile, at first
convex, then plane or centrally depressed, sometimes slightly umbonate,
whitish or yellowish, faintly spotted with small thin silky appressed
brownish scales, the disk brownish or reddish-brown. =Lamellæ= close,
thin, free, ventricose, brownish-pink becoming brown, blackish-brown or
black. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward, stuffed or hollow,
smooth, pallid. =Annulus= thin, persistent, white. =Spores= elliptical
5×4µ.

=Plant= 1.5–2 in. high. =Pileus= 1–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 lines

Woods. Croghan and Sandlake, N.Y. August. Autumn.

This is a small but symmetrical and beautiful Agaric. It is perhaps too
closely related to the preceding species (A. silvaticus), of which it
may possibly prove to be a mere variety or dwarf form. Its pileus is
quite thin and fragile. Usually the darker or reddish hue of the disk
gradually loses itself in the paler color of the margin, but sometimes
the whole surface is tinged with red. _Peck_, 36th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Chester county; West Philadelphia, Pa., September; Mt. Gretna, Eagle’s
Mere, Pa., August. _McIlvaine._

I have found A. diminutivus so intimately associated with A. silvaticus
that its being a dwarf form of the latter seemed more than probable. Its
edible qualities are the same.


=A. Rod´mani= Pk. =Pileus= rather thick, firm, at first convex, then
nearly or quite plane, with decurved margin, smooth or rarely slightly
cracked into scales on the disk, white or whitish, becoming yellowish or
subochraceous on the disk, the flesh white, unchangeable. =Lamellæ=
close, _narrow_, rounded behind, free, reaching nearly or quite to the
stem, _at first whitish then pink or reddish-pink_, finally
blackish-brown. =Stem= short, subequal, solid, whitish, smooth below the
ring, often scurfy or slightly mealy-squamulose above; ring variable,
thick or thin, entire or lacerated, at or below the middle of the stem.
=Spores= broadly elliptical or subglobose, generally uninucleate,
5–6×4–5µ.

=Plant= 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 6–10 lines thick.
Grassy ground and paved gutters. Astoria, L.I. _Rev. W. Rodman_.
Washington Park, Albany. May to July.

This species is intermediate between A. campestris and A. arvensis, from
both of which it may be distinguished by its narrow gills, solid stem
and smaller, almost globose, spores. In size, shape of the pileus and
general appearance it most resembles A. campestris, but in the whitish
primary color of the gills and in the yellowish tints which the pileus
often assumes, it approaches nearer to A. arvensis. * * * _Peck_, 36th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

I can now add my own testimony to that of Mr. Rodman as to its
edibility. Its flesh is firm but crisp, not tough, and its flavor,
though not equal to that of the common mushroom, is nevertheless
agreeable, and its use as food is perfectly safe. _Peck_, Rep. 49.

This species has grown freely for several years at Hull and Cohasset,
Mass. It is usually found about June 1st, and is not seen again until
early autumn. It is the handsomest mushroom I have seen, and its edible
qualities are on a par with its appearance. _Macadam._


=A. hæmorrhoida´rius= Shulzer. _Gr_—discharging blood. =Pileus= 4 in.
across, reddish-brown, fleshy, ovate then expanded, _covered with broad
adpressed scales_, margin at first bent inward. =Flesh= when broken
immediately blood-red. =Stem= 4 in. high, 1 in. thick, soon hollow,
fibrillose, the solid base somewhat bulbous. =Ring= superior, large.
=Gills= free, approximate, crowded, rosy-flesh-color, at length
purple-umber.

Very striking, 3–4 in. high. The pileus and the white stem become
spotted blood-red when touched. The stem when young is adpressedly
squamulose below, when full grown mealy, becoming smooth. _Fries._

=Spores= purple-brown, 7–8×5µ Massee; brown, elliptical, 5–6×4µ _Peck_.

A rare or overlooked plant in United States, first recorded by Professor
Peck, who found it but once, growing under a hemlock tree. Rep. 45.

Nebraska, _Clements_; West Virginia; Eagle’s Mere and Mt. Gretna, Pa. In
hemlock and mixed woods. Autumn. _McIlvaine._

=Cap= 2–4 in. across. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, up to ¾ in. thick.

Every part of the plant turns red and has a congested appearance when
bruised. The flesh is white but immediately becomes red when broken.

It is a frequent but not common species, growing singly, or in small
clusters.

In flavor and substance it is equal to any mushroom.


=A. mari´timus= Pk. =Pileus= very fleshy, firm, at first subglobose,
then broadly convex or nearly plane, glabrous, sometimes slightly
squamose with appressed spot-like scales, white becoming dingy or
grayish-brown when old. =Flesh= whitish, quickly reddening when cut,
taste agreeable, odor distinct, suggestive of the odors of the seashore.
=Lamellæ= narrow, close, free, pinkish becoming purplish-brown with age,
the edge white. =Stem= short, stout, firm, solid, equal, sometimes
bulbous, white, the annulus delicate, slight and easily obliterated.
=Spores= broadly elliptic, purplish-brown, 7–8µ long, 5–6µ broad.

=Pileus= 2–8 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, .6 in. thick.

Sandy soil near salt water, Lynn, Mahant and Marblehead, Mass. June to
December. _R.F. Dearborn._

This is a very interesting and an excellent mushroom. Dr. Dearborn
writes that he has used it on the table for fourteen years and that it
is the only mushroom that he has ever eaten in which the stem is as good
as the cap. He considers it the most hearty and satisfying of all the
numerous species that he has ever eaten. Both its taste and odor is
suggestive of the sea. The latter is quite strong, and perceptible by
one riding along the road by whose side the mushrooms are growing. They
sometimes grow in semicircles and attain a larger size in warm weather
than in the colder weather of autumn. They are most abundant in August.
The flesh, when cut or broken, quickly assumes a pink or reddish hue on
the freshly-exposed surface. This is a very distinctive character and
with the maritime habitat makes the species easy to recognize. Another
species, Agaricus hæmorrhoidarius Kalchb. exhibits a similar change of
color in its wounded flesh, but is of very rare occurrence with us, does
not, so far as ascertained, grow near the sea, has a darker cap and a
long hollow stem. The stem in the maritime mushroom is short and solid.
Its collar is very slight and easily destroyed. _Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot.
Club, Vol. 26, No. 2, F. 1899.


=A. Califor´nicus= Pk.—=Pileus= at first subconical, becoming convex,
minutely silky or fibrillose, whitish, tinged with purple or
brownish-purple on the disk. =Flesh= whitish. =Gills= close, free, pink
becoming purplish, then blackish-brown. =Stem= rather long, solid or
stuffed, equal or tapering upward, distinctly and rather abruptly
narrowed above the entire externally silky ring, pallid or brownish.
=Spores= broadly elliptical, 5–6×4–5µ.

=A. Elven´sis= B. and Br.—Name from river Elwy, Wales, where first
found. Tufted. =Pileus= 4–6 in. or more across, subglobose then
hemispherical, fibrillose, broken up into large persistent brown scales,
areolate in the center, margin very obtuse, thick, covered with
pyramidal warts. =Stem= at first nearly equal, at length swollen in the
center, and attenuated at the base, 4–6 in. high, 2 in. thick in the
center, fibrillose and areolate below, nearly smooth within the pileus,
solid, stuffed with delicate threads. =Ring= thick, very large,
deflexed, broken here and there, warted in areas beneath. =Gills= rather

This is a small mushroom, peculiar in having the young gills of a dark
color and in the absence of any pink hues. The gills sometimes become
moist and manifest a tendency to deliquesce. The drying specimens emit a
strong but not unpleasant odor. Mr. Brændle says that their edible
quality is excellent and that it is not impaired by drying. _Peck_,

This species is so closely related to the common mushroom that it is
regarded by some authors as a mere variety of it. Even the renowned
Persoon is said to have written concerning it: “It appears to be only a
variety of A. campestris.” Fries also says that it is commonly not
distinguished from A. campestris, but that it is diverse in some
respects; its white flesh being unchangeable, its gills never
deliquescing, remaining a long time pale and not becoming dark-red in
middle age. Berkeley says of it: “A coarse but wholesome species, often
turning yellow when bruised.” _Peck_, 36th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

Unless the numerical system of John Ph[oe]nix to express degrees of
quality is adopted by a mycophagists' congress, and one species of
fungus is chosen as the standard of excellence, the comparative
excellence of species will never be settled. English epicures shun A.
arvensis; the French prefer it. Berkeley says it is inferior to the
common mushroom; Vittadini says it is very sapid and very nutritious. So
opinion varies. Individual tastes must decide excellence. Comparison
never will. Toadstools differ in substance, texture and taste as one
meat or vegetable differs from another. Beef could not be chosen as the
standard for meats, or cabbage as the standard for vegetables. Agaricus
arvensis is good.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, June to frost. _McIlvaine._

A. silvicola, by many authors considered a variety of A. campester, is,
seemingly, becoming common. Professor Peck in 46th Rep. has made the
abrupt bulb and its usual double veil distinctive marks which ally it to
A. arvensis. He therefore calls it var. abruptus. As this book goes to
press Professor Peck writes me that he concludes var. abruptus to be a
good and distinct species. It is therefore given as such. While familiar
with it since 1881, I never found it in quantity until 1898, at Mt.
Gretna, Pa. There, among the straw and rubbish of abandoned camps on
wood margins, it grew in great quantity; sometimes singly, at others in
crowded clusters. When growing singly it exhibits all the
characteristics of its description; when clustered, the stems are not
always bulbous. The caps are thin but fleshy, brittle and bear a
disproportionate width to the stem—like a plate on a pipe stem. The caps
when mature are usually tinged with yellow and are spread flat; the ring
is large, often double, yellowish, often torn, fragments of it
frequently hang from the cap margin; the bulb when perfect is small,
abrupt, as if it had once been round but the stem pushed into it. It has
a strong spicy mushroom odor and taste, and makes a high-flavored dish.
It is delicious with meats. It is the very best mushroom for catsup.
Mixed with Russulæ or Lactarii or other species lacking in mushroom
flavor, it enriches the entire dish. The stems, excepting of the very
young, are tough.

Larvæ do not infest A. silvicola. Its habit of growth shows it to be
cultivatable. It has but one draw-back. Growing as it does in woods and
in the presence of the poisonous Amanita, it is possible for the
careless collector to confound the two. The Amanitæ have larger bulbs,
cups at the base, and _white gills_; the A. silvicola has no volva, has
whitish gills when very young only, they become pinkish, then a marked
blackish-brown.


=A. creta´ceus= Fr.—_creta_, chalk. =Pileus= 3 in. and more broad,
wholly _white_, fleshy, lens-shaped-globose when young, then
convexo-flattened, obtuse, dry, _sometimes even_, sometimes rivulose
chiefly round the margin from the cuticle _separating into squamules_.
=Flesh= thick, white, unchangeable. =Stem= 3 in. long, 3–6 lines and
more thick, _hollow, stuffed with a spider-web pith_, firm, attenuated
upward, even, smooth, not spotted, white. =Gills= free, then remote,
ventricose but _very much narrowed toward the stem_, crowded, _remaining
long white_, becoming dingy-brown only when old. _Fries._

Indiana, _H.I. Miller_, 1898; Haddonfield, N.J., _McIlvaine_.

June 2, 1896, I found several specimens of a fungus new to me, and sent
them to Professor Peck for identification. He pronounced it a dwarf form
of his species A. subrufescens. The cluster grew on a florist’s compost
pile at Haddonfield, N.J. Its flesh has a flavor like that of almonds.

This species is now cultivated and has manifest advantages over the
marketed species—it is easier to cultivate, very productive, produces in
less time after planting the spawn, is free from attacks of insects,
carries better and keeps longer.

Amateurs are likely to succeed in growing it, and to have goodly crops
of mushrooms instead of disappointments.


=A. placo´myces= Pk. _Gr_—a flat cake. (Plate XCI, fig. 3, p. 332.)
=Pileus= thin, at first convex, becoming flat with age, whitish, brown
in the center and elsewhere adorned with minute brown scales. =Lamellæ=
close, white, then pinkish, finally blackish-brown. =Stem= smooth,
annulate, stuffed or hollow, bulbous, white or whitish, the bulb often
stained with yellow. =Spores= elliptical, 5–6.5µ long.

=Cap= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, ¼ to nearly ½ in. thick.

It grows in the borders of hemlock woods or under hemlock trees from
July to September. It has been eaten by Mr. C.L. Shear, who pronounces
it very good. I have not found it in sufficient quantity to give it a
trial. This mushroom is very closely related to the wood mushroom or
silvan mushroom, Agaricus silvaticus, a species which is also recorded
as edible, but which is apparently more rare in our state (New York)
than even the flat-cap mushroom. This differs from the silvan mushroom
in its paler color, in having the cap more minutely, persistently and
regularly scaly, and in its being destitute of a prominent center. In
the silvan mushroom the scales, when present, are few, and they
disappear with age. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mrs. E.C. Anthony, Gouverneur, N.Y., June, 1898, writes: “In great
abundance on lawn, tumbling over one another in their haste to make
their appearance. One of the largest, which did not have half a chance
to display its proportions, would probably measure 7 in., perhaps more.
When mature they crack across the top, showing the white flesh. The
gills are pink, stem white, solid and bulbous. There is no perceptible
odor when fresh.”

Indiana, _H.I. Miller_, edible, good.

Specimens sent to me by Mrs. Anthony, though not fresh, were eaten by
me. They very much resembled the common mushroom, but probably, owing to
their condition, were not so tender.

I have not found the species. The illustration is after a painting by
Mrs. E.C. Anthony.


=A. varia´bilis= Pk.—variable. (Plate XCI, fig. 1, p. 332.) =Cap= 2–6
in. across, ovate, bell-shaped, irregularly convex and wavy, margin
incurved but never striate, smooth, minutely fibrillose, with few
remaining floccose scales; mature plant pure white, when young
distinctly tinged with lilac and here and there with yellow when mature,
slightly, broadly umbonate and depressed around umbo, cracks along
gills. =Flesh= thick in center, very thin, even membranaceous toward
margin, spongy, unchangeable. =Gills= free, close, thin, flaccid,
ventricose, narrow next stem, but few short, pure-white when young, then
dark-umber without purple tinge. =Stem= equal, tubed, white, silky,
smooth above ring, rippled and minutely furfuraceous (scurfy) below,
flocculose-furfuraceous when young, densely hairy at base, and
occasionally slightly expanding, but not bulbous, densely cespitose with
a coarse, white, root-like mycelium. =Veil= heavy at first, mottled with
yellow scales beneath; as cap expands veil becomes thin, like tissue
paper, ruptures at both stem and margin leaving torn ring on stem and
appendiculate fragments on edge of cap.

=Spores= shed in great quantity, rich dark umber-brown without shade of
purple.

=Taste= strong like almond. =Smell= slightly of musk, like the running
mycelium of A. campester.

Found at Mt. Gretna, Pa. _Charles McIlvaine._

I have never found worms in this species. It is very prolific and its
habitat shows that it can be cultivated. Its freedom from worms and
lasting carrying quality will make it commercially valuable.

It grew in an old roofless stable from September until after several
frosts, in enormous quantity, 25 or 30 pounds in a patch. It differs
from A. subrufescens in not having a shade of red about it, in its very
distinct light-lilac cap when full grown, and in its snow-white youth.
The young gills are pure white as are the caps. The stems sometimes
taper upward, but they are usually remarkably equal.

It is delicate when cooked and of excellent flavor.


=A. tabula´ris= Pk.—relating to boards. =Pileus= 5–10 cm. broad, very
thick, fleshy, firm, convex, deeply cracked in areas, whitish, flesh
whitish, tinged with yellow, the areas pyramidal, truncate, the sides
horizontally striate, their apices sometimes tomentose. =Lamellæ=
narrow, close, free, blackish-brown when mature. =Stem= short, thick,
solid. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 7.5–9µ long, 6–7.5µ broad, generally
containing a single large nucleus.

In clay soil by roadsides. Craig, Colorado. August. _E. Bethel._

This species is remarkable for the peculiar upper surface of the pileus
which is broken into pyramidal areas. The sides of these are marked by
parallel lines in such a way that they appear as if formed by small
tablets placed one upon another, each successive tablet being a little
smaller than the one immediately preceding it. Only dried and broken
specimens have been seen by me and the notes of the collector do not
give the color of the young lamellæ. There is a trace of a thick ring on
the broken stem of one specimen. _Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 25,
No. 6, 1898.

Not elsewhere reported. Edible qualities not given.

Hymenium differentiated from the stem. =Gills= free from the stem;
general and partial veil both absent, hence there is no ring on the
central stem. =Spores= purple-brown.

A peculiar genus, with the habit of Agaricus, but without a trace of a
ring. _Massee._

=Flesh= of stem and pileus _continuous_. =Veil= present, when ruptured

On the ground or epiphytal.

Separated from all the genera of the purple-spored series but Agaricus
by the presence of a distinct ring, and from that by the continuity of
flesh in stem and pileus, and by the gills not being free. =Pileus=
somewhat fleshy, sometimes viscid.

The species belonging to this genus are rather small, and from their
habitats are frequently passed or overlooked. Yet many of them are
common and plentiful. Those which have been tested are excellent and
worth seeking in their season. The entire genus has been under a cloud.
Writers upon it assert some of its members to be dangerously poisonous.
So far as carefully tested by the writer no doubtful one has been
encountered, and one—semiglobata—has been eaten by himself and friends
since 1881, notwithstanding its dangerous reputation.

The division between this genus and Agaricus is not always sharply
defined. S. æruginosa, S. semiglobata and S. stercoraria were formerly
placed in Psalliota, now Agaricus.

  STROPHARIA ÆRUGINOSA.
  Natural size. (After Stevenson.)
]

=S. ærugino´sa= Curt.—_ærugo_, verdigris. =Pileus= fleshy, but not
compact, convex-bell-shaped then flattened, somewhat umbonate (obtuse
when larger), _with very viscid pellicle_, the ground color yellowish
but _verdigris from the azure-blue slime_ with which it is more or less
covered over, becoming pale as the slime separates. =Stem= _hollow_,
soft, equal, _at the first scaly_ or fibrillose _below the ring, viscid,
becoming_ more or less _azure-blue green_. =Ring= distant. =Gills=
adnate, plane, 2 lines and more broad, not crowded, soft, whitish then
dusky, becoming somewhat purple.

The above are the essential marks of this species. Variable in form,
sometimes cespitose. The typical and handsomest form is gathered in
soaking weather in later autumn in shaded woods; it is large (pileus and
stem 3 in. and more), stem squarrose with white spreading scales,
intensely verdigris or azure-blue-pelliculose and very glutinous. From
this there is a long series of forms with the gluten more separating (on
the separation of the gluten the pileus becomes yellow), and the scales
alike of the pileus and stem rubbed off. Finally, a smaller form occurs
in open meadows, stem scarcely 2 in. long, only 2 lines thick, becoming
azure-blue-green and without scales, pileus 1–2 in. broad, pale
verdigris soon light yellowish, less viscid. In this form the ring is
incomplete, while in the typical form it is entire, spreading, and
persistent.

In woods, meadows, etc. Common. July to November. _Stevenson._

=Spores= ellipsoid or spheroid-ellipsoid, 8×4–5µ _K._; 5×7µ _W.G.S._;
elliptical, 10×5µ _Massee_.

POISONOUS. _Stevenson._

“There is a white variety, in which the pileus is perfectly white from
the first.” _Cooke._

S. æruginosa has been noted here by Schweinitz in Pennsylvania, Curtis
in North and South Carolina, Frost in Vermont and Massachusetts,
Harkness and Moore, California, Morgan, Ohio. The qualities of the
American representatives are not reported. I have not seen the species.
As it is asserted to be poisonous by European writers it may be. M.C.
Cooke says: “It has the reputation, which is somewhat general on the
continent, of being poisonous, but probably this is only assumed from
its disagreeable taste and repulsive appearance.” Collectors are
cautioned to look out for it, and not to eat of it carelessly.

I can find no case of poisoning by this species reported. It presents
another case of “Not proven.”

                 ** Merda´rii—_ring often incomplete._


=S. stereora´ria= Fr.—_stercus_, dung. =Pileus= 1 in. broad, yellow,
fleshy, but thin at the margin, hemispherical then expanded, obtuse,
orbicular, with a viscid pellicle, naked, smooth, even or at length
slightly striate only at the margin. =Stem= 3 in. and more long, 2–3
lines thick, stuffed with a separate fibrous pith, equal, clothed to the
ring (which is scarcely 1 in. distant from the pileus, viscous, narrow,
but somewhat spreading) with the flocculose veil which is at the same
time viscous (so that it appears as if smooth), yellow. =Gills= adnate,
very broad behind, 2 lines broad, somewhat crowded, dusky-umber or
dusky-olivaceous, of one color, quite entire.

Stem silky-viscous when moist, when dry becoming even, shining and
yellowish-white, and without a manifest veil. The gills are truncate and
somewhat decurrent. _Fries._

=Spores= 17×13µ _W.G.S._; elliptical, 18–20×8–10µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, 1881–1885; Pennsylvania; New Jersey. June to November.
_McIlvaine._

I have enjoyed this species, which is common, since 1881. It is usually
conspicuous upon droppings and manure piles. It also occurs on
richly-manured ground, in wood and field, usually single; sometimes two
or three are united.

Caps and stems are edible, but do not cook in the same time. It is
better to cook the caps only. They are delicious.

line thick, tubed, slender, firm and straight, equal, even, smooth,
becoming yellow, paler at the apex, powdered with the spores, otherwise
smeared with the glutinous veil which is abrupt above terminating in an
_incomplete_ (not membranaceous) viscous, distant _ring_. =Gills=
adnate, _very broad_, plane, _clouded with black_.

=Spores= dusky-purple. _Stevenson._

=Spores= blackish-purple, 13×8µ _W.G.S._; elliptical, ends rather acute,
12×6µ _Massee_.

Grows on dung, rich lawns and pastures. April to November. A common,
frequent, solitary species, easily recognized by its hemispherical cap,
dark mottled gills. At first sight it resembles Naucoria
semiorbicularis.

The caps are equal to any mushroom. I have eaten it since 1881. M.C.
Cooke says: “It was Sowerby who drew attention to this species as
dangerous, and intimated that it had been fatal. Since that period we
are not aware of any further evidence against it.”

It is tender, good and harmless.

Members of this purple-spored genus grow upon decayed wood, either
standing or as roots in the ground, or from ground heavily laden with
woody material. They grow singly, in groups, or in densely-tufted or
overlapping masses. The several species vary in shades of yellow, red,
orange, brick-color and brown; their caps are from 1–6 in. across; their
stems are short or long, as the number in the cluster permits; when
growing singly the stems are short and sturdy. There is a floccose veil,
or remnants of one, about the stem. The gills are yellowish, greenish,
olivaceous or greenish shades of yellow, gray, purple, almost black.
They are showy, easily recognized and are found from September until
mid-winter. I have gathered them when frozen hard. The flesh is solid,
or spongy, flexible or fragile, white or yellowish; the tastes are
sweet, nutty, bitter and saponaceous. Patches of them—and they are
frequent in almost every woods in the land—often yield several bushels.
Tons of them annually go to waste.

Old authors and some copyists say “the species are not edible, the tough
ones being bitter, the fragile ones almost void of flesh.” Eighteen
years of experience with them warrants my saying that there is not a
single wild genus approaching it in economic value, and when its most
prominent species are properly cooked, few equal it in consistency and
flavor. As a pickle the Hypholomas have no superior.

Half a dozen or more of the species are exceedingly difficult to
separate. Professor Peck has happily made a new species, H. perplexum,
which is well named. For all culinary purposes these affiliated species
may be gathered under that convenient name; for botanic purposes his
description covers several perplexing characteristics common to what
have been written as separate species, and covers a composite species.

The occasional bitter taste of some species is not constant, and can not
be relied upon as a distinguishing mark. In the same tufts some
individuals may be mild, others bitter; some individuals in groups are
in a position and of an age to absorb water; others are not. There will
be a marked difference in their taste raw. A few in the same group may
have been infested by insects; others not. Those infested are often
intensely bitter, while their companions are of pleasant flavor. The
same remarks apply to neighboring clusters and individuals. I am of the
opinion, from long observation, that the bitter is largely due to the
injury and excrement of larvæ. Changes of taste occur in toadstools in a
most marked and rapid manner. Apples from the same tree, chestnuts from
the same tree, acorns from the same oak, radishes from the same seed,
blackberries from the same bush, differ widely in taste. Why not
toadstools of the same species?

I have often seen species of this genus, described as having stems up to
5 in. long, stretch and twist their stems to over a foot in order to get
their caps from the inside of, or from a crack in a decaying stump, out
into the light; and I have seen stems of the same species stout, solid
and sturdy when individuals grew upright and singly. But wherever and
however they grow, Hypholomas are safe. I have eaten them
indiscriminately since 1881, and as long ago as 1885 published their
edibility.


                   FASCICULA´RES. Pileus smooth, etc.


=H. perplex´um= Pk.—_perplexus_, perplexed. Perplexing Hypholoma. (Plate
XCVII, fig. 2, p. 352.) =Pileus= convex or nearly plane, glabrous,
sometimes broadly and slightly umbonate, reddish or brownish-red fading
to yellow on the margin, the flesh white or whitish. =Lamellæ= thin,
close, slightly rounded at the inner extremity, at first pale-yellow,
then tinged with green, finally purplish-brown. =Stem= nearly equal,
firm, hollow, slightly fibrillose, whitish or yellowish above,
rusty-reddish or reddish-brown below. =Spores= elliptical,
purplish-brown, 8×4µ.

The Perplexing hypholoma has received the name because it is one of a
group of five or six very closely allied species, whose separation from
each other is somewhat difficult and perplexing. Of these six species
three have a decidedly bitter, unpleasant flavor, and three are mild, or
not decidedly bitter, if we may rely on the published descriptions of
them. The three bitter ones, also, have no purplish tints to the mature
gills; but two of the mild ones have. By using these and other
distinguishing characters the six species may be tabulated and their
several peculiarities more clearly shown.

      2. Cap brick-red, stem ferruginous, gills green,           elæodes
      becoming       olive

 3.   Cap red or brick-red, with a yellow margin; gills        perplexum
      yellow,       then greenish, finally

      4. Gills gray, becoming purplish-brown                   capnoides

      4. Gills yellow, becoming gray, neither green nor       epixanthum
             purplish

Probably in general appearance the Perplexing hypholoma most nearly
resembles the brick-red Hypholoma, H. sublateritium; but it has often
been mistaken for the tufted Hypholoma, H. fasciculare. From this it may
be separated by the more red cap, the whitish flesh, the purplish-brown
color of the mature gills, and the mild flavor. From H. sublateritium it
is distinguished by its usually smaller size, more slender hollow stem,
the yellow greenish and purplish tints of the gills, and the absence of
a bitter flavor. Some may prefer to consider it a variety of this
fungus, rather than a distinct species.

Its cap is 1–3 in. broad, its stem 2–3 in. long and 2–4 lines thick. It
commonly grows in clusters, though sometimes singly, on or about old
stumps or prostrate trunks of trees, in woods or open places. The caps
of the lower ones in a cluster are often defiled and apparently
discolored by the spores that have lodged on them from the upper ones.
It appears in autumn, and continues until freezing weather stops its
growth. It is a very common species, as well as a late one, and may
often be gathered in large quantity. Its flavor is not first quality,
but with good preparation it makes a very acceptable dish. It has been
tested by myself and correspondents several times, and has been proved
harmless. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, 1881–1885; New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
October to January. On stumps, roots, ground containing decayed woody
matter. _McIlvaine._

H. perplexum is abundant in most if not all the states. I have eaten it
and its allied species since 1881; dried them, pickled them, and fed
them to many. If the collector gets puzzled, as he will, over one or all
of these species, because no description fits, he can whet his patience
and appetite by calling it H. perplexum and graciously eating it.


=H. capnoi´des= Fr. _Gr_—like smoke, from the color of the gills.
=Pileus= 1 in. sometimes 3 in. broad, _ochraceous-yellowish_, fleshy,
convex, then flattened, obtuse, dry, _smooth_. =Flesh= somewhat thin,
white. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 2–4 lines thick, growing together at the
base, _hollow_, equal, often curved and flexuous, _becoming silky-even_,
pallid, whitish at the apex, here and there striate, becoming
rust-colored under the surface-covering when old. Cortina appendiculate,
white, then becoming brownish-purple. =Gills= adnate, easily separating,
somewhat crowded, rather broad, arid, _at first bluish-gray then
becoming brownish-purple_.

Cespitose, fasciculate; odor and taste mild. On pine-stumps. Uncommon.

=Spores= ellipsoid-spheroid, 7×5µ _K._; elliptical, brownish-purple,
8×4µ _Massee_.

California, _H. and M._; Minnesota, not necessarily in fir-woods,
_Johnson_; New York, on or about stumps or decaying wood of spruce.
_Peck_, 50th Rep.

Haddonfield, N.J., 1894. Pine roots and stumps, and on ground.
Cespitose. September to frost. _McIlvaine._

A pretty species with caps up to 1½ in. across. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, ¼-⅜
in. thick, growing together (connate). The taste and smell are pleasant.
The basket is soon filled from its clusters. There is not a better
Hypholoma. The slightly soapy taste which attaches to most of the
abundant and better known species is absent in this.


=H. fascicula´ris= Huds.—_fasciculus_, a small bundle. (Plate XCVIII, p.
352.) =Pileus= about 2 in. broad, _light yellow_, the disk commonly
darker, fleshy, thin, convex, then flattened, somewhat umbonate or
obtuse, even, smooth, dry. =Flesh= _light yellow_. =Stem= very variable
in length, hollow, thin, incurved or flexuous, fibrillose, of the same
color as the pileus and flesh. =Gills= adnate, very crowded, linear,
_somewhat deliquescent, sulphur-yellow then becoming green_.

It is very easily distinguished from the preceding species by its
_bitter odor and taste, light-yellow flesh, and somewhat deliquescent,
sulphur-yellow then green gills_. It forms also more crowded clusters.
There are many remarkable varieties; one _robustior_ (more robust), stem
thickened at the base, another _nana_ (dwarf), both on the ground.

Cespitose on old stumps and the ground. Extremely common. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptical, 7×4µ _Massee_; 6–7×4µ _K._; 6×4µ _W.G.S._;
ferruginous purple, 6×4µ _Morgan_.

“It is very usual to regard this as a poisonous species, but possibly it
is not so in reality.” _Cooke._

West Virginia, 1881, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina,
_McIlvaine_.

A very common species appearing in October and lasting until well into
the winter, growing in large, overlapping masses or in tufts from old
stumps or roots, and about trees where decay has begun. Sometimes
solitary. It is then short-stemmed and sturdy. There are several closely
allied species. To know the one from the other, a careful study of the
group is necessary. (See introduction to genus, H. epixanthum, H.
sublateritium, H. capnoides, H. elæodes, and H. perplexum.) Old authors
give it as bitter and poisonous. The bitter is not always present. Any
there is disappears in cooking. It is not poisonous, but one of our most
valuable species. I have eaten it since 1881. A little lemon juice or
sherry will cover the slightly saponaceous taste sometimes present. The
caps only are good. It makes a choice pickle and a good catsup.


=H. epixan´thum= Fr. _Gr_—_epixanthos_, yellowish-brown. =Pileus= 2–3
in. broad, light-yellow or becoming pale, the disk commonly darker,
fleshy, moderately thin, convexo-plane, obtuse or gibbous, even,
_slightly silky then becoming smooth_. =Flesh= white, becoming
light-yellow. =Stem= about 8 in. long, 3–4 lines thick, _hollow_,
attenuated from the thickened base or equal; _floccose-fibrillose, pale
rust color_ or becoming dingy-brown _below_, with a frosty bloom at the
apex; veil hanging from margin of pileus, white. =Gills= adnate,
crowded, _at first light yellow-white, at length becoming ash-colored_,
not deliquescent, and not becoming purple or green.

Strong smelling, odor acid; extremely variable in stature; not
hygrophanous. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, 7×4µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina. On oak,
chestnut stumps and growing from tree roots in ground. October to
December. _McIlvaine._

(See H. perplexum, H. sublateritium and compare descriptions.)

This species, in common with its allies, is extremely hard to determine.
When growing singly from roots or from ground heavily charged with
decaying wood, it is a sturdy, solid plant; when in clusters the stem is
longer, more flexible and the whole character of the plant is modified.
Except for botanic purposes there is no occasion to puzzle over it. It
is in every way an excellent and useful fungus.


=H. disper´sus= Fr.—_dispergo_, to scatter. =Pileus= 1–1½ in. broad,
_tawny-honey-color_, not hygrophanous, _slightly fleshy_, bell-shaped
then convex, at length expanded, even, _superficially silky round the
margin_ with the veil, or squamulose, otherwise even and smooth. =Flesh=
thin, a little paler than the pileus. =Stem= 2 in. or a little more
long, 2 lines thick, tubed, equal, _tense and straight_, tough,
_fibrilloso-silky_, somewhat rust-colored, becoming dingy-brown at the
base, pale at the apex. =Gills= adnate, thin, _ventricose, broad_, 3–4
lines, _crowded, at first pallid-straw color, at length crowded_,
obsoletely green. _Fries._

Gills broader than H. fascicularis, etc. Solitary, scarcely ever
cespitose. On pine stumps and the ground. April to November.

=Spores= elliptical, 7×3–4µ _Massee_.

North Carolina, in pine woods, _Curtis_; California, _H. and M._; West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

Difficult to distinguish from H. fascicularis when growing solitary. Its
edible qualities are precisely the same.


=H. elæo´des= Fr. _Gr_—_an olive_; _Gr_—_eidos_, appearance. =Pileus=
brick-red or tan, fleshy, rather plane, somewhat umbonate, _dry,
smooth_, opaque. =Flesh= yellow. =Stem= stuffed then hollow, equal,
commonly slender, incurved or flexuous, fibrillose, of the same color as
the pileus, becoming rust-color. =Gills= adnate, crowded, thin, _green
then_ pure olivaceous.

Cespitose. Odor bitter. On trunks and on the ground. _Fries._

=Cap= 1–2 in. across. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, ¼-⅜ in. thick, stuffed then
hollow.

West Virginia, 1881–1885, Haddonfield, N.J.; Pennsylvania. On stumps,
roots and ground in woods, etc. _McIlvaine._ Not reported elsewhere.

Its habit is the same as H. fascicularis, to which it is closely allied,
and to me seems but a form of this very variable species. It is equally
good.


=H. sublateri´tium= Schaeff.—_sub_ and _later_, a brick. (Plate XCVII,
fig. 3, p. 352.) =Pileus= 2–3 in. and more broad, tawny-brick-red, but
paler round the margin and covered over with a superficial, somewhat
silky, whitish cloudiness (arising from the veil), fleshy,
convexo-plane, obtuse, _discoid_, _dry_, even, _becoming smooth_.
=Flesh= _compact_, white, then becoming yellow. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 3–5
lines thick, _stuffed, stout_ and firm, commonly manifestly attenuated
downward, rarely equal, _scaly-fibrillose_, fibrils pallid, rust-colored
downward. =Cortina= superior, at first _white, at length becoming
black_. =Gills= adnate, more or less crowded according to stature,
narrow, at first _dingy yellowish_ and darker at the base, _then sooty_,
and at length inclining to olivaceous.

=Spores= brownish purple. Somewhat cespitose. =Stem= incurved from
position. There are many varieties: _B_, somewhat solitary, the pileus
and stem, which is thickened at the base, of the same color, reddish.
_C_, smaller, pileus light yellowish, the hollow stem equal. _Schaeff._

Var. _squamo´sum_, Cooke. Pileus convex, bright brick-red, shading to
yellow at the margin, spotted with superficial scales. Flesh very thick,
yellowish. Gills narrowish, adnate. Stem elongated, stout, pale above,
rust-colored below, hollow, veil hanging from the margin when young.

On trunks. A very beautiful variety, larger and more robust than the
typical form. _Massee._

=Spores= 6×3µ. _W.G.S._; elliptical, sooty-brown, 8×4µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, 1881–1885; Pennsylvania, New Jersey, densely cespitose on
stumps and roots. October to long after frosts. _McIlvaine._

Edible. _Dr. Taylor_, 1893. Dept. of Agr. Rep. No. 5.

H. sublateritium has many forms. Both Fries and Stevenson indicate this
as a variable species and my own observation confirms the truth of this.

This is a very common autumnal species, lasting into the winter. Old
authors give it as bitter and very poisonous. I tested it in 1881 and
have been eating it, in common with all Hypholomas I have found, ever
since. At times it is bitter. I believe this to be due to the passage of
larvæ through the flesh. Unattacked specimens are slightly saponaceous
to the taste while others in the same bunch are bitter.


        VIS´CIDI. Pileus viscid, etc. (None known to be edible.)

                     Velutini. _Pileus silky, etc._


=H. veluti´nus= Pers.—_vellus_, a fleece. Velvety. =Pileus= fleshy,
thin, convex or expanded, brittle, minutely tomentose-scaly, becoming
smooth, hygrophanous, yellow with the disk reddish. =Lamellæ= rather
broad, attached, tapering toward the outer extremity, dark brown tinged
with red, the edge whitish-beaded. =Stem= equal, rather slender, hollow,
fibrillose, subconcolorous, white-mealy and slightly striate at the top.
=Spores= black.

=Height= about 2 in., breadth of pileus 1–1.5 in.

Roadsides. Albany Cemetery. September. The pileus sometimes cracks
transversely. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 6×8µ _W.G.S._; elliptical, 10×5µ _Massee_.

Often used in catsup. Innocent and edible. _Cooke._

West Virginia. 1881–1885, Pennsylvania, West Philadelphia, Bartram’s
Creek, 1887, _McIlvaine_.

Var. _leioceph´alus_ B. and Br. (_Gr_—smooth; _Gr_—head, from its smooth
pileus). =Pileus= hygrophanous, rugged, smooth except at the margin,
where it is fibrillose, pallid as is the stem, whose apex is mealy.

Densely cespitose, much smaller than the common form, but apparently a
mere variety, though a striking one from its smooth but very rugged
disk. On old stumps. _Stevenson._

New York, _Peck_, 23d Rep.; West Virginia, West Philadelphia, Bartram’s
Creek, Haddonfield, N.J., September to November. _McIlvaine._

Quantities of var. leiocephalus grow in the West Virginia forests on
stumps and on the ground from decaying roots. 1½ in. is the limit of its
width. Its frequent and dense clusters, its tenderness and delicacy of
flavor make it a favorite.


=H. aggrega´tum= Pk.—_aggrego_, to grow together. Densely cespitose.
=Pileus= thin, convex or subcampanulate, grayish-white, obscurely
spotted with appressed brownish fibrils. =Lamellæ= subdistant, rounded
behind, nearly free, at first whitish, then brown or blackish-brown with
a whitish edge. =Stem= rather long, hollow, somewhat woolly or
fibrillose, white. =Spores= brown, elliptical, 8×4–5µ.

=Pileus= about 1 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 1.5–2 lines thick.

At the base of trees and stumps in woods. Alcove. September.

The cespitose habit and obscurely spotted grayish-white pileus are
marked features of this species. From H. silvestre the species may be
distinguished by its smaller size, adnexed or nearly free lamellæ which
have no rosy tint, and by its very cespitose mode of growth. _Peck_,
46th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., about trees and stumps. September to November,
1898–1899. _McIlvaine._ Not reported elsewhere.

The caps are oyster-color. Amateurs accustomed to the gayer colors of
the autumnal Hypholomas will not suspect this of belonging to the genus,
until the color of the spores is obtained.

The caps are fine.


=H. lachrymabun´dum= Fr.—_lachryma_, a tear. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad,
whitish when young, then dingy-brown, becoming pale around the margin,
truly fleshy but not compact, convex, obtuse, scaly with hairs, the
innate scales darker. =Flesh= white. =Stem= 2 in. long, 3–4 lines thick,
hollow, somewhat thickened at the base, scaly with fibrils, becoming
brownish-whitish. =Veil= separate, clothed with fibers, hanging from the
pileus, white. =Gills= adnate, crowded, 3 lines broad, whitish then
brownish-purple, edge whitish and distilling drops in wet weather.

=Spores= brownish-purple. From mutual pressure the caps are often
irregular. Very cespitose, firm. _Fries._

=Spores= brownish-purple, 9×4µ _Massee_.

On ground and on trunks. Truly cespitose. Smaller than H. velutinus, but
firmer, truly fleshy, not hygrophanous. Bushy pastures. Bethlehem.
October.

Our specimens do not agree in all respects with the published
description of the species. The pileus is sometimes wholly destitute of
scales and sometimes densely clothed with hairy, erect ones. The species
is manifestly variable. _Peck_, 30th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

“Like H. fascicularis in quality. Intensely irritant. It is bound with
the weight of its own guilt.” _Hay._

This is a good specimen of Hay’s comments. H. fascicularis is never
irritant, is good eating, is innocent.

There is irony in the comment of Dr. Cooke: “This doubtful species is
used by the smaller ketchup makers.”

I have not seen this species. When I do I shall eat it and expect to
live.


              APPENDICULA´TI. Pileus hygrophanous, smooth.


=H. incer´tum= Pk. (Plate XCVII_a_.) =Pileus= fragile, convex or
subcampanulate, then expanded, hygrophanous, often radiately wrinkled,
whitish with the disk yellowish, the thin margin sometimes
purplish-tinted, often wavy, adorned by fragments of the white
flocculent fugacious veil. =Lamellæ= close, narrow, whitish then
rosy-brown, the edge often uneven. =Stem= equal, straight, hollow,
easily splitting, whitish with a frosty bloom or slightly scurfy at the
top. =Spores= elliptical, purplish-brown, 8×5µ.

=Plant= gregarious or subcespitose, 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2 in.
broad. =Stem= 1–2 lines thick.

Ground among bushes. Green Island and Sandlake. June and July.

The veil is sometimes so strongly developed as to form an imperfect
ring. The color is nearly white from the first. _Peck_, 29th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

As the name indicates, I was uncertain whether this was a form of H.
Candolleanum, to which it is very closely related, but as Fries says of
that “Gills at first violaceous,” and as our plant has them at first
white or whitish, I concluded to risk the uncertainty on a new species.

I have seen Central Park, New York, well covered with it in May. It is
also common in the vicinity of Boston. Of very agreeable flavor and
delicate substance. The profusion of its growth compensates for its
small size. _Macadam._

Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; Mt. Gretna, Pa., in great clusters between
railroad ties and beside track, _McIlvaine_.

Tender. One of the best.

=H. appendicula´tum= Bull.—a small appendage. From the veil adhering to
margin of pileus. (Plate XCVII, p. 352.) =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad,
date-brown then tawny, becoming pale yellowish when dry,
fleshy-membranaceous, thin, ovate then expanded, at length flattened,
obtuse, smooth, when dry slightly wrinkled, somewhat sprinkled with
atoms. =Stem= 3 in. long, 2–3 lines thick, fistulose, equal, smooth,
white, _pruinate at the apex_; veil fringing the margin of the pileus,
fugacious, white. =Gills= somewhat adnate, crowded, _dry, white_ then
flesh-colored, at length dingy-brown.

Densely cespitose, very fragile and hygrophanous. Much thinner and more
fragile than H. Candolleanus. It may be safely distinguished from
species which are nearest to it by the gills being whitish then
brownish-flesh color.

Var. _lana´tum_. A curious form, densely woolly when young, traces of
the woolly coat remaining at the apex when the pileus is fully expanded.
Sibbertoft. B. and Br., 1876. _Stevenson._

=Spores= ellipsoid, pellucid, 6–8×3–4µ _K._; 4×6µ _W.G.S._; elliptical,
5×2.5µ _Massee_.

Angora, West Philadelphia, October, November, December, 1897;
Haddonfield, N.J., Mt. Gretna, Pa., cespitose and gregarious in woods
about stumps. _McIlvaine._

“It is very common and edible.” _Farlow._

At Mt. Gretna, Pa., October, 1898, in great abundance. When found it was
gregarious in large patches and cespitose on stumps. My identification
was confirmed by Professor Peck.

It dries well, and retains flavor and esculent qualities. Cooked it is
among the best.


=H. Candol´leanum= Fr.—After De Candolle. =Pileus= 2–4 in. broad,
date-brown then becoming white, the top somewhat yellowish, somewhat
fleshy, acorn-shaped then bell-shaped, soon convex and at length
flattened, obtuse and unequal, smooth, even. =Flesh= thin, white. =Stem=
3 in. long, 2–4 lines thick, fistulose, solid at the base, somewhat
thickened, fibrillose, white, striate at the apex; veil in the form of a
cortina, web-like, appendiculate (depending from the margin of the
pileus), white, at length becoming dingy-brown. =Gills= rounded-adnexed,
then separating, crowded, violaceous then brownish-cinnamon, the edge at
first whitish.

Readily distinguished from neighboring species by the gills being at
first beautifully dark violaceous, never flesh-colored. Densely
cespitose, fragile, very hygrophanous. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptical, 8×4µ _Massee_.

Edible, often used in catsup. _Cooke._

A species variable in color with the weather. Its gills are
cream-colored at first, then purplish, then very dark. After rain the
fragile cap often turns up at the margin and splits.

It differs somewhat in texture from other Hypholomas, being more
delicate in texture and substance. It is excellent.


=H. suba´quilum= Banning.—_aquilus_, brownish, tawny. =Pileus= brown,
convex, smooth, hygrophanous, often shaded into ocher at margin, veil
delicate, silk-like, encircling and covering the marginal extremities of
the lamellæ but forming no ring on the stem. =Flesh= white, turning
umber when cut. =Lamellæ= adnexed or nearly free, close, forked, umber.
=Stem= cespitose, regular, hollow, silky, white, 2–3 in. long.

=Spores= brown, 4×5µ. _Banning_ MS.

Druid Hill Park, Baltimore, _Miss Banning_; decaying wood, Adirondack
mountains. August and September. New York. _Peck_, 45th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

H. subaquilum is closely allied to H. appendiculatum, but is
distinguished by its darker colored cap and gills.

Its edible qualities are the same. It is among the best.

                            =PSILO´CYBE= Fr.

_Gr_—naked; head.


=Pileus= more or less fleshy, smooth, _margin at first incurved_.
=Gills= becoming brownish or purple. =Stem= somewhat cartilaginous,
rigid or tough, tubular, hollow or stuffed, often rooting. =Veil= absent
or rudimentary, never forming a membrane. =Spores= purple, purple-brown
or slate-color.

Generally growing on the ground, gregarious, sometimes cespitose.

Psilocybe is analogous in form to Collybia, Leptonia and Naucoria, which
are distinguished by their spore colors. Separated from Psathyra by the
incurved margin of the pileus.

But one species of Psilocybe is herein given as edible. Of it, alone,
the writer has had opportunity to eat meals. Several others of the
species have been found by him and tested in small quantity. They are
all of good texture, substance and flavor, though most are small. He is
of the opinion that increased testing will prove the entire genus
edible. Nothing can or should be prognosticated about a toadstool, but
the indications are all in favor of Psilocybe.

Var. _polyceph´alus_ Fr.—_polus_, many; _cephale_, head.

Densely crowded. Stem thinner, flexuous. Gills nearly free, at length

The plant is tender, cooks easily and is of fine flavor.


=P. semilancea´ta= Fr.—_semi_, half; _lancea_, a spear. =Pileus= ½ in.
high, not broad, various in color, becoming yellow, green, dingy-brown,
somewhat membranaceous, _acutely conical_, almost _cuspidate_, never
expanded, but the margin when young at first bent inward, _covered with
a pellicle which is viscous and separable in wet weather_, slightly
striate chiefly round the margin. =Stem= as much as 3 in. long, scarcely
1 line thick, tubular and _containing a pith_, equal, more frequently
_flexuous_, smooth, _capable of being_ twisted round the finger, smooth,
_becoming pale; furnished with a veil when young_. =Gills= _ascending_

purple-black. _Fries._

Gregarious, very tough. Pastures and roadsides, etc. Common. August to
November. _Stevenson._

New York, _Peck_, Rep. 23; Novia Scotia, _Somers_.

Var. _cærules´cens_ Cooke—becoming blue. Base of stem turning
indigo-blue.

Not common in America, but frequently found. According to M. C. Cooke—a
careful authority—P. semilanceata has a dangerous reputation. It is said
to have proved fatal to children when eaten raw. It is not deleterious
when cooked.

Psathyra corresponds with Mycena, Nolanea, Galera and Psathyrella. All
the species grow on the ground or on trunks. _Stevenson._

But four American species reported. Small and unimportant.




                              =DECONICA.=

Few American species. Small and unimportant.




   _Series V._ =MELANOS´PORÆ= (spores black). _Gr_—black; _Gr_—seed.


Various as are the spore colors in this series (in its broadest sense),
there is an entire absence of brown and purple shades in the black
spores of four of the genera belonging to this group or series. In
Gomphidius the spores are dingy-olivaceous. It is an outsider
affiliating with thoroughbreds because of more technical congeniality
than other genera afford. Like comets in the universe, it has no home.
The singular genus Montagnites (of which but one species has been found
in America, and that in Texas) has the relationship of spore-color.
Panæolus, Anellaria, Psathyrella, when young, have gills free from each
other; Coprinus, in early life, presents them pressed tightly together;
as the plants age and the spores ripen, the entire gill structure
becomes black and dissolves into an inky fluid, the color of which is
due to the spores.

The species are all of delicate body, and many of them add generously to
table luxuries.




                           =COPRI´NUS= Pers.

                               _Gr_—dung.


=Pileus= separate from the stem. =Gills= membranaceous, at first closely
pressed together, cohering, at length melting into a black fluid.
=Trama= obsolete. =Spores= oval, even, black.

The extreme closeness of the gills and their entire deliquescence into a
fluid, black from the spores, sharply define this genus and separate it
from all others. At first the form is oval or cylindrical; most are
furnished with a downy or scurfy veil often adhering to the pileus,
sometimes forming an adhering volva at the base of the stem. Nearly all
are ephemeral, many completely disappearing in a day.

Cystidia (sterile cells) of large size are frequent on the gills of many
species.

The majority grow on richly manured ground or dung, some on rotten wood
and other materials. Bolbitius, the only ally, has the same ephemeral
existence, and grows in similar situations, but the gills only soften
(not melting) and the spores are somewhat rust-colored.

The blackening of the gills is not a process of decay, but is due to the
growth of the spores, and the plant is still (before deliquescence)
perfectly edible although not so inviting in appearance as before.

Species of Coprinus are very common and are easily recognized by the
deliquescent gills which, when mature, stain the fingers black.

In “Once upon a Time,” when country people made their own writing inks,
the convenient Coprinus gave its juices for this purpose. A little
corrosive sublimate added to the boiled and strained fluid prevented it
from molding.

With few exceptions the species are small. They are tender, of real
mushroom flavor and highly enjoyable. They make a thin, well flavored
catsup, but are better used to give flavor to their less favored
brethren.

They stew in from two to fifteen minutes, depending upon the solidity of
the species.

                        ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBES.

         _A._ PELLICULOSI (_pellicula_, a thin skin). Page 370.

Gills covered above with a fleshy or membranaceous skin, hence the
pileus does not split along the lines of the gills, but becomes
lacerated with the edges turned upward.

* Comati—_coma_, hair. Furnished with a ring formed from the free margin
of the volva. The skin of the pileus torn into innate scales.

** Atramentarii—_atramentum_, ink. Ring imperfect. Volva absent. Pileus
dotted with minute innate scales.

*** Picacei—_pica_, a magpie. Universal veil downy, at first continuous
then broken up into superficial scales forming patches on the pileus.

**** Tomentosi—_tomentum_, down. Pileus at first covered with a loose
hairy down, becoming torn into distinct scales, at length disappearing.
Ring absent.

***** Micacei—_mico_, to glitter. Pileus at first covered with minute
glistening scales, soon disappearing. Ring none.

****** Glabrati. Pileus smooth. Veil absent.

      _B._ VELIFORMES (_velum_, a veil; _forma_, form). Page 380.

Pileus very thin without a skin, at length opening into furrows along
the backs of the gills and becoming folded in furrows. Stem thin,
hollow. Gills wasting away into thin lines.

* Cyclodei. _Gr_—a circle; appearance. Stem with a ring or volva.

** Lanatuli—_lanatus_, woolly. Pileus covered with superficial woolly
floccules, at length disappearing. Ringless.

*** Furfurelli—_furfureus_, branny. Pileus mealy or scurfy. Gills
generally attached to a collar at the apex of the stem. Ringless.

**** Hemerobii. _Gr_.—living a day. Pileus always smooth.

None known to be edible.

line of the gills, the cuticle, except upon the apex, separating into
shaggy, often concentric scales, at times yellowish, at others tinged
with purplish-black. =Gills= free from the stem, crowded and at first
cohering, broad, white then tinged with pink or salmon color, then
purple to black and dissolving into ink. =Stem= up to 10 in. long, up to
⅝ in. thick, attenuated upward, most part concealed within the cap,
hollow, but with spider-web threads within, smooth or fibrillose, white
or lilac-white, easily pulling out of cap, brittle. =Ring= thin, torn,
sometimes entire and movable.

On rich soil, lawns, gardens, roads, dumps, especially where ashes have

Coprinus comatus is common to the United States. In its perfection it is
a stately and beautiful plant. I have seen it with the oblong cap eight
inches long, but its usual height is from 2–4 in. It occurs after hard
rain and often in the most unexpected places. It is a rather domestic
species, usually in troops, but often in clusters of from five to fifty
individuals. I have seen it lift firmly sodded ground about railroad
stations, and again, bulging the surface of gardens like mole-hills.

There are toadstools of higher flavor, but not one of greater delicacy.
In this C. comatus is not excelled from its earliest stage until fully
ripened. It is everywhere commended.

Lafayette B. Mendel, in American Journal of Physiology, gives the
following analysis:

The specimens were freshly gathered and had not yet turned “inky.” They
varied very widely in size, thirty-six mushrooms weighing 1485 grams, of
which 980 grams belonged to the caps (pileus) and 505 grams to the
stems. The average weight of a fresh specimen was thus:

              Pileus                        27 grams
              Stem                          14
                                             —
                           Total weight     41

A specimen which had attained the average growth weighed:

              Pileus                        43 grams
              Stem                          25
                                             —
                           Total weight     68

An analysis yielded the following results:

              Water                      92.19 per cent.
              Total solids                7.81

The dry substance contained:

white, toward the apex tinged with pale brown, scales darker. =Flesh=
very thin. =Gills= free, tapering toward each end, ¼ in. or more broad,
crowded, pale then blackish. =Stem= 5–8 in. long, ¾ in. thick at the
base, slightly attenuated upward, silky-white, stuffed; toward the base
there is a depressed zone caused by the edge of the pileus when young.
=Ring= fugacious. =Spores= elliptical, 15×7µ.

Amongst grass near to trunks, buried wood, etc. A very large and
beautiful species, distinguished from Coprinus atramentarius, its
nearest ally, by the larger size of every part, the costate (ribbed) or
waved lower portion of the pileus, the truncate, depressed disk, with
distinct squamules, the whitish color of the pileus, and the imperfectly
hollow or stuffed stem.

=Spores= elliptical, 15×7µ _Massee_.

Almshouse grounds, Philadelphia. On maple roots in grass-grown places,
May, 1897–1898. _McIlvaine._ Not previously noted in United States.

C. soboliferus is a substantial food-giving species, very heavy for its
size. It grows singly and in clusters and will immediately attract
attention, wherever found. It is of fine flavor and substance. Cook at
once.


=C. ova´tus= (Schaeff.) Fr.—_ovum_, an egg. =Pileus= white, somewhat
membranaceous, _at the first egg-shaped and densely imbricated with
thick spreading concentric scales_, covered with an even hood at the
apex, then expanded, striate. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, solid at the base,
rooting, otherwise hollow, with spider-web threads within, attenuated
upward, downy, shining white. =Ring= not very conspicuous and soon
vanishing. =Gills= free, remote, slightly ventricose, at the first
somewhat naked and remaining long shining white, _at length
umber-blackish_, never becoming purple.

Smaller, thinner, less handsome than C. comatus. For the most part
solitary. _Fries._

=Spores= 11–12×7–8µ _Massee_.

On rich ground, dumps, etc. Same habitat as C. comatus.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey. _McIlvaine._

So closely allied to C. comatus that it is with difficulty distinguished
from it. However, its edible qualities are the same, and into these the
name does not enter.

=C. sterquili´nus= Fr.—_sterquilinium_, a dunghill. =Pileus= about 2 in.
across when expanded, conical, then expanded, sulcate more than half way
from margin to disk, at first villous or silky, disk rather fleshy with
rough scales, silvery-gray, tinged with brown at the apex. =Flesh= thin.
=Gills= free, ventricose, about 2 lines broad, pale then umber-purple.
=Stem= 4–6 in. high, slightly attenuated upward, white, fibrillose,
hollow, thickened base solid, and booted for about an inch from the
base, margin of sheath ending in a free border or ring.

On dung. A fine large species known by the scaly apex of the pileus, the
basal portion of the stem surrounded by a volva-like, adnate structure
with a free upper margin. The stem soon becomes black when bruised. Base
of stem not rooting but abrupt, and furnished with a few white fibers.
_Massee._

Edible, _Cooke_, 1891; also _Leuba_.

This species is not reported as found in the United States.


                ** Atramentarii. _Ring imperfect, etc._

=C. atramenta´rius= (Bull.) Fr.—_atramentum_, ink. (Plate CII, fig. 1,
p. 372.) =Pileus= 1½-4 in. across, ovate, expanding, grayish, lead-color
or grayish-brown, with occasionally a few obscure scales on disk, often
covered with bloom; margin ribbed, sometimes notched, soft, tender.
=Gills= free, ventricose, up to ½ in. broad, crowded and at first
cohering and white with white floccose edges, then becoming black and
dissolving into ink. =Stem= up to 5 in. long, up to ½ in. thick, smooth,
whitish, hollow, at first spindle-shaped, then attenuated upward, with
more or less distinct ring near base.

=Spores= subcylindrical, large cystidia numerous, 12×6µ _Massee_;
9–10×6µ _K._; 9×5µ _W.G.S._; 8–10µ long _Peck_.

Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; Harrisburg, Pa., _Dr. J.H. Fager_; West
Virginia, _McIlvaine_.

The stem is obscurely banded within, by which it may be recognized with
certainty.

It grows singly or in clusters of many individuals on rich ground,
whether lawns, gardens, gutter sides, or in woods, but not on dung. I
know of a fine cluster growing year after year on a much-decayed
pear-stump. Occasionally it appears in the spring months, but is common
during the summer and autumn after rains, and from its first appearance
it occurs in successive crops until stopped by severe frost. It is
common in Europe and over the United States.

The flavor is higher than that of C. comatus. It should be cooked as
soon as gathered, and kept in a cool place until needed.

Analysis shows the following:

Two separate, freshly-gathered lots of this species were examined. The
one (_a_) contained six young small specimens weighing 5.5 grams, or .9
gram each; the other (_b_) contained eight mushrooms weighing 12 grams,
or 1.5 grams each. An analysis gave:

=C. fusces´cens= (Schaeff.) Fr.—_fuscus_, dark or swarthy. =Pileus= 1–1¼
in. across, submembranaceous, ovate, expanded, dull, disk rather fleshy,
even or cracked into squamules, grayish-brown, disk reddish. =Gills=
adfixed, blackish-umber. =Stem= 4–5 in. long, about ¼ in. thick, equal,
fragile, hollow, subfibrillose. =Ring= indistinct or absent, whitish.
_Massee._

Smaller and more slender than Coprinus atramentarius. =Pileus=
brownish-gray, disk becoming reddish, not sprinkled with micaceous
particles, but at first covered with a mealy bloom. =Gills= adnexed,
attenuated from the stem to the margin, deliquescent. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, pointed at the ends, 10x6µ _Massee_; 10x5µ _W.G.S._

Solitary and in tufts. On stumps, trunks, etc. May to October.

West Philadelphia, Pa., _McIlvaine_.

C. fuscescens is tender, delicate and of excellent flavor. In this it
ranks with C. atramentarius.

[Illustration:

  COPRINUS MACROSPORUS.
  Enlarged one-third.
]


=C. macro´sporus= Pk. =Pileus= ovate, then expanded, rimose-striate
(cracked in lines), obscurely floccose-squamulose, white, the small even
brownish disk scaly. =Lamellæ= crowded, free, white then black. =Stem=
glabrous, white, with traces of an annulus (ring) near the thickened or
subbulbous base.

=Spores= very large, elliptical, 20–20.5 long, 12–16µ broad.

=Plant= cespitose, 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1 line
thick.

Ground in open fields. Ticonderoga. August.

The prominent characters of this species are the cracked pileus,
squamose disk, free lamellæ and large spores. In its early state it
resembles some species of Lepiota. It seems to be intermediate between
the sections Atramentarii and Micacei. _Peck_, 31st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found in quantity at Mt. Gretna, Pa. August to September, 1898, growing
among old stable bedding on parade ground.

C. macrosporus is an excellent species, higher in flavor than any other
Coprinus.


               *** Pica´cei. _Universal downy veil, etc._


=C. pica´ceus= (Bull.) Fr. =Pileus= 2–2½ in. across, membranaceous,
ovato-bell-shaped, striate up to the disk, smoky-black, variegated with
large, irregular, superficial white patches. =Gills= free, ½ in. or more
broad, ventricose, grayish-black. =Stem= 5–6 in. long, base bulbous,
abrupt, otherwise equal, ¼-⅔ in. thick, white, hollow, fragile, smooth.
=Spores= elliptical, apiculate, 14×8µ; cystidia large, numerous.
_Massee._

Decaying trunks or branches of trees in woods. Lyndonville. June.
_Fairman._

The form here referred to this species differs somewhat from the
description of the type in being smaller, in having no bulb to the stem
and in having smaller spores. It is probably the “smaller variety
growing on rotten wood” noticed by Stevenson in his British Fungi. I
have seen the true form of the species from Kansas. The New York plant
seems to me to be worthy of distinctive designation, at least as a
variety, and I call it

Var. _ebulbo´sus_. Plant smaller. =Stem= destitute of a bulb. =Spores=
8–10×5µ. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Minnesota, _Johnson_, 1897; Kansas, _Cragin_, 1884; Wisconsin, _Bundy_,
Nebraska, _Clements_.

Edible. _Leuba._

Large quantities grew on rotting chestnut and oak rails at Mt. Gretna,
Pa., from June to August, 1899. It is strong and unpleasant.


   **** Tomento´si. _Pileus at first veiled with a loose hairy veil._


(Plate CV.)

[Illustration: COPRINUS FIMETARIUS.]

=C. fimeta´rius= Fr.—_fimetum_, a dunghill. =Pileus= 1–2 in. across,
membranaceous, thin, _at first cylindrical_, soon conical, _the edge at
length revolute_ and torn at the margin, _when young everywhere covered
with floccose-squarrose white scales_ (from the universal veil), which
separate from the vertex toward the circumference, at length naked,
longitudinally cracked, but not opening into furrows, the vertex which
remains entire, livid. =Stem= about 3 in. long, 2–3 lines and more
thick, hollow, fragile, _thickened and solid at the base_, attenuated
upward, shining white and downy with squamules of the same color.
=Gills= free, reaching the stem, at first _ventricose, then linear,
flexuous, black_. =Stem= when young curt and firmer. _Fries_.

=Spores= spheroid-ellipsoid, 15–18×9–12µ _K._; 15×9µ _W.G.S._;
12–14×7–8µ _Massee_.

Sometimes there is a root as long as the stem. _M.J.B._ Common on dung
heaps in successive crops. Spring to autumn.

Var. _pulla´tus_. =Pileus= with adpressed scales and tomentose, soon
naked, brownish, then blackish. =Stem= equal, becoming smooth.

On dung. Clustered. Stature of the type.

Var. _cine´reus_. =Pileus= membranaceous, floccosely mealy, then naked,
ashy-gray. =Stem= subequal, rootless, hollow to the base, often twisted.
=Spores= 12–8µ.

On dung and rich soil.

Var. _macrorhi´za_. =Pileus= at first with feathery squamules. =Stem=
short, hairy, rooting, sometimes more or less marginately subbulbous.
=Spores= 13–14×8–9µ.

On dung. Pileus pale and smaller than in the typical form, stem shorter,
with a more or less elongated rooting base. _Berkeley._

Of this very variable species there is a small form growing on decayed
wood in woods. It has the spores rather smaller than in the type, they
being 10–11µ long, 8µ broad. It might be designated Var. _silvi´cola_.
_Peck_, 43d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, 1881–1885, May to October. _McIlvaine._

Common to the United States. Of excellent flavor and tender. It must be
cooked at once.


=C. tomento´sus= (Bull.) Fr.—_tomentum_, pubescence. =Pileus= very thin,
at first oblong-oval and floccose-scaly, soon bell-shaped, naked,
closely striate, grayish-brown or blackish-brown, often with a leaden
hue, finally expanded, the disk smooth, reddish or ochraceous-brown, the
margin turned upwards and much split or lacerated. =Lamellæ= closely
crowded, narrow, free, white then pinkish, finally black. =Stem= white,
tall, fragile, tapering upward, finely floccose-squamulose, hollow,
sometimes with a large tap root. =Plant= gregarious or cespitose.

=Height= 3–6 in., breadth of pileus 6–18 lines.

Very variable in size and color. The covering of the pileus is easily
rubbed off. It soon disappears and the plant quickly decays, seldom
continuing through the day. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., about old picketing places in camp grounds. _Prof. M.W.
Easton_, July, 1898.

West Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, May to
September, on dung, rich ground, gardens and in woods. _McIlvaine._

Very delicate; of strong mushroom flavor. It is common, and can usually
be collected in numbers. It is of little food value in itself, but
yields an excellent flavor to anything it is cooked with. It must be
cooked as soon as gathered.


=C. ni´veus= Fr.—_nix_, snow. =Pileus= white, 1–2 in. across, thin,
ovate then bell-shaped, margin at length turned upward, split or covered
with a dense white, mealy or downy covering, slightly pink. =Gills=
_adnexed_, narrow, crowded, at first cohering, white then pinkish, then
black. =Stem= at first short, then up to 4 in., slender, attenuated
upward, covered with white down, fragile, hollow.

=Spores= 16×11–13µ _Massee_; 10×12µ _W.G.S._

Common on dung and dung heaps, clustered. May to frost.

West Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. _McIlvaine._

Very variable in size, but clearly distinguished by its snow-white color
and adnexed gills. Like all of the thin, delicate species of this genus
there is little substance left after cooking, but the savory flavor is
imparted to the cooking medium.


 ***** Mica´cei. _Pileus at first covered with minute, glistening scales,
                                  etc._


=C. mica´ceus= (Bull.) Fr.—_mica_, grain, granular. (Plate CII, fig. 2,
p. 372.) =Pileus= thin, ovate, then bell-shaped, with the margin more or
less revolute, wavy, splitting, closely striate, with a few minute
scales and sparkling atoms, or naked, varying in color from
whitish-ochraceous to livid-brown, generally darker when moist or old.
=Gills= rather narrow, crowded, white then pinkish, finally black.
=Stem= slender, fragile, easily splitting, slightly silky, white,
hollow, often twisted. Plant mostly cespitose.

=Height= 2–4 in., breadth of pileus, 1–2 in.

Streets, yards and fields, on or about old stumps. May to September.
_Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= elliptical, blackish, 7–8×4–5µ _Massee_; 7×8µ _W.G.S._; 10×5µ
_W.P._; elliptical, brown, 6–8µ _Peck_.

Var. _granula´ris_. Pileus sprinkled with granules or furfuraceous
scales. New York. August. _Peck_, 47th Rep.

Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; West Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey. May to October. _McIlvaine._

Common from spring until frost. This is the oval-capped toadstool found
in clusters about trees, posts, along grassy sides of pavements, popping
up, Brownie-like, from sodded places. Although small and thin, its
clusters soon fill baskets, and its continuous growth in some places,
from month to month, year to year, makes it one to be depended upon.
Stewed for ten minutes it makes a rich, luscious dish. C. congregatus
closely resembles it and is equally good.


                ****** Glabra´ti. _Pileus smooth, etc._


=C. deliques´cens= (Bull.) Fr. =Pileus= 3–4 in. broad, livid-fuliginous,
membranaceous, bell-shaped then expanded, smooth, but _dotted with
minute points on the disk_, never downy or split, the edge turning
upward and striate, the striæ broad but not deep. =Stem= 4 in. long, 2–4
lines thick, hollow, with a bark-like covering, equally attenuated
upward, _smooth, shining white_. =Gills= free, _at length remote from
the stem_, very crowded, flexuous, very narrow, only ½ line broad,
lurid-blackish. _Fries._

Frequent on stumps and among fallen leaves, sometimes in tufts. July to
October.

=Spores= elliptical, obliquely apiculate, 8×5µ _Massee_.

Sometimes confounded with C. atramentarius.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

C. deliquescens is of good size and quality. The stems do not cook well
with the caps. The flavor is the same as C. atramentarius.


=C. congrega´tus= (Bull.) Fr. =Pileus= ½-¾ in. high, cylindrical, then
bell-shaped, finally expanded and split at the margin, smooth, viscid,
margin slightly striate, ochraceous. =Gills= about 1 line broad,
slightly adnexed, white, finally becoming black. =Stem= 1½ in. high,
equal, smooth, hollow, whitish.

On the ground, also in hot-houses. _Massee._

Readily distinguished by the densely cespitose mode of growth, the small
size, the viscid, ochraceous, glabrous pileus which remains
elongato-cylindrical for some time, then becomes campanulate and finally
expands and splits at the margin.

Densely cespitose, fragile, readily distinguished from C. digitalis by
its much smaller size. _Fries._

=Spores= 7×8µ _W.G.S._; 10×5µ _W.P._

Fries and Cooke considered this a good species.

So closely allied to neighboring species that it is difficult to
determine it. Edible qualities are included in the alliance.


                _B._ VELIFORMES. Pileus very thin, etc.

                 * Cyclodei. _Stem bearing ring, etc._

None edible.


      ** Lanatuli. _Pileus with superficial downy covering, etc._


=C. lagopus= Fr.—_Gr_, a hare; a foot. =Pileus= 1 in. broad, whitish,
disk livid, very tender, cylindrical then bell-shaped, when young
beautifully downy then naked, flattened and split, radiately furrowed.
=Stem= 5 in. and more long, 1 line thick, very weak, very fragile,
slightly attenuated at both ends, everywhere white-woolly. =Gills= at
length remote, narrow, black. _Fries._

Fries distinguishes two forms. A, _nemorum_. =Stem= slender, 4–6 in.
long. B, _viarum_. =Stem= 2–3 in. long. =Pileus= broader, livid. Both
forms are inodorous. The pileus of the long-stemmed form is sometimes
entirely clear brown, at others grayish with a brownish disk. =Stem=
very weak, 5 in. and more in length, 1 line thick, attenuated at both
ends. =Pileus= thin, expanded bell-shaped, about 1 in. across, when
young elegantly flocculose, then furrowed, disk livid. =Gills= rather
distant.

New York, _Peck_, 38th Rep.; Mt. Gretna, Pa., July, 1898, on rubbish
about abandoned camp. _Prof. M.W. Easton._

A strikingly beautiful species. Both forms were found in abundance,
tested and eaten with enjoyment. They are extremely delicate, and of
attractive but not high flavor.


=C. Virgineus= Banning. =Pileus= ovate, bell-shaped, or cylindrical,
pale ocher, the margin thin, torn, downy. =Lamellæ= narrow, close,
forked, at first white, turning dark but never black, adnexed. =Stem= 3½
in. long, stout, somewhat stuffed, attenuated where it meets the pileus,
flattened, downy. =Spores= black.

Cespitose or gregarious at the roots of trees or about old stumps. Also
found in Virginia.

The plant is not rapidly deliquescent, remaining perfect for some hours.
_Banning_ MS.

Maryland. Virginia. _Miss M.E. Banning_ MS. _Peck_, 44th Rep.

Chester county, Pa. New Jersey, about pear trees and stumps.
_McIlvaine._

This little Coprinus is a valuable species when found. A patch of it
about a tree or stump is treasure trove. Patches of it appear in July
and bear until October. The not-particular observer would mistake it for
C. micaceus.


          *** Furfurel´li. _Pileus micaceous or scurfy, etc._


(Plate CVI.)

[Illustration:

  COPRINUS DOMESTICUS.
  Natural size.
]

=C. domes´ticus= (Pers.) Fr.—_domus_, a house. =Pileus= 2 in. broad,
fuliginous, disk date-brown, thin, ovate then bell-shaped, _covered with
small branny scales_, then opening into furrows and flattened,
_undulately sulcate_, disk obtuse, even. Stem 2–3 in. long, 2–3 lines
thick, fistulose, slightly firm, attenuated upward, _adpressedly silky_,
becoming even, white. =Gills= _adnexed_, at first crowded, distant when
the pileus is split, linear, _white then reddish_, at length
brownish-blackish.

A larger and more remarkable species than all the neighboring ones.
_Fries._

=Spores= 14–16×7–8µ _Massee_.

On much decayed wood, damp carpets, in cellars, etc. Often in clusters.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., _Prof. M.W. Easton_, July, 1898; West Virginia, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

C. domesticus is the largest of its section and is sometimes of
remarkable growth. I have seen it start from under a board in a cellar
and prolong its stems for over a foot to get its caps to air and light.
Under such conditions the stems are twisted in a confused mass.

It is very tender with a decided mushroom flavor. Cook at once.


(Plate CVII.)

[Illustration:

  COPRINUS SILVATICUS.
  Enlarged one-fourth.
  (After Peck.)
]

=C. silvat´icus= Pk. =Pileus= membranaceous, with a thin fleshy disk,
convex, striate in folds on the margin, dark-brown, the depressed striæ
paler. =Lamellæ= subdistant, narrow, attached to the stem, brownish.
=Stem= fragile, slender, smooth, hollow, white. =Spores= gibbous-ovate,
12.7µ long.

=Plant= 2 in. high. =Pileus= 6–10 lines broad. =Stem= .5 lines thick.
Ground in woods. Greig. September.

The striæ extend about half way up the pileus. Allied to C. plicatilis
and C. ephemerus _Peck_, 24th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. Frequent, but not common. On
ground in woods, August to October. _McIlvaine._

This pretty little fungus is frequently found. I have never been able to
get it in quantity, but have often eaten it. Its flavor is musky, rather
strong. It is edible, but is not obtainable in sufficient numbers to
make it of much food value.


=C. ephem´erus= Fr. _Gr_—lasting for a day. =Pileus= ½-¾ in. across,
very thin, ovate, then bell-shaped, finally expanded and splitting,
furrowed radiately, at first slightly scurfy, disk elevated, even,
reddish. =Gills= slightly attached, linear, white, then brownish, at
length blackish. =Stem= 1½-2½ in. high, 1 line or more thick, equal,
glabrous, pellucid, hollow, whitish. =Spores= 16–17×9–10µ.

On dunghills, manured ground, etc. To the naked eye appearing almost
glabrous, but under a lens seen to be distinctly scurfy. Known from
Coprinus plicatilis by the disk of the pileus being prominent and not
depressed. _Massee._

Common dung and dung heaps. May to October. New York, _Peck._ 23d Rep.

Of such size and delicate substance as to be of little food value. But
it has a strong mushroom flavor which is choice as a flavoring. It
appears during the summer months on dung and dung heaps. It must be
cooked as soon as gathered.


=C. semilana´tus= Pk. =Pileus= submembranaceous, broadly conical, then
expanded and strongly revolute, and the margin sometimes split, covered
with mealy atoms, finely and obscurely rimose-striate, pale
grayish-brown. =Lamellæ= narrow, close, free. =Stem= elongated, fragile,
hollow, slightly tapering upward, white, the lower half clothed with
loose cottony flocci which rub off easily, the upper half smooth or
slightly farinaceous. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 12.7µ long.

=Plant= very fragile, 4–6 in. high. =Pileus= 8–12 lines broad. =Stem= 1
line thick at the base. Rich ground and dung. Sandlake. August. (Plate
IV, fig. 15–18.) Allied to C. coopertus. _Peck_, 24th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

West Virginia. 1881–1885, Mt. Gretna, Pa. July to October. _McIlvaine._

I have seldom found it, though at times it was quite common about
stables in West Virginia. It has good mushroom flavor and is edible. It
is stately, attracting attention by its peculiar cap.


=C. plica´tilis= Fr.—_plico_, to fold. =Pileus= 1 in. broad, dusky-brown
then bluish-gray-cinereous, _disk darker_, dusky-brown or reddish,
oval-cylindrical then campanulate, soon expanded, opening into furrows,
_sulcate-plicate_, for the most part _smooth, disk broad_, even, _at
length depressed_. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, fistulose, thin, equal, even,
_smooth_, pallid, _somewhat pellucid_. =Gills= _remote from the stem_
and adnate to a _collar_ which is formed from the dilated apex of the
stem, distant, gray-blackish. _Fries._

Very tender and fragile, but when scorched by the sun not melting into
fluid. Very variable in stature and size. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 12–14×8–10µ _Massee_; broadly elliptic, 5µ long, _M.J.B._;
11–13µ _long_, 8–10µ broad _Peck_, Rep. 50.

Common in rich pastures, lawns, roadsides, etc. May to October.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

A neat little fungus often found in great plenty. Though small it is
nevertheless edible and must be written with its edible companions.

On the ground in rich earth, and on dung.

In the black-spored series Psathyrella is separated by the striate
pileus, not exceeding the gills, Anellaria by the ring and Coprinus by
the deliquescent gills.

Panæolus, in its entirety, has a precise looking membership. If the
gills were cut from cardboard and fixed by machinery, they could not be
more correct. Some of the species are among the earliest arrivals at
toadstool lawn parties, and some are the last to leave. Several are
culinary favorites, notably Panæolus solidipes. P. papilionaceus
possesses intoxicating properties. P. campanulatus is reported to be a
sedative.

The edible species are easily cooked and are exceptionally delicate and
well flavored.


=P. retiru´gis= Fr.—_rete_, a net; _ruga_, a wrinkle. =Pileus= about 1
in. across, at first almost globose, then hemispherical, subumbonate,
minutely mealy, opaque, moist, furnished with uniting raised ribs,
pinkish tan-color; margin with irregular fragments of the veil attached.
=Flesh= rather thick. =Gills= adnexed, ascending, 2 lines or more broad,
grayish-black. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, about 2 lines thick, equal,
pruinose, purplish flesh-color, hollow. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptic-fusiform, 11–13×7µ _Massee_.

On dung. Distinguished among the species of Panæolus by the raised ribs
on the pileus and its appendiculate margin. The pileus is sometimes
grayish. Closely resembling, superficially, Psathyra corrugis, which is,
however, distinguished by the violet-black gills.

=Spores= elliptical, shortly fusiform, 20µ _Q._; 16×11µ _W.G.S._

New York, _Peck_, 23d Rep. West Virginia, 1881–1885. Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, frequent on dung. June to frost. _McIlvaine._

P. retirugis is not a common species, and is a sparse grower, but is
frequently found. It is seldom that a mess can be had at one time. It is
an excellent species by itself and imparts a good flavor to others.


=P. fimi´cola= Fr.—_fimus_, dung; _cola_, to inhabit. =Pileus= ½-¾ in.
across and high, slightly fleshy, convex bell-shaped, obtuse, glabrous,
opaque, dingy-gray when moist, paler and yellowish when dry, with a
narrow brown encircling zone near the margin. =Gills= adnate, 2 lines or
more broad, gray, variegated with smoky-black. =Stem= 2–4 in. high, 1
line or more thick, equal, fragile, whitish, powdered with white meal
upward, hollow. _Fries._

=Stem= soft, fragile, obsoletely silky-striatulate, 2–4 in. long.
=Pileus= when moist commonly smoky-gray, when dry grayish clay-color,
sometimes discoid. =Gills= semi-ovate with a minute decurrent tooth.
_Fries._

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. Frequent. On dung and richly
manured places. June to September. _McIlvaine._

P. fimicola is neither as large nor heavy as P. solidipes, but in other
respects equals it.


=P. soli´dipes= Pk.—_solidus_, solid; _pes_, a foot. (Plate CII, fig. 3,
4, p. 372.) =Pileus= 2–3 in. across, firm, at first hemispherical, then
sub-campanulate or convex, smooth, whitish, the cuticle at length
breaking up into dingy-yellowish, rather large, angular scales. =Gills=
broad, slightly attached, whitish, becoming black. =Stem= 2–4 lines
thick, firm, smooth, white, solid, slightly striate at the top. =Spores=
very black with a bluish tint. Height of plant 5–8 in. Dung heaps. West
Albany. June.

A large species, remarkable for its solid stem. The scales on the pileus
are larger on the disk, becoming smaller toward the margin. The upper
part of the stipe is sometimes beaded with drops of moisture. _Peck_,
23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, 1881–1885. Pennsylvania, New Jersey, frequent on dung and
dung heaps. May to frost. _McIlvaine._

On mature plants, or after rains, the scales are not always present.

P. solidipes is a handsome, readily recognized species of good weight
and substance. It is one of the best of toadstools.


=P. campanula´tus= Linn.—_campanula_, a little bell. =Pileus= oval,
bell-shaped or obtusely conical, sometimes umbonate, smooth, somewhat
shining, brownish, with a peculiar gray or lead-colored tint, sometimes
becoming reddish-tinted, the margin, often scalloped or fringed with the
appendiculate veil. =Lamellæ= not broad, attached, becoming
grayish-black. =Stem= long, slender, hollow, reddish, pruinose and
slightly striate at the top, at length dusted with the spores.

=Height= 4–6 in., breadth of pileus 6–12 lines.

On horse dung and rich soil. June and July. Common.

In very wet weather the cuticle of the pileus sometimes cracks into
scales or areas. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= subellipsoid, 16–18×10–13µ _K._; 8–9×6µ _Massee_.

Mr. R.K. Macadam, Boston, Mass., informs me that he has information of a
case of poisoning by this fungus. “The victim experienced dizziness,
dimness of vision, trembling and loss of power and memory. He recovered
after simple treatment and was well inside of 24 hours.”

A full account of this case is in “The London Medical and Surgical
Journal,” Vol. 36, November, 1816. The poison acts as a sedative.

I have several times eaten of this fungus in small quantities, because
larger could not be obtained, and with no other than pleasant effect.
There does not appear to be any case of poisoning reported by it since
1816, which, considering the inquisitiveness of man, is singular.
Caution is advised.


=P. papiliona´ceus= Fr.—_papilio_, a butterfly. =Pileus=
subhemispherical, sometimes subumbonate, smooth, or with the cuticle
breaking up into scales, whitish-gray, often tinged with yellow.
=Lamellæ= very broad, attached, becoming black. =Stem= slender, firm,
hollow, pruinose above, whitish, sometimes tinged with red or yellow,
slightly striate at the top and generally stained by the spores.

=Height= 3–5 in., breadth of pileus 6–18 lines.

On dung and rich soil. Common. May and June.

A small form occurs with the pileus nearly white, scarcely half an inch
in diameter, and the cuticle not cracking. _Peck_, 23d Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

The effects of P. papilionaceus are very uncertain. I have seen it
produce hilarity in a few instances, and other mild symptoms of
intoxication, which were soon over, and with little reaction. But I have
seen, at table, the same effects from eating preserved peaches and
preserved plums which had fermented. Many personal testings have been
without effect. Testings upon others vary with the individuals. The
fungus seems to contain a mild stimulant. It is not dangerous, but
should be eaten with caution. Being of small size, and not a prolific
species, quantities of it are difficult to obtain. Moderate quantities
of it have no effect whatever.

                          =ANELLA´RIA= Karst.

                       _Anellus_, a little ring.


=Pileus= slightly fleshy, smooth and even. =Gills= adnexed, dark
slate-color, variegated with the black spores. =Stem= central, smooth,
shining, rather firm. =Ring= present at first, either persistent or
forming a zone around the stem.

The species of this genus were formerly included in Panæolus, from which
this is separated by the presence of a ring, more or less definite.

In other characters they are similar. As in Amanitopsis and Amanita.


(Plate CIX.)

[Illustration:

  ANELLARIA SEPARATA.
  Natural size.
]

=A. separa´ta= Karst.—_separatus_, distinct, separate. =Pileus= 1–1½ in.
across, height about the same, ovate, then bell-shaped, not expanding,
viscid, even, ochraceous, then whitish, shining, wrinkled when old.
=Flesh= rather thick. =Gills= adfixed, ascending, thin, crowded, broad,
2–3 lines, grayish-black, margin paler. =Stem= long, 3–5 in., straight,
base thickened, attenuated upward, whitish, shining, top somewhat
striate. =Ring= persistent, distant. _Massee._

On dung. Rather variable in size.

=Pileus= bell-shaped, but very obtuse at the summit, ½-1¼ in. from the
base to the apex, not expanding at the base without cracking.

=Spores= broadly elliptic-fusiform, black, opaque, 10×7µ _Massee_;
ellipsoid, 16–22×10–12µ _K._; 16×11µ _W.G.S._

West Virginia, 1881–1885. New Jersey, Mt. Gretna, Pa., July, 1898, on
dung. _McIlvaine._

A common, frequent species from May to October. It is substantial in
flesh, excellent in substance and flavor. Cook soon and not over fifteen
minutes.




                            =PSATHYREL´LA.=

                             _Gr_—fragile.


=Pileus= membranaceous, _striate_, margin straight, at first pressed to
the stem, _not extending beyond the gills_. =Veil= inconspicuous.
=Gills= sooty-black, _not variegated_. =Spores= black.

Closely resembling Psathyra in appearance, but separated by the spore
color.

In the black-spored series Panæolus and Anellaria are distinguished by
their pilei not being striate and Coprinus by its deliquescent gills.

The species are small and can seldom be gathered in quantity. But those
tested have the full mushroom flavor and are valued for the flavor they
give to less gifted species when cooked with them.


=P. gra´cilis= Fr.—slender. =Pileus= ½-1 in. broad, _sooty_, livid,
etc., when dry, tan, rosy or whitish, hygrophanous, membranaceous,
bell-shaped, obtuse, smooth, _even_, slightly and pellucidly-striate
only round the margin. =Stem= 3 in. and more long, scarcely 1 line
thick, tubular, _remarkably tense and straight_, equal, naked, smooth,
whitish, _not rooted, white-villous at the base_. =Gills= wholly adnate,
commonly _broader_ behind (rarely linear), almost _distant_, distinct,
at first whitish, then cinereous-blackish with the black spores, _edge
rose-colored_. _Fries._

When dry the pileus is soft to the touch. Gregarious, fragile. Very
similar to A. corrugis, and there is a variety corrugated. _Stevenson._

=Spores= ellipsoid, 13–14×7–8µ _K._; 5×12µ _W.G.S._; 7×3–3.5µ _Massee_;
14×8µ _Morgan_.

New York, _Peck_, Rep. 23; West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
common, rich ground, June to October. _McIlvaine._

A common and beautiful fungus, growing in patches on rich ground. It is
decidedly prim. Its conical cap is regular as an extinguisher. It pays
to gather it for flavoring other species. I have not seen the corrugated
form mentioned by Fries. P. graciloides Pk. lacks the rosy-edged gills;
gills are whitish.


(Plate CX.)

[Illustration: PSATHYRELLA GRACILOIDES.]

=P. graciloi´des= Pk.—slender. =Pileus= thin, conical or bell-shaped,
glabrous, hygrophanous, brown and striatulate when moist, whitish and
subrugulose when dry. =Lamellæ= ascending, rather broad, subdistant,
brown, becoming blackish-brown, the edge whitish. =Stem= long, straight,
fragile, hollow, smooth, white. =Spores= blackish, elliptical,
15–16.5×8–8.5µ.

=Plant= gregarious, 4–6 in. high. =Pileus= 1 in. broad. =Stem= 1 line
thick.

Ground in an old dooryard. Maryland. September.

This is allied to A. gracilis Fr., but the edge of the gills is not
rosy. When drying the moisture leaves the disk of the pileus first, the
margin last. When dry the plant bears some resemblance to large forms of
A. tener. Under a lens the texture of the surface of the pileus is seen
to be composed of matted fibrils. _Peck_, 30th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Pennsylvania and New Jersey, on ground about houses and stables, often
in barn yards, after they have been cleaned out and are empty for the
summer. _McIlvaine._

The whitish-edged gills with entire absence of rosiness on gill edges
distinguish this species from P. gracilis Fr. It is frequent but not
plentiful. Often a pint can be gathered. It has a fine mushroom flavor,
resembling the delicate forms of Coprinus.


=P. atoma´ta= Fr.—_atomatus_, atomate. =Pileus= ½-1 in. broad, livid,
when dry becoming pale tan or pale flesh-color, sometimes reddish,
hygrophanous, membranaceous, bell-shaped, obtuse, _slightly striate_,
when dry without striæ, slightly wrinkled, _sprinkled with shining
atoms_. =Stem= 2 in. long, almost 1 line thick, tubular, equal, not
rooted, _lax_, slightly bent (not tense and straight), _white and white
pulverulent at the apex_. =Gills= adnate, broad, _ventricose, slightly
distinct_, whitish, but cinereous-blackish with the black spores.
_Fries._

Solitary or gregarious. Pileus changing like A. gracilis from livid to
whitish and rose-color, but more fragile. _Stevenson._

=Spores= elliptical, 10×4µ _Massee_; 14×9µ _W.G.S_.; 11×8µ _Morgan_.

Chester county, Pa., June to September. _McIlvaine._

Several specimens were eaten. In flavor they could not be distinguished
from C. micaceus. The scarcity and small size of the species make it of
little value, save as a flavoring.


(Plate CXI.)

[Illustration: PSATHYRELLA DISSEMINATA.]

=P. dissemina´ta= Pers.—_dissemino_, to scatter. Found everywhere.
Densely tufted. =Pileus= about ½ in. across, membranaceous, ovate,
bell-shaped, at first scurfy, then naked, coarsely striate, margin
entire, yellowish then gray. =Gills= adnate, narrow, whitish, then gray,
finally blackish. =Stem= 1–1½ in. long, rather curved, mealy then
smooth, fragile, hollow. _Massee._

Crowded. =Pileus= ovate, conical, at length bell-shaped, ⅓-½ in. from
the base to the apex, striate and plicate, membranaceous, pale buff or
reddish-brown, at length gray, becoming flaccid and dissolving. =Gills=
distant, narrow, pale brown. =Stipes= 1–3 in. long, slender, weak,
brittle, crooked, hollow, pale yellowish, whitish or grayish.
Particularly partial to old willow trees, and when growing on a stump of
a felled tree often covering nearly a square yard. _Grev._

=Spores= 8×6µ _W.G.S_.; 7.6×5µ _Morgan._

West Virginia, New Jersey, Mt. Gretna, Pa., about abandoned camp.
Densely tufted. May to frost. _McIlvaine._

Patches of it are very common on old trunks, about decaying trees, on
ground. The caps rarely reach 1 in. in diameter. The plants cook away to
almost nothing, but they are of fine flavor, which they impart to the
cooking medium.

                           =GOMPHI´DIUS= Fr.

                         A wooden bolt or nail.


=Hymenophore= decurrent. =Gills= distant, composed of a mucilaginous
membrane, which can be readily separated into two plates, continuous at
the edge which is acute and powdered with the blackish fusiform spores.
=Veil= viscoso-floccose. Fleshy, putrescent, pileus at length the shape
of an inverted cone.

A small genus with great difference among the species. Intermediate in
habit between Cortinarius and Hygrophorus.

Universal =Veil= glutinous, at first terminating on the stem in a
floccose ring soon disappearing. The =Gills= frequently admit of being
detached and stretched out into a continuous membrane. _Fries._

A genus possessing several well-marked characters. The very decurrent
gills differ from all others in their soft mucilaginous consistency. The
spores are larger than usual in the Agaricaceæ and have the elongated
spindle-shape found in Boleti. The stem and pileus are of the same
substance, and the pileus and veil are both glutinous when moist. The
spores have been described as greenish-gray becoming black, and as
dingy-olive.

I have had opportunity to see but two species of this small genus—G.
rhodoxanthus and G. viscidus. Of these the spores are decidedly
olivaceous. If the six other species recorded as found in the United
States are as creditable, they are well worth hunting for. G.
Oregonensis Pk. is reported as edible and as a valuable food species in
Oregon. The glutinous coatings to pileus and stem do not appear on the
American form of G. rhodoxanthus in the localities I have found it in
during fifteen years.


=G. glutino´sus= (Schaeff.) Fr.—_glutin_, glue. =Pileus= 2–5 in. broad,
purple-brown, often mottled with black spots, fleshy, convex, obtuse, at
length plane, even depressed, even, smooth, very glutinous. =Flesh=
thick, about ½ in., soft, white. =Stem= 2–3 in. and more long, about ½
in. thick, solid, whitish, thickened and externally and internally
yellow at the base, viscid with the veil, fibrillose or varying with
black scales. =Cortina= often woven in the form of a ring, but soon
fugacious. =Gills= deeply decurrent, distant, distinct, branched, quite
entire, mucilaginous, 3–4 lines broad, _at first whitish, then
cinereous_, clouded with the spores.

Trama none, wherefore the gills easily separate from the pileus. Taste
watery, moldy. Odor not marked. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 20µ _Cooke_; 18–23×6–8µ _K._; 16–17×6µ _W.G.S._; 18–20×6µ
_Massee_.

Distinguished by the bright yellow base of stem.

Pine woods. July to November. Nova Scotia. _Somers._

Edible. _Leuba._ Chiefly used for catsup. _Cooke._

Var. _ro´seus_. =Pileus= rose-color. =Stem= white, attenuated and rosy
flesh-color internally at the base. Very distinguished, always smaller.

=Spores= 20–22×6µ _K._

Nova Scotia. Massachusetts. _Frost._

I have not seen this species or its variety. Eminent authorities vouch
for its edibility.


=G. Oregonen´sis= Pk. =Pileus= at first convex, becoming nearly plane or
somewhat centrally depressed, viscid, brown or dark-brown, becoming
black in drying, taste sweet and pleasant. =Lamellæ= numerous, rather
close, adnate or slightly decurrent, blackish in the dried plant. =Stem=
short, solid, equal or slightly tapering upward, colored like the
pileus. =Spores= oblong, 10–12.5µ long, 4–5µ broad.

=Pileus= 5–10 cm. broad. =Stem= 2.5–5 cm. long, 4–10 mm. thick.

Fir woods. Oregon. September to December. _Lane._

Dr. Lane writes that this species is edible and grows so abundantly in
fir woods that it might be gathered by wagon loads and might be made a
source of an abundant food supply. _Peck_. Torrey Bulletin, Vol. 25, No.
6, June, 1898.


(Plate CXII.)

[Illustration:

  GOMPHIDIUS VISCIDUS.
  One-half natural size.
]

=G. vis´cidus= Fr.—viscid. =Pileus= 2–3 in. and more broad,
brownish-red, compact, at first bell-shaped, then expanded, umbonate,
slightly viscous, shining when dry. =Flesh= yellowish. =Stem= 3–4 in.
and more long, ½ in. thick, solid, equal or attenuated at the base which
is rhubarb-colored internally, scaly-fibrillose, not very viscous,
yellowish. =Cortina= very evidently floccose, not glutinous, woven in
the form of a ring, but readily falling off. =Gills= deeply decurrent,
distant, the shorter ones adnexed to the longer, not truly branched, at
first paler, somewhat olive, at length brownish-purple, clouded with the
spores. _Fries._

Hymenophore descending between the gill plates. Odor not unpleasant.
_Stevenson._

Chiefly used in catsup. _Cooke._ Edible. _Leuba._ _Cooke._

North Carolina, Massachusetts, _Frost_. Minnesota, California,
Pennsylvania.

Many grew under pines at Mt. Gretna, Pa., September to November. The
gills seemed branched, but were grown together. Taste and smell
pleasant. The caps are good, but not equal to G. rhodoxanthus.


=G. rhodoxan´thus= Schw. (Plate XCVII, fig. 4, 5, p. 352.) Solitary.
=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad, cushion-shaped, reddish-yellow, sometimes with
dusky hues. =Gills= arched, decurrent, orange-yellow. =Stem= attenuated,
short, firm.

=Spores= oblong, 10–12.5µ in length. _Peck._ Olivaceous. _McIlvaine._

Solitary, gregarious or cespitose.

Among leaves and grass in shady places. August to October.

When the student has mastered the name and memorized the description,
Gomphidius rhodoxanthus can not be mistaken for any other species.

It is not common in localities I have frequented, but its presence is
pretty general in the United States, specimens having been sent to me
from Georgia, Iowa, New York, New Jersey, etc., and I have found it in
West Virginia, North Carolina, Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia, and
other places in Pennsylvania, from July to September, 1898, inclusive.
Having enjoyed it in West Virginia in 1882, I was delighted to find it
in generous quantity at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and to eat many meals of it.
Its caps are not excelled by any edible fungus. They have solid,
delicious substance and rich full flavor.

The plant is often cespitose. I have never found its cap viscid or
glutinous. The cooked flesh has the latter consistency.

[Illustration]




                           =MONTAGNITES= Fr.

              After Montagne. (Plate CI, fig. 6, p. 368.)


The universal veil forming a volva, persistent. =Stem= dilated at the
apex into a plane round disk, even on both sides, _to the margin_ of
which are _adfixed the gills which are free, not joined by any
membrane_, radiating, razor-shaped, persistent, obtuse at the edge.
=Trama= cellulose. =Spores= oblong, even, black fuscous. _Fries._

A single species is reported from Texas.




                       FAMILY II.—=POLYPORACEÆ.=


Hymenophore inferior, facing the ground. Hymenium consisting of tubes
with poriform mouths which are round or angular, sometimes sinuous or
torn, lined with 4-spored sporophores and cystidia.

Fleshy, coriaceous or woody fungi, most abundant and luxuriant in warm
countries. Intermediate between the Agaricaceæ and the Hydnaceæ,
connected with the former by Dædalea and Lenzites, and with the latter
by Fistulina and Irpex. _Fries._

Within this large family are famed edible species, notably in Boletinus,
Boletus and Fistulina. In the woody species the razor-strop man finds
material for his strops (Polyporus celulinus); the surgeon styptics; the
peasant punk to catch sparks from his flint, and the 4th of July urchin
a fire-holder to light his pyrotechnics. The Chinese have placed some
species in their fathomless materia medica, while the Polyporus of the
locust tree is used in America as a medicine for horses. No fungoid
growth is more universal. They are the ever active pruners of our trees
and converters of forest debris. They begin the task in Nature’s
laboratory of changing decaying wood into assimilable shape as food to
feed the very trees that dropped it. Some are of annual growth, others
add to their substance year after year, often attaining enormous size.
In summer and in winter they are ever present objects for interesting
study.

stratose; fleshy and tough, stipitate or sessile.

                                 FOMES.

Tubes as in Polyporus, often stratose; woody, sessile; dimidiate. (No
edible species reported.)

                              POLYSTICTUS.

                             MUCRONOPORUS.

Tubes studded with reddish-brown spines, intermingled with the basidia,
otherwise as in Polystictus (and also as in Polyporus and Fomes).
_Atkinson._ (No edible species reported.)

                               TRAMETES.

Tubes immersed in flesh of pileus, of various depths, hence not forming
a heterogeneous stratum, subcylindrical, not stratose; corky; sessile.

                                DÆDALEA.

                          =BOLETI´NUS= Kalchb.

                         (Plate CXIII, p. 402.)


=Hymenophore= not even (as in Boletus), but extended in blunt points
descending like a trama among the tubes. =Tubes= not easily separable
from the hymenophore and from each other. =Stem= ringed, hollow.
=Spores= pale yellowish. Sylloge, Vol. VI, p. 51.

Professor Peck has for excellent reasons, given in his Boleti of the
United States, emended the generic diagnosis of Fries thus: _Hymenium
composed of broader radiating lamellæ connected by very numerous more
narrow anastomosing branches or partitions and forming large angular
pores. Tubes somewhat tenacious, not easily separable from the
hymenophore and from each other, adnate or subdecurrent, yellowish._

Professor Peck classifies Boletinus as follows:

        Stem hollow                                       B. cavipes

    Boleti of the United States, p. 76.

There are six species given as found in the United States—B. cavipes
Kalchb., B. pictus Pk., B. paluster Pk., B. decipiens Pk., B. porosus
Pk., B. appendiculatus Pk.—of these I have found and eaten four. B.
decipiens has, at this writing, not been seen by Professor Peck, but
Professor Farlow, of Harvard, has informed him of authentic specimens.
There is every probability of its being as edible as the others; a
description of it is, therefore, given.

In consistency Boletinus is of the best, being rather like that of
marshmallows, and the same as Boletus subaureus. The flavor is mild and
pleasant.

Professor Peck mentions that the smell of B. porosus is sometimes
unpleasant. I have been fortunate in not having had this experience.


=B. ca´vipes= Kalchb. =Pileus= broadly convex, rather tough, flexible,
soft, subumbonate, fibrillose-scaly, tawny-brown, sometimes tinged with
reddish or purplish. =Flesh= yellowish. =Tubes= slightly decurrent, at
first pale-yellow, then darker and tinged with green, becoming
dingy-ochraceous with age. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward,
somewhat fibrillose or floccose, slightly ringed, _hollow_, tawny-brown
or yellowish-brown, yellowish at the top and marked by the decurrent
dissepiments of the tubes, white within. =Veil= whitish, partly adhering
to the margin of the pileus, soon disappearing. =Spores= 8–10×4µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 3–6 lines thick. Swamps
and damp mossy ground under or near tamarack trees. New York, _Peck_;
New England, _Frost_.

The pileus is clothed with a fibrillose tomentum which becomes more or
less united into floccose tufts or scales. The umbo is not always
present and is generally small. The young stem may sometimes be stuffed,
but, if so, it soon becomes hollow, though the cavity is irregular. The
freshly shed spores have a greenish-yellow or olivaceous hue, but in
time they assume a pale or yellowish-ochraceous hue. This species is
apparently northern in its range. It loves cold sphagnous swamps in
mountainous regions. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia mountains under spruce trees. Haddonfield, N.J., among
scrub pines. Mt. Gretna, Pa., among pines.

It is of excellent consistency and of mild pleasant flavor. It is at its
best in patties, croquettes and escallops.


=B. appendicula´tus= Pk. =Pileus= fleshy, convex, glabrous,
ochraceous-yellow, the margin appendiculate with an incurved membranous
veil. =Flesh= pale-yellow, unchangeable. =Tubes= rather small, yellow,
their mouths angular, unequal, becoming darker or brownish where
wounded. =Stem= solid, slightly thickened at the base, yellow. =Spores=
pale-yellow, oblong, 10–12×4µ. =Pileus= 4–8 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in.
long, 4–6 lines thick.

=B. pic´tus= Pk. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane, at first covered with
a _red fibrillose tomentum which soon divides into small scales
revealing the yellow color of the pileus beneath_. =Flesh= yellow, often
slowly changing to dull pinkish or reddish tints where wounded. =Tubes=
tenacious, at first pale yellow, becoming darker or dingy ochraceous
with age, sometimes changing to pinkish-brown where bruised, concealed
in the young plant by the copious whitish webby veil. =Stem= equal or
nearly so, solid, _slightly_ and somewhat evanescently annulate, clothed
and colored like or a little paler than the pileus, yellowish at the
top. =Spores= ochraceous, 9–11×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Woods and mossy swamps. New York, _Peck_; New England, _Frost_; North

West Virginia mountains, 1882. Haddonfield, N.J., Angora, West
Philadelphia, Mt. Gretna, Pa. August and September. In mixed woods,
principally oak. Leominster, Mass. _C.F. Nixon_, Ph. G.

It is sometimes found upon much decayed chestnut stumps.

The caps of some species are so cracked as to appear distinctly
areolate. The white webby veil is often persistent. The fungus is one of
the handsomest. Its rich variegated colors impress it upon eye-memory.
It is one of the very best edible species.

ochraceous or dingy ochraceous. =Stem= slender, solid, subglabrous, red,
yellowish at the top. =Spores= pinkish-brown, 8–9×4µ.

A few specimens found at Mt. Gretna had stems slightly reticulated. Its
taste is sweet, smell mild, and cooked it is of excellent body and
flavor.


=B. deci´piens= (B. and C.) Pk. =Pileus= dry, minutely silky,
_whitish-yellow or pale-buff_, flesh buff, one-third in. thick;
hymenium plane or somewhat concave, yellow, consisting of large,
unequal, flexuous radiating tubes resembling multiseptate lamellæ.
=Stem= equal, solid but spongy. Veil floccose, evanescent, adhering
for a time to the margin of the pileus. =Spores= rather minute,
oblong, _ochraceo-ferruginous_ (rusty yellow), 8–10×3.5–4µ.

=Pileus= 2 in. broad. Stem 2–2.5 in. long, 3–4 lines thick.

Thin woods. North and South Carolina. _M.A. Curtis._

Specimens of this species have not been seen by me. The authors remark
that its affinities are clearly with Boletinus flavidus and its allies,
from which it is distinguished by its large radiating pores. They also
say that when dry it is scarcely distinguishable from Paxillus porosus
Berk., except by its spores. This would imply that its stem is eccentric
or lateral, and I have been informed by Mr. Ravenel that it is sometimes
so. But specimens of this kind, labeled Boletinus decipiens B. and C.,
have been received, which show by their spores that they are Paxillus
porosus. Besides, Professor Farlow informs me that authentic specimens
of B. decipiens in the Curtisian Herbarium have only central stems, from
which things I suspect that the two species have been confused. The
spore dimensions here given are derived from a specimen in the Curtis
Herbarium, through the kindness of Professor Farlow. _Peck_, Boleti of
the U.S.

I have not recognized this Boletinus. Its affinities are with excellent
edible species.

=B. poro´sus= (Berk.) Pk. (Plate CXIII.) =Pileus= fleshy, viscid when
moist, shining, reddish-brown. =Flesh= 3–9 lines thick, the margin thin
and even; hymenium porous, yellow, formed by radiating lamellæ a line to
half a line distant, branching and connected by numerous irregular veins
of less prominence and forming large angular pores. =Stem= lateral,
tough, diffused into the pileus, reticulated at the top by the decurrent
walls of the tubes, colored like the pileus. =Spores= semi-ovate.

=Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 6–16 lines long, 4–6 lines thick.

Var. _opa´cus_ (Paxillus porosus Berk., Bull. N.Y. State Mus. 2, p. 32).
=Pileus= dry, glabrous or subtomentose, not shining, brown or

Damp ground in woods and open places. Ohio, _Lea_, _Morgan_; North
Carolina, _Curtis_; New England, _Frost_, _Farlow_; Wisconsin, _Bundy_;
New York, _Peck_.

This species is remarkable for its lateral or eccentric stem. There is
often an emargination in the pileus on the side of the stem which gives
it a kidney shape. In the typical form it is described as viscid when
moist, and the Wisconsin plant is also described as viscid, but in all
the New York specimens that I have seen it is dry and sometimes minutely
tomentose. I have, therefore, separated these as a variety. The color of
the pileus varies from yellowish-brown to reddish-brown or umber. A
disagreeable odor is sometimes present. The tubes are rather short and
tough and do not easily separate from the hymenophore and from each
other. In the young plant they are not separable. They sometimes become
slightly blue where wounded. As in other species they are pale yellow
when young, but become darker or dingy-ochraceous with age. The spores
have been described as bright yellow, but I do not find them so in the
New York plant. The plant is incongruous among the Paxilli by reason of
its wholly porous hymenium, but in this place it seems to be among its
true allies. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Fine specimens were sent to me by Mr. H.I. Miller, Terre Haute, and Dr.
J.R. Weist, Richmond, Ind. They were in condition to be eaten and
enjoyed. No disagreeable odor was perceptible.


=B. borea´lis= Pk. =Pileus= fleshy, convex, obtuse or subumbonate,
brownish-yellow, obscurely and somewhat reticulately streaked with
reddish-brown lines. =Pores= large, angular, unequal, slightly
decurrent, brownish-yellow. =Stem= short, equal or slightly tapering
upward, brownish-yellow with a whitish myceloid tomentum at the base.
=Spores= oblong, 10–12.5×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= about 1 in. long.

Sandy soil. Capstan Island, Labrador. October. _Waghorne._

The markings of the pileus appear as if due to the drying of a glutinous
substance. The radiating lamellæ and the transverse partitions of the
interspaces are very plainly shown. Described from two dried specimens.

                            =BOLE´TUS= Dill.

                              _Gr_—a clod.


The name of a fungus considered a great delicacy among the Romans,
derived from _bolos_, a clod, probably to denote the round figure of the
plant.

=Hymenium= wholly composed of small tubes, connected together in a
stratum, the surface of which is dotted with their poriform mouths, and
which is distinct from the hymenophore on account of the latter not
descending into a trama. =Tubes= packed close together, easily
separating from the hymenophore and from one another. =Pores= or mouths
of the tubes round or angular (in the subgenus Gyrodon sinuous or
gyroso-plicate). =Spores= normally fusiform, rarely oval or somewhat
round. _Growing on the ground, fleshy, putrescent, with central stems.
Mostly edible, and of importance as articles of food; a few poisonous._
_Fries._

No American species in Gyrodon. It is therefore omitted in synopsis of
tribes. _C.M._

This genus abounds in species and is related to Boletinus on one hand
and to Polyporus on the other. From the latter it is distinguished by
the absence of a trama and from both by the tubes being easily separable
from the hymenophore and from each other. Some of the species are very
variable, others are so closely allied that they appear to almost run
together.

The species are generally terrestrial, but B. hemichrysus is habitually
wood-growing, and others are occasionally so.

The spores vary so much in color in such closely related species that
this character is scarcely available for general classification, but it
is valuable as a specific character and should always be noted.

      _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

C.H. Peck, N.Y. State Botanist, has contributed to Mycological
literature his careful arrangement and analysis of species of this
genus, in his “Boleti of the United States.” Species of the genus are
found in every state of the Union. Several species are common to all the
states. Comprehending, as do the states, all sorts of climates within
their vast range of latitude, differences in appearance and structure in
the same species must be expected, dependent largely, as they are in
most fungi, upon habitat and environment. These variations will
frequently suggest new species. Descriptions which are typical and which
can be recognized as standard are most desirable. Professor Peck’s are
accepted by the writer as such, that there may be uniformity, and are
quoted as fully as space will permit. Such variations as are
attributable to locality will be noted.

Since 1882 the writer has given great attention to the edible qualities
of the Boleti. He is convinced by many personal tests and those made by
his family and friends, that much, if not all, of the suspicion thrown
about Boleti is unjust and erroneous. He is able to state positively
that change of color when bruised or broken; bitter and pepperiness have
nothing whatever to do with the edible qualities of species exhibiting
them, excepting in B. felleus, which exhibits an intense bitter, not
lost in cooking. It is not poisonous.

The writer has the courage of his convictions, and has taken interest in
eating species with a bad reputation whenever opportunity afforded, that
their just dues might be given them. He has never experienced the
slightest inconvenience. But others may not be so fortunate.

Before cooking Boleti the stem, unless crisp and tender, should be
removed, as should the tubes unless young and fresh. They broil, fry,
stew, make good soups and dry well. See recipes.

It is believed that all species of Boleti up to this time found in
America are described in this volume. When no remarks of the writer
follow the descriptions, he has not had an opportunity to test the
edible quality of the species.

]

=B. specta´bilis= Pk.—_spectabilis_, distinguished. =Pileus= broadly
convex, _at first covered with a red tomentum, then scaly_, viscid when
moist, _red_, the tomentose scales becoming grayish-red, brownish or
yellowish. =Flesh= whitish or pale-yellow. =Tubes= at first yellow and
concealed by a reddish glutinous membrane, then ochraceous, convex,
_large, angular, adnate_. =Stem= nearly equal, annulate, yellow above
the annulus, red or red with yellow stains below. =Spores=
_purplish-brown_, 13–15×6–7µ.

=Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Thin woods in swamps. New York, _Peck_; Wisconsin, _Bundy_.

This is a rare and showy species which inhabits the cold northern swamps
of the country. It probably extends into Canada. When cut, the flesh
emits a strong, unpleasant odor. Wounds of the flesh made by insects or
other small animals have a bright-yellow color. When young, the
tomentose veil covers the whole plant, but it soon parts into scales on
the pileus and partly or wholly disappears from the stem. _Peck_, Boleti
of the U.S.

London, Can., _J. Dearness_; _Peck_, Rep. 44, N.Y. State Bot.


=B. Elben´sis= Pk. =Pileus= convex, glabrous, viscid when moist, dingy
gray or pinkish-gray inclining to brownish, obscurely spotted or
streaked as if with patches of innate fibrils. =Flesh= white. =Tubes= at
first whitish, becoming dingy or brownish-ochraceous, nearly plane,
adnate or slightly decurrent, rather large, angular. =Stem= nearly
equal, annulate, _whitish above the ring_, colored like the pileus
below, sometimes slightly reticulated at the top. =Spores=
_ferruginous_-brown, 10–12×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, 4–6 lines thick. Thin woods
of tamarack, spruce and balsam. New York. _Peck._

Its locality is thus far limited to the Adirondack region of this state.
_Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. sero´tinus= Frost.—late. Bulletin Buffalo Soc. Nat. Sci., 1874.
=Pileus= flat or convex, viscid, sordid brown, streaked with the
remnants of the veil, especially near the margin, which is white, very
thin, and when partly grown singularly pendent. =Flesh= white, _changing
to bluish_. =Tubes= large, angular, unequal, slightly decurrent, at
first sordid white or gray, sometimes tinged with green near the stem,
afterward cinnamon-yellow. =Stem= reticulated above the ring which
adheres partly to it and partly to the margin of the pileus, white but
stained by the brownish spores and tinged with yellow at maturity.
=Spores= 10×6µ.

Shaded grassy ground. New England, _Frost_.

Probably this is only a variety of the preceding species. _Peck_, Boleti
of the U.S.


=B. salmoni´color= Frost. Bull. Buff. Soc. Nat. Sci., 1874. =Pileus=
convex, soft, very glutinous, brownish or tawny-white with a faint tinge
of red, wine-color when dry, the margin thin. =Flesh= _tinged with red_.
=Tubes= simple, even, angular, adnate, _pale salmon_ color. =Stem=
small, dotted above with bright ferruginous red, sordid below, annulus
_dingy salmon-color_. =Spores= 8×2.5µ.

Borders of pine woods. New England. _Frost._

Apparently a distinct species. No specimens seen. _Peck_, Boleti of the
U.S.


=B. el´egans= Schum. =Pileus= convex or plane, viscose, _golden-yellow
or somewhat rust-color_. =Flesh= pale-yellow. =Tubes= decurrent, golden
or sulphur-yellow, the mouths minute, simple. =Stem= unequal, firm,
golden or reddish, _dotted above the fugacious white or pale-yellowish
annulus_.

=Pileus= 3–4.5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long.

Woods, especially under or near larch trees. North Carolina, _Curtis_;
Wisconsin, _Bundy_; Minnesota, _Johnson_. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Cordier and Gillet give the species as edible though not delicate.

West Philadelphia on lawns under larches, 1887–1891. _McIlvaine._

The caps are of good flavor and consistency. They are best fried or
broiled.


=B. Clin´tonianus= Pk. =Pileus= convex, very viscid or glutinous,
glabrous, soft, shining, _golden-yellow, reddish yellow or chestnut
color_, the margin thin. =Flesh= pale yellow, becoming less bright or
dingy on exposure to the air. =Tubes= nearly plane, adnate or
subdecurrent, _small_, angular or subrotund, pale-yellow, becoming
dingy-ochraceous with age, _changing to brown or purplish-brown where
bruised_. =Stem= equal or slightly thickened toward the base, straight
or flexuous, _yellow at the top_, reddish or reddish-brown below the
annulus, sometimes varied with yellow stains, the annulus white or
yellow, _persistent_, forming a thick band about the stem. =Spores=
_brownish-ochraceous_, 10–11×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–5 in. long, 4–9 lines thick.

Mossy or grassy ground in woods or open places, especially under or near
tamarack trees. New York, _Peck_; New England, _Frost_.

This is apparently closely related to B. elegans, from which it differs
in its thick persistent ring, in its stem which is not at all dotted and
in its longer and darker-colored spores. Its smaller tubes and
persistent ring separate it also from B. flavus. In the typical form the
pileus is bay-red or chestnut color, but plants growing in open places
generally have it yellowish or reddish-yellow. It is mild to the taste
and I have eaten it sparingly. It sometimes grows in tufts. _Peck_,
Boleti of the U.S.


=B. inflex´us= Pk.—curving. =Pileus= convex, glabrous, viscid, yellow,
often red or reddish on the disk, the margin thin, inflexed, concealing
the marginal tubes. =Flesh= whitish, not changing color where wounded.
=Tubes= rather long, adnate, yellowish, becoming dingy-yellow with age,
the mouths small, dotted with reddish glandules. =Stem= rather slender,
not ringed, solid, viscid, dotted with livid-yellow glandules. =Spores=
yellowish, 10–12×4–5µ.

=Pileus= about 1 in. broad. =Stem= about 2 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Open woods. Trexlertown. September. _Herbst._

This Boletus belongs to the tribe Viscipelles. It is remarkable for and
easily recognized by the inflexed margin of the pileus, which imitates
to some extent the appendiculate veil of Boletus versipellis. It
sometimes grows in tufts. The paper in which fresh specimens were
wrapped was stained yellow. Boletus Braunii Bres. has an inflexed
margin, but that is a much larger plant with a yellowish-brown pileus, a
fibrillose stem and much smaller spores. _Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club,
Vol. 22, No. 5.


=B. fla´vus= With. =Pileus= convex, compact, covered with a brownish
separating gluten, _pale-yellow_. =Flesh= pale-yellow. =Tubes= large,
angular, adnate, yellow. =Stem= yellow, becoming brownish, reticulated
above the _membranous fugacious_ dirty yellowish annulus. =Spores=
8–10×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 6–10 lines thick.

Woods. Minnesota, _Johnson_; Wisconsin, _Bundy_.

This is apparently a rare species in this country. I have not seen it.
It is said to resemble B. luteus, from which it is separated by the
large angular mouths of the tubes. In British Fungi the spores are
described as “spindle-shaped, yellowish-brown;” in Sylloge, as
“ovoid-oblong, acute at the base, granulose, pale ochraceous.” _Peck_,
Boleti of the U.S.


=B. fistulo´sus= Pk. =Pileus= convex, viscid, glabrous, yellow, the
margin at first incurved or involute. =Flesh= yellow. =Tubes= plane or
subventricose, medium size, round with thin walls, adnate or sometimes
depressed around the stem, yellow. =Stem= rather slender, subequal,
viscid, glabrous, hollow, yellow, with a white mycelioid tomentum at the
base. =Spores= elliptical, 13×6µ.

=Pileus= about 1 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, about 3 lines thick.

Grassy woods. Auburn, Ala. July. _Underwood._

A small but pretty species of a yellow color throughout. It is
remarkable for its hollow stem, which is suggestive of the specific
name. It is referable to the tribe Viscipelles. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey
Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.


=B. sphæros´porus= Pk.—globose-spored. (Bulletin Torrey Botanical Club,
Vol. XII.) =Pileus= at first hemispherical, then convex, glabrous,
viscid, creamy-yellow, becoming reddish-brown or chestnut color with
age. =Flesh= pale yellowish-brown. =Tubes= adnate or slightly decurrent,
large, angular, pale-yellow, becoming brown, sometimes tinged with
green. =Stem= stout, equal, even or slightly reticulated at the top, the
_membranous annulus persistent_, sometimes partly adhering to the margin
of the pileus. =Spores= _globose or broadly elliptical_, 8–9µ long.

=Pileus= 3–8 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.

Low ravines and sandy places. Wisconsin, _Trelease_; Iowa, _McBride_.

The spores easily serve to distinguish this species from its allies. The
European B. sphærocephalus has ovoid spores, but its tube mouths are
minute and rotund and its stem is densely squamose. _Peck_, Boleti of
the U.S.


=B. lu´teus= L.—yellow. =Pileus= gibbous or convex, covered with a
brownish separating gluten, becoming yellowish-brown and
virgate-spotted. =Flesh= white. =Tubes= adnate, minute, simple, yellow,
becoming darker with age. =Stem= _stout_, yellowish and _dotted above_
the large membranous brownish-white annulus, brownish-white or yellowish
below. =Spores= fusiform, yellowish-brown, 6–7×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 6–10 lines thick.

Pine woods and groves. New York, _Peck_.

B. luteus has an international reputation for edibility. I have found it
at Waretown and Haddonfield, N.J.; in Bartram’s Garden, West
Philadelphia, always under pines. At Waretown it was gregarious. Pine
needles, sand, anything through which it grows, adheres to the glutinous
cap. It must be carefully cleaned before cooking. It is then of choice
consistency and good flavor.


(Plate CXV_a_.)

[Illustration: SECTION OF BOLETUS SUBLUTEUS.]

=B. sublu´teus= Pk.—luteus, yellow. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane,
viscid or glutinous when moist, often obscurely virgate-spotted,
dingy-yellowish, inclining to rusty-brown. =Flesh= whitish, varying to
dull-yellowish. =Tubes= plane or convex, adnate, small, subrotund,
yellow becoming ochraceous. =Stem= equal, _slender_, pallid or
yellowish, _dotted both above and below_ the ring with reddish or
brownish glandules; ring submembranous, _glutinous_, at first
concealing the tubes, then generally collapsing and forming a narrow
whitish or brownish band around the stem. =Spores= subfusiform,
ochraceo-ferruginous, 8–10×4–5µ. =Pileus= 1.5–3 in. broad. =Stem=
1.5–2.5 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Sandy soil in pine woods. New York, _Peck_, _Clinton_; New England,
_Frost_.

The species is closely related to B. luteus, from which it differs in
its smaller size, more slender stem and glutinous collapsing veil.
_Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Found at Waretown, N.J., 1887, under pines and in same locality as B.
luteus, for which it can be readily mistaken. It is usually covered with
adherent sand or pine needles. Its flesh is tender with a pleasant
glutinosity. Flavor good.


=B. fla´vidus= Fr.—light yellowish. =Pileus= thin, gibbous, then plane,
viscose, livid, yellowish. =Flesh= pallid. =Tubes= decurrent, with
_large angular compound mouths_, dirty yellowish. =Stem= _slender_,
subequal, pallid, sprinkled with _fugacious glandules above the entirely
viscose ring_. =Spores= oblong-ellipsoid, straight, subhyaline,
8–10×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 2–3 lines thick.

Pine woods and swamps. Pennsylvania, _Schweinitz_; North Carolina,
_Curtis_; New England, _Frost_; California, _H. and M._; Rhode Island,
_Bennett_.

Fries says that this species is more slender than its allies, and
differs from them all in its merely glutinous veil. _Peck_, Boleti of
the U.S.

Dr. Curtis, of North Carolina, places it among edible species.

Many specimens were found by the writer near Waretown and Haddonfield,
N.J., and a few at Mt. Gretna, Pa. The stems are thin and slightly
spreading at the top. They are hard. The caps are excellent.


=B. America´nus= Pk. =Pileus= thin, convex or nearly plane, sometimes
umbonate, soft, very viscid or glutinous when moist, _slightly tomentose
on the margin when young_, soon glabrous or the margin sometimes
remaining scaly, rarely scale-spotted from the drying of the gluten,
yellow, becoming dingy or less bright with age, sometimes vaguely dotted
or streaked with bright red. =Flesh= pale-yellow, less clear or
pinkish-gray on exposure to the air. =Tubes= plane or convex, adnate,
_rather large_, angular, pale-yellow, becoming sordid-ochraceous. =Stem=
_slender_, equal or slightly tapering upward, firm, _not at all
annulate_, yellow, often pallid or brownish toward the base, marked with
_numerous brown or reddish-brown persistent glandular dots_, yellow
within. =Spores= oblong or subfusiform, ochraceo-ferruginous, 9–11×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–2.5 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Woods, swamps and open places, especially under or near pine trees. New
York, _Peck_, _Clinton_; Minnesota, _Arthur_.

A slight subacid odor is sometimes perceptible in our plant. It
sometimes grows on much decayed wood. Its mycelium is white. _Peck_,
Boleti of the U.S.

The caps, only, are good.


=B. subau´reus= Pk.—_sub_ and _aureus_, golden. (Plate CXIV, fig. 2, p.
414.) =Pileus= convex or nearly plane, viscose, pale-yellow, sometimes
adorned with darker spots, the young margin slightly grayish-tomentose.
=Flesh= pale-yellow. =Tubes= _small or medium_; somewhat angular, adnate
or subdecurrent, pale-yellow becoming dingy-ochraceous. =Stem= equal,
_stout_, glandular-dotted, yellow _without and within_. =Spores= oblong
or subfusiform, ochraceo-ferruginous, 8–10×4µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–2.5 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Thin woods and open places. New York, _Peck_; North Carolina, _C.J.
Curtis_; Massachusetts, Mississippi, _G. Survey_ (Rep. 51).

This plant might almost be considered a stout variety of the preceding,
but in addition to its thicker pileus and stouter stem, it has smaller
tubes of a clearer yellow color, and the exuding drops are yellow, not
whitish, as in that species. In habit it appears more like B.
granulatus, from which it is distinct in color. _Peck_, Boleti of the
U.S.

From early October, through heavy frosts and until long after November
snows I found this species at Mt. Gretna, Pa., in 1897–1898. Specimens
were sent to Professor Peck and identified as this species. It grew in
grass on borders of woods, or gravelly ground, sometimes among pine
needles. Large troops of it were frequent, and tufts containing many
individuals were common.

I regard B. subaureus as among the most valuable of our food species.
Its plentifulness, lateness, excellent quality will commend it to all
Mycophagists. It can be cooked in any way. The tubes need not be
removed.

=B. hirtel´lus= Pk.—slightly hairy. =Pileus= broadly convex, soft,
viscose, golden-yellow, adorned with _small tufts of hairs or fibrils_.
=Flesh= pale-yellow. =Tubes= adnate, medium size, angular, becoming
dingy-ochraceous. =Stem= subcespitose, equal, stout, glandular dotted,
yellow. =Spores= pale, _ochraceous-brown_, 9–10×4µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Sandy soil under pine trees. New York, _Peck_.

This species is very rare and was formerly confused with the preceding
from which it is separated by the hairy adornment of the pileus and the
darker, more brown color of the spores. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. punc´tipes= Pk.—_punctum_, a dot; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= convex or
nearly plane, glutinous when moist, yellow, the thin margin at first
minutely grayish-pulverulent, becoming recurved with age. =Tubes= short,
nearly plane, adnate, small, subrotund, _at first brownish_, then
sordid-ochraceous. =Stem= rather long, _tapering upward_,
grandular-dotted, _rhubarb-yellow_. =Spores= 9–10×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3–5 lines thick. Mixed
woods. New York, _Peck_.

The rhubarb-colored stem and the brownish color of the young hymenium
are the distinguishing features of this species. The glandules occur
also on the tubes. The species is rare. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Not seen by Professor Peck since its discovery in 1878.

Spores when first dropped are olive-green on white paper, but the green
hue soon changes to brownish-ochraceous. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N. Y. State
Bot.

Ontario, _Prof. Dearness_ (_Lloyd_, R. 4).


=B. al´bus= Pk.—white. =Pileus= convex, viscid when moist, _white_.
=Flesh= white or yellowish. =Tubes= plane, small or medium, subrotund,
adnate, whitish, becoming yellow or ochraceous. =Stem= equal or slightly
tapering downward, both it and the tubes glandular-dotted, _white_,
sometimes tinged with pink toward the base. =Spores= ochraceous,
subfusiform, 8–9×4µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 3–5 lines thick.

Woods, especially of pine or hemlock. New York, _Peck_; New England,
_Frost_.

This species is easily known by its white pileus, but its color is lost
in drying. Sometimes the fresh plant emits a peculiar fetid odor.
_Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. granula´tus=—_granula_, a granule. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane,
very viscid or glutinous and _rusty-brown_ when moist, _yellowish_ when
dry. =Flesh= pale-yellowish. =Tubes= short, adnate, yellowish, their
mouths simple, granulated. =Stem= dotted with glandules above,
pale-yellowish. =Spores= spindle-shaped, yellowish-orange, 7.5–10×2–3µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Woods, especially of pine and in open places under or near pine trees.
Very common.

The plant is generally gregarious and sometimes grows in circles, whence
the name B. circinans Pers. Occasionally it is cespitose. The pileus is
very variable in color—pinkish-gray, reddish-brown, yellowish-gray,
tawny-ferruginous or brownish—and is sometimes obscurely spotted by the
drying gluten. The flesh is rather thick and often almost white, except
near the tubes, where it is tinged with yellow. The tubes are small, at
first almost white or very pale-yellow, but they become dingy-ochraceous
with age. The stem is generally short, stout and firm, whitish-pallid or
yellowish, and often dotted to the base, though the glandules are more
numerous and distinct on the upper part. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

B. granulatus is of frequent and general occurrence. I have found it in
the pine woods of New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia, and in West Virginia and Pennsylvania in mixed woods.

It is a late-growing species, appearing in September and continuing
until frost.

All authors, with one exception (Gillet), give the species as edible.
From frequent and copious testings, the writer vouches for its edibility
and excellence. It bears favorable comparison with any of the late
Boleti.


=B. bre´vipes= Pk.—_brevis_, short; _pes_, foot. =Pileus= thick, convex,
covered with a _thick, tough gluten_ when young or moist, _dark chestnut
color_, sometimes fading to dingy-tawny, the margin inflexed. =Flesh=
white or tinged with yellow. =Tubes= short, nearly plane, adnate or
slightly depressed around the stem, small, subrotund, at first whitish
becoming dingy-ochraceous. =Stem= whitish, _not dotted or rarely with a
few very minute inconspicuous dots at the apex, very short_. =Spores=
subfusiform, 7.5×3µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–2.5 in. broad. =Stem= .5–1 in. long, 3–5 lines thick.

Sandy soil in pine groves and woods. New England, _Frost;_ New York,
_Peck_.

The species is closely related to B. granulatus, from which it differs
especially in its darker colored pileus, more copious gluten, shorter
stem and the almost entire absence of granules from the tube mouths and
stem. In the rare instances in which these are present they are
extremely minute and inconspicuous. The plant occurs very late in the
season and the pileus appears as if enveloped in slime and resting
stemless on the ground. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Specimens found in pine woods of New Jersey, identified by Professor
Peck. Lambertville, N.J., _C.S. Ridgway_; Haddonfield, N.J., _T.J.
Collins_; Pleasantville, _Isaac F. Shaner_.

B. brevipes is a disreputable, dirty, tramp-looking fungus, from which
the collector would expect no good. Nevertheless, when it has had a good
scrubbing it becomes respectable and is sweet, tender, good eating. When
other species abound, it does not pay for the cleansing.


=B. collini´tus= Fr.—_collino_, to besmear. =Pileus= convex, even,
_becoming pale when the brown gluten separates_. =Flesh= white. =Tubes=
adnate, elongated, naked, _the mouths two-parted_, pallid, becoming
yellow. =Stem= firm, often tapering downward, _somewhat reticulate with
appressed squamules_, white, becoming brown.

Woods of pine or fir. North Carolina, _Curtis_; New England, _Frost_.

I have seen no specimens of this apparently rare species. It is said to
be solitary in its mode of growth and to resemble B. luteus in size and
color, but to be distinct from it by its ringless, dotless stem. Dr.
Curtis records it as edible. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

I found three specimens at Haddonfield, N.J., October, 1897, under scrub
pines. Cap 2½ in. across, convex, gibbous; stem equal, 2½ in. long, ½
in. in diameter, slightly tapering at base. The two-parted mouths to the
tubes were very distinct. The stems were tough, but the caps, washed and
fried, were good.


=B. di´chrous= Ellis. =Pileus= convex, viscose, _dull red_. =Flesh=
soft, dull, yellowish-white, _changing to greenish-blue_ where wounded,
finally yellow. =Tubes= subdepressed around the stem, large, unequal,
straw-colored, changing color like the flesh where wounded. =Stem=
thickened below, solid, covered with a _red scaly coat_, except at the
yellow apex, yellow within. =Spores= elliptical, slightly bent at one
end, 2µ long.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 3 in. long, 6 lines thick.

Dry soil in oak and pine woods. New Jersey. _Ellis._

I have seen no specimens of this species. From the description, its
affinities appear to be with B. bicolor, but it is placed here because
of its viscose pileus. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. ba´dius= Fr.—bay-brown. =Pileus= convex, even, soft, viscose or
glutinous, shining when dry, _tawny-chestnut_. =Flesh= whitish, tinged
with yellow, bluish next the tubes. =Tubes= large, angular, long, adnate
or sinuate-depressed, whitish-yellow, becoming tinged with green. =Stem=
subequal, even, solid, paler, _brown-pruinate_. =Spores= fusoid-oblong.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 3–5 lines thick.

Woods, especially of pine. New York, _Peck_; Minnesota, _Johnson_;
Wisconsin, _Bundy_; Nova Scotia, _Somers_.

In the American plant the spores are 10–12×4–5µ.

Cordier classes it among the edible species. _Peck_, Boleti of the
United States.


=B. mi´tis= Krombh.—mild. =Pileus= convex, then plane or depressed,
firm, viscid, yellowish-flesh color, reddish-rust color when dry.
=Flesh= pale, grayish-yellow. =Tubes= _short, olivaceous or
golden-yellow_, their mouths compound, angular, unequal. =Stem= firm,
short, even, narrowed toward the base, colored like the pileus. =Spores=
12–14×4µ.

=Pileus= 2–2.5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–2.5 in. long.

Mixed woods. New England, _Frost_.

This species is unknown to me and is recorded by Mr. Frost only. _Peck_,
Boleti of the United States.


=B. uni´color= Frost MS. =Pileus= broadly convex or nearly plane, viscid
when moist, even, sometimes streaked as if with minute innate brown
fibrils, _pale-yellow_. =Flesh= _pale-yellow_. =Tubes= adnate or
slightly decurrent, rather short, compound, _lemon-yellow_, becoming
darker with age. =Stem= _even_, equal or narrowed toward the base,
colored like the pileus. =Spores= reddish-yellow, 9–11×4µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Pine woods and open sedgy places. New England, _Frost_.

Specimens not seen. The species seems too near B. bovinus, of which it
may possibly be a variety, but its yellow flesh and the colors ascribed
to the tubes and spores require its separation. Rev. C.J. Curtis sends
notes of a species found by him in North Carolina, which agree with this
in its characters so far as noted. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. ignora´tus= Pk. =Pileus= convex, viscid, bright lemon-color, marked
with wrinkled lines of orange color, which are distributed over the
pileus, giving it a streaked appearance. =Flesh= white, solid, does not
change color when cut or broken; taste slightly acid. =Pores=
lemon-color, moderately large, free, connected with the stem by web-like
filaments. =Stem= larger at the apex, somewhat tapering toward the base,
yellow, smooth, solid. =Spores= 4.5×11µ.

This closely approaches Boletus unicolor Fr., from which it scarcely
differs except in its white flesh and free tubes. Fungi of Maryland,
_Mary E. Banning_. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=B. bovi´nus=—_bos_, an ox. =Pileus= nearly plane, glabrous, viscid,
pale yellow. =Flesh= _white_. =Tubes= very short, subdecurrent, their
mouths compound, pale yellow or grayish, becoming rust-colored. =Stem=
equal, even, colored like the pileus. =Spores= fusiform, dingy
greenish-ocher, 7.5–10×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–2 in. long, sometimes cespitose.

Pine woods. North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Pennsylvania,
_Schweinitz_; New England, _Frost_, _Palmer_, _Bennett_, _Sprague_,
_Farlow_; California, _H. and M._

The shallow tubes, 2–3 lines long, are said to resemble the pores of
Merulius lacrymans. The species is recorded edible by Curtis, Gillet and
Palmer. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia mountains under hemlocks, 1882–1885, and near Haddonfield,
N.J., under pines. _McIlvaine_, 1892. Gregarious and in clusters. The
pore surface was in some specimens broadly wrinkled.

Smell and taste pleasant. Cooked, the quality is of the best in Boleti.


=B. rubinel´lus= Pk.—dim. of _ruber_, red. =Pileus= broadly conical or
convex, viscid when moist, subtomentose or slightly pubescent when dry,
_red fading to yellow on the margin_. =Flesh= whitish or yellowish,
taste _mild_. =Tubes= adnate or slightly depressed around the stem,
dingy-reddish, becoming subferruginous. =Stem= equal, slender, even,
colored like the tubes, _yellow within_, sometimes yellow at the base.
=Spores= oblong-fusiform, ferruginous-brown, 12.5–15×4µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 1–3 lines thick.

=B. pipera´tus= Bull.—_piper_, pepper. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane,
glabrous, _slightly viscid_ when moist, _yellowish, cinnamon or
subferruginous_. =Flesh= white or yellowish, taste _acrid, peppery_.
=Tubes= rather long and large, angular, often unequal, plane or convex,
adnate or subdecurrent, _reddish-rust color_. =Stem= slender, subequal,
tawny-yellow, bright yellow at the base. =Spores= subfusiform,
ferruginous-brown, 9–11×4µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Woods and open places. Common and variable.

This species may easily be recognized by its peppery flavor. The pileus
sometimes appears as if slightly tomentose, and both this and the
preceding species recede from the character of the tribe by the slight
viscidity of the pileus. This is sometimes cracked into areas and
sometimes the margin is very obtuse by the elongation of the tubes.
_Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Haddonfield, N.J., 1892. _McIlvaine._

This fungus is reckoned poisonous by Stevenson. Massee gives its taste
as very hot. The taste of the American plant is peppery but not
offensively so. This pepperiness it loses in cooking. It has been eaten
by the writer and his friends with enjoyment and without any discomfort.

=B. subsanguin´eus= Pk.—_sub_ and _sanguineus_, bloody. (Plate CXVI,

glabrous, viscid, bright-red or scarlet. =Flesh= thick, firm but
flexible, white, slowly changing to a pale brownish-lilac on exposure to
the air, taste slightly bitter. =Tubes= very short, 2–4 mm. long,
adnate, but often separating from the stem with the expansion of the
pileus, reddish, the mouths minute, stuffed at first, pinkish, then
brownish-yellow, changing to a light-brown where wounded. =Stem= short,
thick, uneven, often tapering downward, streaked with red, pale-yellow
at the top, white at the base, marked at the top by the decurrent walls
of the tubes.

=Pileus= 2.5–10 cm. broad. =Stem= 2.5–5 cm. long, 2–4 cm. thick.

Solitary, gregarious or cespitose. Under beech trees. West Philadelphia,
Pa. August. _C. McIlvaine._

This is a very showy species, easily recognized by its bright-red viscid
pileus and its short, thick and uneven or somewhat lacunose stem. It is
closely related to the European B. sanguineus With., from which it is
separated by its minute tubes, its uneven stem and the brownish hues
assumed where wounded.

The spore characters of this and the four succeeding species are
unknown, but the other characters are quite distinctive and apparently
sufficient for the recognition of the species. The descriptions have
been derived from colored figures and other data furnished by Mr.
McIlvaine, who says all are edible. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, No.
27.

When slowly stewed for thirty minutes, there is no better Boletus.


                             PULVERULENTI.

=Pileus= clothed with a yellow dust or a yellow powdery down. =Stem=
more or less yellow powdered, neither bulbous nor distinctly
reticulated.

The species which constitute this tribe are easily distinguished from
all others by the sulphur-colored pulverulence which coats the pileus
and stem like a universal veil. They appear thus far to be peculiar to
this country. Though strongly resembling each other in the tribal
character they are very diverse in other respects. One species, by its
viscidity, connects with the preceding tribe; another by its differently
colored tube mouths is related to the Luridi; and the third is peculiar
in its ligneous habitat.

=B. hemichry´sus= B. and C.—half-golden. =Pileus= convex, at length
plane or irregularly depressed, floccose-squamulose, covered with a
yellow powder, sometimes cracked, bright golden-yellow. =Flesh= thick,
_yellow_. =Tubes= adnate or decurrent, yellow, becoming reddish-brown,
the mouths large, angular. =Stem= _short, irregular, narrowed below_,
sprinkled with a yellow dust, yellowish tinged with red; mycelium
yellow. =Spores= oblong, minute, dingy-ochraceous.

Var. _muta´bilis_. =Flesh= slightly changing to blue where wounded.
=Stem= reddish, yellow within, sometimes eccentric. =Spores=

South Carolina, _Ravenel_; North Carolina, _Curtis_; New York, _Peck_.

The species is remarkable for its habitat, which is lignicolous. The New
York variety grew on a stump of white pine. By its eccentric stem it
connects this genus with Boletinus, through Boletinus porosus. According
to the authors of this species it resembles Boletus variegatus. _Peck_,
Boleti of the U.S.


=B. Ravenel´ii= B. and C.—after Ravenel. =Pileus= convex or nearly
plane, _slightly viscid when young or moist_, covered with a
sulphur-yellow powdery down, becoming naked and dull-red on the disk.
=Flesh= whitish. =Tubes= at first plane, _adnate_, pale-yellow, becoming
yellowish-brown or umber, dingy-greenish where bruised, the mouths large
or medium size, subrotund. =Stem= nearly equal, clothed and colored like
the young pileus, yellow within, with a slight evanescent webby or
tomentose ring. =Spores= ochraceous-brown, 10–12×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–4 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Woods and copses. South Carolina, _Ravenel_; North Carolina, _Curtis_;
New York, _Peck_; New England, _Frost_.

This is a very distinct and very beautiful species. Mr. Ravenel remarks
in his notes that “this plant is not infested by larvæ and preserves
more constant characters than any other Boletus with which I am
acquainted.” The webby powdered filaments constitute a universal veil
which at first covers the whole plant and conceals the young tubes. As
the pileus expands this generally disappears from the disk, and,
separating between the margin and the stem, a part adheres to each. The
flesh is sometimes stained with yellow. The tubes in some instances
become convex and slightly depressed around the stem. They are almost
white when young, and often exhibit brownish hues where wounded. The
plant is sometimes cespitose. I have observed a greenish tint to the
freshly shed spores, but it soon disappears. Boletus subchromeus Frost
Ms. is this species. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. auriflam´meus= B. and C.—flaming yellow. =Pileus= convex, _dry_,
powdered, bright golden-yellow. =Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Tubes=
plane or convex, _free_, yellow, their broad angular _mouths scarlet_.
=Stem= slightly tapering upward, powdered, colored like the pileus.
=Spores= 10–12.5×5µ.

=Pileus= 8–12 lines broad. =Stem= 1–1.5 in. long.

Woods. North Carolina, _Curtis_; New York, _Peck_.

This is evidently a rare species and as beautiful as it is rare. The
whole plant is bright-yellow except the tube mouths, and is sprinkled
with yellow dust or minute yellow branny particles. In the New York
specimen the scarlet color is wanting in the marginal tube mouths and
the stem is marked with fine subreticulating elevated lines. In other
respects it agrees well with the diagnosis of the species. _Peck_,
Boleti of the U.S.


                SUBPRUINOSI—_sub_, _pruina_, hoar frost.

=Pileus= glabrous, but more often pruinose. =Tubes= adnate, yellowish.
=Stem= equal, even, neither bulbous nor reticulated.

The species of this tribe have the pileus neither viscid nor distinctly
and permanently tomentose. Typically it is glabrous or merely pruinose,
but Fries has admitted into the group one species with a pulverulent,
and one with a silky pileus. The species are not sharply distinguished
from those of the following tribes, and possibly some have been admitted
here which might as well have been placed there. Some of the species are
variable in color and their characters are not sufficiently well known.

becoming sordid-yellow. =Stem= lemon-yellow with red or rhubarb stains
at the base, contracted at the top when young, subcespitose. =Spores=
10–12.5×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–6 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Woods and their borders. New England, _Frost_; New York, _Peck_.

Though the sensitive Boletus differs considerably in some respects from
the olive-red Boletus, it is probably only a variety, and as such I have
subjoined it here. In it every part of the plant quickly changes to blue
where wounded, and even the pressure of the fingers in handling the
fresh specimens is sufficient to induce this change of color. I have not
found the typical plant in New York, but specimens received from Mr.
Frost are not, in the dry state, distinguishable from the variety.
_Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; West Virginia. Haddonfield, N.J. Cheltenham,
Pa., _McIlvaine_.

Years ago I marked it edible and excellent when young. My friends have
eaten it, and continue to do so. Yet Professor Peck (48th Rep., p. 202)
reports a case brought to his notice of an entire family being sickened
by eating B. sensibilis. All recovered. It may, therefore, be one of
those species which, while disagreeing with some persons, can be eaten
by the majority. Clitocybe illudens, Lepiota Morgani and others of the
Agaricaceæ are such species.

=B. bi´color= Pk.—two-color. (Plate CXVII, figs. 1, 2, p. 424.) =Pileus=
convex, glabrous or merely pruinose-tomentose, dark-red, firm, becoming
soft, paler and sometimes spotted or stained with yellow when old.
=Flesh= yellow, not at all or but slightly and slowly changing to blue
where wounded. =Tubes= nearly plane, adnate, bright-yellow, becoming
ochraceous, slowly changing to blue where wounded, their mouths small,

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Woods and open places. New York, _Peck_; Wisconsin, _Bundy_.

The color of this plant is somewhat variable. In the typical form the
pileus and stem are dark red, approaching Indian red, but when old the
color of the pileus fades and is often intermingled with yellow. The
surface sometimes cracks and becomes cracked in areas. From the European
B. Barlæ this species is separated by its solid stem; from B. versicolor
by its small tube mouths and its red stem. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Plentiful at Mt. Gretna, Pa., July, August, September, 1898, in mixed
woods. Very variable in shape and color. Identified by Professor Peck
from painting and description.

Fine eating, one of the very best.


=B. glabel´lus= Pk.—smooth. =Pileus= fleshy, thick, broadly convex or
nearly plane, soft, dry, subglabrous, _smoky-buff_. =Flesh= _white_,
both it and the tubes changing to blue where wounded. =Tubes= nearly
plane, adnate, ochraceous, tinged with green, their mouths small,
subrotund. =Stem= subequal, glabrous, even, reddish toward the base,
pallid above, with a _narrow reddish circumscribing zone or line at the
top_. =Spores= oblong, brownish-ochraceous, tinged with green when
fresh, 10–12.5×4µ.

=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 5–10 lines thick.

Grassy ground under oaks. New York, _Peck_.

The species is well marked by the reddish band or line on the stem just
below the tubes, but this disappears in drying. _Peck_, Boleti of the
U.S.


=B. aluta´ceus= Morgan—yellowish. =Pileus= cushion-shaped, glabrous,
_alutaceous_ with a tinge of red. =Flesh= _white, inclining to reddish_.
=Tubes= semifree, medium in size, unequal, angular, greenish-yellow.
=Stem= nearly equal, striate, reticulate at the apex, colored like the
pileus. =Spores= fusiform, brownish-olive, 12.5×5µ.

=Pileus= 3 in. broad.

Rocky woods of oak and chestnut. Kentucky, _Morgan_.

The general aspect of the figure of this species recalls some of the
forms of Boletus subtomentosus. The tubes are nearly equal in length to
the thickness of the flesh of the pileus. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Quite frequent at Mt. Gretna, Pa., in mixed woods, principally oak and
chestnut.

Stem should be removed, and tubes when old. It cooks well and is
especially good.


=B. tenui´culus= Frost—thin. =Pileus= nearly plane, _thin_, lurid-red on
a yellow ground. =Flesh= unchangeable. =Tubes= short, adnate, small,
_golden-yellow_. =Stem= _slender_, equal, colored like the pileus.
=Spores= 10×6µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 4–6 in. long.

Woods. New England. _Frost._

The thin pileus and long slender stem readily distinguish this species.

=B. auri´porus= Pk.—golden-pore. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane,
glabrous or merely pruinose-tomentose, grayish-brown, yellowish-brown,
or reddish-brown. =Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Tubes= plane or slightly
depressed around the stem, adnate or subdecurrent, _bright
golden-yellow, retaining their color when dried_. =Stem= equal or
slightly thickened at the base, _viscid or glutinous when moist_,
especially toward the base, colored like or a little paler than the
pileus. =Spores= 7.5–10×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Thin woods and shaded banks. New York, _Peck_; New England, _Frost_.

This species is remarkable for the rich yellow color of the tubes, which
is retained unchanged in the dried specimens, and for the viscid stem.
This character, however, is not noticeable in dry weather and was
overlooked in the original specimens.

yellowish-brown, slightly cracked in areas when old, yellow in the
interstices. =Flesh= white. =Tubes= adnate, lemon-yellow, unchangeable.
=Stem= slender, short, much thickened at the base in large specimens,
yellowish, streaked with brown, brownish within. =Spores= 10×5µ.

=B. parasi´ticu=s Bull.—a parasite. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane,
dry, silky, becoming glabrous, _soon tessellately cracked_, grayish or
dingy-yellow. =Tubes= decurrent, medium size, _golden yellow_. =Stem=
equal, rigid, incurved, yellow without and within. =Spores=
oblong-fusiform, pale-brown, 12.5–15×4µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Parasitic on species of Scleroderma. New York, _Gerard_; New England,
_Sprague_, _Bennett_.

This species is very rare in this country. It is remarkable for its
peculiar habitat. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

New York, _Lydia M. Patchen_; Westfield, on Scleroderma vulgare.

I found many specimens of this rare species during August, 1897, growing
on Scleroderma vulgare.

Professor Peck, to whom I sent specimens, identified them as B.
parasiticus. The tubes were large, unequal, dissepiments thin,
decurrent. The Sclerodermas frequently appear to be parasitic upon the
Boletus. I have seen the host plant thrown entirely free from the ground
by the Boletus.

B. parasiticus is edible, but it is not of agreeable flavor.


=B. dictyoceph´alus= Pk.—reticulate. =Pileus= convex, glabrous,
_reticulate with brown lines beneath the thin separable cuticle_,
brownish-orange, darker in the center and there tinged with pink.
=Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Tubes= nearly plane, slightly depressed
around the stem, grayish-yellow, becoming brown where bruised. =Stem=
equal or slightly tapering at the top, solid, rimose, dotted with
scales, lemon-yellow, darker toward the base. =Spores= 15–20×6µ.

=Pileus= 2.5 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 5–6 lines thick.

Mixed woods. North Carolina. _C.J. Curtis._

The description here given has been derived from a single dried specimen
and from the notes kindly sent by Mr. Curtis. The species is apparently
well marked and very distinct by the peculiar reticulations of the
pileus. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. subgla´bripes= Pk.—rather smooth. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane,
glabrous, reddish inclining to chestnut color. =Flesh= white,
unchangeable. =Tubes= adnate, nearly plane in the mass, pale yellow,
becoming convex and darker or greenish-yellow with age, the mouths
small, subrotund. =Stem= equal, solid, scurfy, pale yellow. =Spores=
oblong-fusiform, 12.5–15×4–5µ.

The smoothish-stemmed Boletus is well marked by its cylindric minutely
scurfy stem which is colored like the tubes. Its cap is smooth and
nearly always some shade of red or bay. Specimens occur occasionally in
which it approaches grayish-brown or wood-brown. The flesh is white and
unchangeable when cut or broken.

The tubes at first have a nearly plane surface, but this becomes
somewhat convex with age, and slightly depressed around the stem. The
tube mouths are small and nearly round. The color of the tubes is at
first a beautiful pale yellow, but it becomes darker or slightly
greenish-yellow with age.

The stem is colored very nearly like the tubes, but sometimes it has a
slight reddish tint toward the base. Its peculiar feature consists of
the minute, branny particles upon it. They are so small and pale that
they are easily overlooked.

There is a variety in which the cap is corrugated or irregularly pitted
and wrinkled. Its name is Boletus subglabripes corrugis Pk.

The =cap= is 1½-4 in. broad, the =stem= is 2–3 in. long and 4–8 lines
thick. The plants are found in woods in July and August. _Peck_, 51st
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=B. pal´lidus= Frost—pale. (Plate CXVII, fig. 4, p. 424.) =Pileus=
convex, becoming plane or centrally depressed, soft, glabrous, pallid or
brownish-white, sometimes tinged with red. =Flesh= white. =Tubes= plane
or slightly depressed around the stem, nearly adnate, _very pale or
whitish-yellow_, becoming darker with age, _changing to blue where
wounded_, the mouths small. =Stem= equal or slightly thickened toward
the base, rather long, glabrous, often flexuous, whitish, sometimes
streaked with brown, often tinged with red within. =Spores= pale
ochraceous-brown, 10–12×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 lines long, 4–8 lines thick.

Woods. New England, _Frost_; New York, _Peck_.

The species is readily recognized by its dull pale color, rather long
stem, and tubes changing to blue where wounded. _Peck_, Boleti of the
U.S.

Common in West Virginia mountains, Angora, West Philadelphia, Mt.
Gretna, Pa. Solitary, on ground in mixed woods.

The caps are tender and delicately flavored.


=B. rubropunc´tus= Pk.—red-dotted. (Plate CXVII, fig. 3, p. 424.)
=Pileus= convex, glabrous, reddish-brown. =Flesh= yellowish,
unchangeable. =Tubes= nearly plane, depressed about the stem, their
mouths small, round, bright golden-yellow, not changing color where
bruised. =Stem= firm, solid, tapering upward, yellow, punctate with
reddish dots or squamules. =Spores= olive-green, 12.5×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Woods. Port Jefferson. July. Cold Spring Harbor, _H.C. Beardslee_.

This is a pretty Boletus, well marked by the red dots of the stem. It is
apparently a very rare species. B. radicans is said to have the stem
sprinkled with red particles, but that is a larger plant with the margin
of the pileus persistently involute or incurved and with a radicating
stem, characters which are not shown by our fungus. _Peck_, 50th Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

I found my specimens at Mt. Gretna, Pa., August-September, 1898.

Identified for the writer by Professor Peck from painting and
description.

Taste and smell slight. Cooks well and is pleasant to the taste. The
tubes should be removed.


               SUBTOMENTO´SI—_sub_, _tomentosus_, downy.

=Pileus= when young villose or subtomentose, rarely becoming glabrous
with age, destitute of a viscid pellicle. =Tubes= of one color, adnate.
=Stem= at first extended, neither bulbous nor reticulated with veins,
wrinkled or striated in some species. =Flesh= in some changing color
where wounded.

The tubes are generally yellow or greenish-yellow. In some species they
are occasionally somewhat depressed around the stem, but they do not
form a rounded free stratum, nor, with the exception of B. rubeus, are
they stuffed when young as in most of the Edules. The species are
scarcely separable from those of the preceding tribe except by the more
evidently tomentose young pileus.

=B. variega´tus= Swartz. =Pileus= at first convex, then plane, obtuse,
moist, sprinkled with _superficial bundled hairy squamules,
dark-yellow_, the acute margin at first flocculose. =Flesh= yellow, here
and there becoming blue. =Tubes= adnate, unequal, minute, _brown then
cinnamon_. =Stem= firm, equal, even, dark-yellow, sometimes reddish.
=Spores= oblong-ellipsoid, hyaline or very pale-yellowish, 7.5–10×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 6 lines thick.

Woods, especially of pine. North Carolina, _Curtis_, _Schweinitz_;
California, _Harkness_, _Moore_; Rhode Island, _Bennett_. _Peck_, Boleti
of the U.S.

West Virginia mountains, 1882–1885. Haddonfield, N.J., _McIlvaine_;
Doylestown, Pa., _Paschall_. Quite common on flat benches where hemlocks
and spruces have grown.

When the caps are cooked they are sweet, nutty, excellent.


=B. Roxa´næ= Frost. =Pileus= broadly convex, at first subtomentose, then
covered with red hairs in bundles, _yellowish-brown_. =Flesh=
yellowish-white. =Tubes= at first _whitish, then light-yellow_,
arcuate-adnate or slightly depressed around the stem, the mouths small.
=Stem= enlarged toward the base, striate at the apex, yellowish or
pale-cinnamon. =Spores= 10×4µ.

Var. _auri´color_. =Pileus= and subequal stem bright-yellow, the
tomentum of the pileus yellow.

=B. striæ´pes= Secr.—striate stem. =Pileus= convex or plane, soft,
silky, _olivaceous, the cuticle rust-color within_. =Flesh= white,
yellow next the tubes, sparingly changing to blue. =Tubes= adnate,
greenish, their mouths minute, angular, yellow. =Stem= firm, curved,
marked with _brownish-black striations_, yellow, velvety and
brownish-rufescent at the base. =Spores= 10–13×4µ.

Pine and oak woods. Minnesota, _Johnson_.

I have seen no specimens of this species, which is recorded from but one
locality in our country. The character—flesh sparingly changing to
blue—is given on the authority of Rev. M.J. Berkeley. _Peck_, Boleti of
the U.S.


=B. chrysen´teron= Fr.—golden within. =Pileus= convex or plane, soft,
floccose-squamulose, often cracked in areas, brown or brick-red. =Flesh=
_yellow, red beneath the cuticle_, often slightly changing to blue where
wounded. =Tubes= subadnate; greenish-yellow, _changing to blue where
wounded_; their mouths rather large, angular, unequal. =Stem= subequal,
rigid, fibrous-striate, red or pale-yellow. =Spores= fusiform,
pale-brown, 11–12.5×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Woods and mossy banks.

The species is common and very variable. The color of the pileus may be
yellowish-brown, reddish-brown, brick-red, tawny or olivaceous. The
subcutaneous reddish tint and the reddish chinks of the cracked pileus
are distinguishing features. Wounds of the tubes sometimes become blue
then greenish. Authors disagree concerning the edible qualities of this
Boletus. Stevenson gives it as edible, but Cordier and Gillet say that
it is regarded with suspicion. In one strongly marked form the tubes are
decidedly depressed around the stem, in another the flesh is whitish
tinged with red. It may be doubted whether these are varieties or
distinct species. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

I have found, and eaten plentifully of this species in West Virginia,
North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, from July until October. I
have no hesitancy in recommending it in all of its varieties. Excepting
from very young specimens the tubes and stems should be removed. The
flesh is sweet, delicate and toothsome.


=B. fumo´sipes= Pk. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane, minutely tomentose,
sometimes minutely rivulose, dark olive-brown. =Flesh= whitish. =Tubes=
at first nearly plane, becoming convex with age, their mouths whitish
when young, becoming yellowish-brown, changing to bluish-black where
bruised. =Stem= equal, solid, smoky-brown, minutely scurfy under a lens.
=Spores= purplish-brown, 12.5–15×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 3–4 lines thick.

Woods. Port Jefferson. July.

This species resembles small dark-colored forms of B. chrysenteron, and
this resemblance is still more noticeable in those specimens in which
the pileus cracks in areas, for in these the chinks become red as in
that species. The different color of the stem and tubes will at once
separate these species. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=B. ru´beus= Frost—red. =Pileus= broadly convex, very finely appressed
subtomentose, bright brick-red when young, becoming mottled with red and
yellow, _yellow under the cuticle_, the thin margin at first inflexed,
then horizontal, curved upward when old. =Flesh= pale-yellow, changing
to blue where wounded. =Tubes= adnate or slightly depressed around the
stem, lemon-yellow and _stuffed when young_, becoming yellow and
sometimes red at the mouths. =Stem= small, often flexuous, colored like
the pileus, reddish within, white-tomentose at the base. =Spores=
9–12.5×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, 3–5 lines thick.

Deep woods. Rare. New England, _Frost_.

This is apparently too closely related to B. chrysenteron, and it also
resembles B. bicolor. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. frater´nus= Pk. =Pileus= convex, becoming plane or depressed,
slightly tomentose, deep red when young, becoming dull red with age.
=Flesh= yellow, slowly changing to greenish-blue where wounded. =Tubes=
rather long, becoming ventricose, slightly depressed about the stem,
their walls sometimes slightly decurrent, the mouths large, angular or
irregular, sometimes compound, bright yellow, quickly changing to blue
where wounded. =Stem= short, cespitose, often irregular, solid,
subtomentose, slightly velvety at the base, pale reddish-yellow, paler
above and below, yellow within, quickly changing to dark green where
wounded. =Spores= 12.5×6µ.

=Pileus= 1–1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–1.5 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Shaded streets. Auburn, Alabama. July. Underwood.

The species is apparently allied to B. rubeus, but is very distinct by
its small size, cespitose habit, color of the flesh of the stem and by
the peculiar hues assumed where wounded. When the pileus cracks the
chinks become yellow as in B. subtomentosus. The species belongs to the
tribe Subtomentosi. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.


=B. subtomento´sus= L.—_sub_; _tomentosus_, downy. =Pileus= convex or
nearly plane, soft, dry, _villoso-tomentose, subolivaceous, concolorous
beneath the cuticle_, often cracked in areas. =Flesh= white or pallid.
=Tubes= adnate or somewhat depressed around the stem, yellow, their
mouths large, angular. =Stem= stout, somewhat ribbed-sulcate, scabrous
or scurfy with minute dots. =Spores= 10–12.5×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2.5 in. long, 2–5 lines thick.

Common and variable. The pileus is usually olivaceous or
yellowish-brown, but it may be reddish-brown or tawny-red. When it
cracks the chinks become yellow. The species, as I understand it, may be
distinguished from its near relative, B. chrysenteron, by its paler
flesh, the clearer yellow tubes not changing to blue where wounded, and
by the chinks of the pileus becoming yellow. The species is recorded
edible by Cordier, Curtis and Palmer. Gillet says it is only medium in
quality. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Found and eaten in West Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania. Specimens received from Indiana, Minnesota, Alabama. I
have not seen any change of color in flesh or tubes. It is common in
Woodland Cemetery and Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. If the tubes are not
removed the dish is slimy. The B. chrysenteron also makes such a dish
when stewed, but fried, and well done, both species are decidedly good.


=B. cæspito´sus= Pk.—cespitose. =Pileus= broadly convex or nearly plane,
sometimes slightly concave by the elevation of the margin, even, brown
or blackish-brown, the margin often a little paler or reddish-brown.
=Flesh= slightly tinged with red. =Tubes= adnate or slightly decurrent,
yellow, their mouths rather large, angular, concolorous. =Stem= short,
even, solid, glabrous, tapering upward, brown or reddish-brown. =Spores=
oblong-elliptic, 10µ long, 5µ broad.

=Pileus= 1–2.5 cm. broad. =Stem= 2–2.5 cm. long, 4–6 mm. thick.

Cespitose. Virginia. August. _R.S. Phifer._

A small species growing in tufts and referable to the tribe
Subtomentosi. The tubes retain their bright yellow color in the dried
specimens. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, January 27, 1900.

Edible qualities not stated.


=B. spadi´ceus= Schaeff.—nut brown. =Pileus= convex or plane, moderately
compact, dry, tomentose, opaque, _date-brown_, irregularly cracked.
=Flesh= white, unchangeable, brownish-red above. =Tubes= adnate, yellow,
their mouths minute, subrotund. =Stem= firm, clavate, even,
_woolly-scaled_, yellow or brownish, yellowish-white within. =Spores=
12×4µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad.

Woods. New England, _Frost_.

This species is admitted on the authority of Mr. Frost who alone has
recorded it in this country. But specimens received from him under this
name do not in my opinion belong to it, and its occurrence here is
somewhat doubtful. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

In oak woods near Bartram’s Garden, West Philadelphia, in 1887–1888, I
found several Boleti answering the description, exactly, of B.
spadiceus. They proved to be good eating.


=B. radi´cans= Pers.—_radix_, a root. =Pileus= convex, dry,
subtomentose, olivaceous-cinereus, becoming pale-yellowish, the margin
thin, involute. =Flesh= pale-yellow, instantly changing to dark blue,
taste bitterish. =Tubes= adnate, their mouths large, unequal,
lemon-yellow. =Stem= even, _tapering downward and radicating, flocculose
with a reddish bloom_, pale-yellow, becoming naked and dark with a
touch.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2 in. long, 6 lines thick.

Woods. Ohio, _Morgan_.

Of the American plant Mr. Morgan says that the pileus is quite firm and
dry, becomes reddish or brownish-yellow and nearly glabrous, that the
flesh is pale-yellow, but that he has not observed any bluish tinge, and
that the spores are olive, fusiform, 10–12.5×5µ. Those of the European
plant have been described as very pale ocher, almost white, 6µ long, 3µ
broad. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Near Bryn Mawr, Pa. _W.C. Alderson_, 1894.

Several specimens brought to me were eaten. The change in color of flesh
was instantaneous upon exposure to the air. Taste strong and raw rather
than bitterish. The caps alone were cooked, and dish marked “fine.”


=B. muta´bilis= Morg.—changeable. Jour. Cin. Soc. Nat. Sci., Vol. VII.
=Pileus= convex, then plane or depressed, compact, dry, subtomentose,
_brown_. =Flesh= bright-yellow, _promptly changing to blue where
wounded_. =Tubes= adnate or subdecurrent, their mouths large, angular,
unequal, some of them compound, yellow changing to greenish yellow and
_quickly becoming blue where wounded_. =Stem= stout, solid, flexuous,
subsulcate, yellowish beneath the _brown dot-like scales_, bright yellow
within. =Spores= olive, fusiform, 12–13×5µ.

=Pileus= 2.5–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 6 lines thick.

Thick woods. Ohio, _Morgan_.

A shade of yellow sometimes appears beneath the brown of the pileus, and
as the plants grow old the pileus becomes blackish, glabrous and
shining. The stem increases in thickness above and downward. _Peck_,
Boleti of the U.S.


=B. badi´ceps= Pk.—_badius_, bay and head. (Plate CXVI, p. 420.)
=Pileus= firm, convex or somewhat centrally depressed when mature, dry,
velvety, obliquely truncate on the margin, bay-red or dark-maroon color.
=Flesh= white unchangeable, taste and odor mild, sweet, suggestive of
molasses. =Tubes= plane, adnate, white or whitish, becoming dingy with
age, the mouths minute. =Stem= equal or slightly swollen in the middle,
radicating, glabrous, solid, brownish.

=Pileus= 4–8 cm. broad. =Stem= 4–5 cm. long, 1.5–3 cm. thick.

Oak woods. West Philadelphia, Pa. August and September. _Charles
McIlvaine._

The truncate or beveled margin of the pileus is a striking feature in
this species. It is about 4 mm. broad and as even as if cut with a
knife. Sometimes the surface of the stem ruptures transversely just
below the top, the liberated shreds above curling upward against the
tubes and those below curving outward and downward. In mature plants
brownish spots appear in the flesh of the pileus. “When cooked it is of
high flavor and tender as kidney,” _C. McIlvaine._ _Peck_, Bull. Torrey
Bot. Club, January 27, 1900.

                      LACERI´PEDES—lacerated stem.

Stem elongated, coarsely pitted or deeply and lacunosely reticulated in
small hollows, the ridges somewhat intumescent in wet weather and more
or less lacerated, giving a rough or shaggy appearance to the stem.

The species of this tribe are few, very closely allied and so far as
known are peculiar to this country.

=B. Rus´selli= Frost—Russell’s Boletus. (Plate CXVIII, fig. 2, p. 436.)
=Pileus= thick, hemispherical or convex, _dry, covered with downy scales
or bundles of red hairs_, yellowish beneath the tomentum, often cracked
in areas. =Flesh= yellowish, unchangeable. =Tubes= subadnate, often
depressed around the stem, rather large, dingy-yellow or
yellowish-green. =Stem= very long, equal or tapering upward, roughened
by the lacerated margins of the reticular depressions, _red or
brownish-red_. =Spores= olive-brown, 18–22×8–10µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–7 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

This is distinguished from the other species by the dry squamulose
pileus and the color of the stem. The latter is sometimes curved at the
base. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

B. Russelli occurs in the West Virginia mountains, where I found and ate
it in August, 1883. Though solitary in its method of growth, it is
frequent in many parts of Pennsylvania, among leaves in mixed woods.
August to October.

Taste when raw, sweet, mild. Cooked it is rather soft, tasty. Tubes and
stem should be removed.


=B. Mor´gani= Pk. =Pileus= convex, soft, _glabrous viscid_, red or
yellow, or red fading to yellow on the margin. =Flesh= whitish tinged
with red and yellow, unchangeable. =Tubes= convex, depressed around the
stem, rather long and large, bright-yellow becoming greenish-yellow.
=Stem= elongated, tapering upward, pitted with long, narrow depressions,
_yellow, red in the depressions_, colored within like the flesh of the
pileus. =Spores= olive-brown, 18–22µ long, about half as broad.

=Pileus= 1.5–2.5 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Rocky hillsides in woods of deciduous trees. Kentucky, _Morgan_.

In wet weather the anastomosing ridges of the stem swell and become
broadly winged, thereby giving the stem a peculiar lacerated appearance.
The glabrous viscid pileus and the coloration of the stem distinguish
the species. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

B. Morgani is found in like localities with B. Russelli. Excepting in
its smooth, viscid cap and whitish flesh, it closely resembles the
latter. The ridges in the stems of both species swell when moist.

Its edible qualities are the same as B. Russelli.


=B. Be´tula= Schw.—birch. =Pileus= convex, viscose and shining in wet
weather, tessellately cracked and reticulated, orange-fawn color, rather
small. =Flesh= yellowish-white. =Tubes= separating, rather large,
_yellow_, almost like those of B. subtomentosus but _not greenish_.
=Stem= long, _attenuated downward_, everywhere covered with a deciduous
reticulated bark two lines high and separating like the bark of birches,
_pale-yellow without and within_.

=Pileus= 1.5 in. broad. =Stem= 5–6 in. long.

Ligneous earth. North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Pennsylvania,
_Schweinitz_. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

During several seasons I found B. Betula in Woodland Cemetery,
Philadelphia.

Edible qualities good.


                 CALO´PODES. _Gr_—beautiful; _Gr_—feet.

=Stem= stout, at first bulbous, typically venose-reticulated with veins.
=Tubes= adnate, their mouths not reddish.

The reticulate stem and adnate tubes of one color distinguish the
species of this tribe. In the Luridi the mouths of the tubes are
differently colored, and in the closely related Edules the tubes are
more or less depressed around the stem or sub-free, and their pores are
commonly stuffed when young. Fries did not admit species with whitish
tubes into this tribe, but we have done so in those cases in which this
was the only character to exclude them.

=B. specio´sus= Frost—handsome. =Pileus= at first very thick,
subglobose, compact, then softer, convex, glabrous or nearly so, red.
=Flesh= pale-yellow or bright lemon-yellow, changing to blue where
wounded. =Tubes= adnate, small, subrotund, plane or but slightly
depressed around the stem, bright lemon-yellow, becoming dingy-yellow
with age, changing to blue where wounded. =Stem= stout, subequal or
somewhat bulbous, reticulated, _bright lemon-yellow without and within_,
sometimes reddish at the base. =Spores= oblong-fusiform, pale
ochraceous-brown, 10–12.5×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 3–7 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 10–24 lines thick.

Thin woods. New England, _Frost_; New York, _Peck_.

This is a very beautiful Boletus. When young the whole plant except the
surface of the pileus is of a vivid lemon-yellow color. Wounds quickly
change to green, then to blue. The color of the pileus approaches
closely to solferino. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Caps of specimens found in mixed woods at Mt. Gretna, Pa., were minutely
areolate when old. Stems yellow at top and with purplish red over the
bright yellow toward the bulbous base, solid, bright yellow within.

Stems and caps are edible and rank high in flavor and texture.


=B. illu´dens= Pk.—deceiving. (Plate CXVIII, fig. 3, p. 436.) =Pileus=
convex, dry, subglabrous, yellowish-brown or grayish-brown, sometimes
tinged with red, especially in the center. =Flesh= pallid or yellowish.
=Tubes= bright yellow, plane or somewhat convex when old, adnate, their
mouths angular or subrotund, often larger near the stem. =Stem= nearly
equal, sometimes abruptly pointed at the base, glabrous, pallid or
yellowish, coarsely reticulated either wholly or at the top only.
=Spores= oblong or subfusiform, yellowish-brown tinged with green,
11–12.5×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–2.5 in. long, 3–5 lines thick.

Woods and copses. Port Jefferson. July. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

Found in plenty at Mt. Gretna, Pa., September, 1898. On ground and old
stumps in mixed woods. Identified by Professor Peck.

Taste and smell pleasant. Cooked as egg-plant it is one of the best.
Remove tubes.


=B. Peck´ii= Frost—after C.H. Peck. =Pileus= convex, firm, dry,
subglabrous, _red, fading to yellowish-red or buff-brown_ with age, the
margin usually retaining its red color longer than the disk. =Tubes=
adnate or slightly decurrent, nearly plane, yellow, changing to blue
where wounded. =Stem= equal or subventricose, reticulated, _red, yellow
at the top_. =Spores= oblong, pale ochraceous-brown, 9–12×4–5µ.

Var. _læ´vipes_. =Stem= reticulated above, even below.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Woods of frondose trees. New York, _Peck_. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. cal´opus= Fr. _Gr_—beautiful; _Gr_—foot. =Pileus= globose, then
convex, unpolished, _subtomentose, olivaceous_. =Flesh= pallid, slightly
changing to blue when wounded. =Tubes= adnate, their mouths minute,
angular, yellow. =Stem= firm, conical, then elongated and subequal,
reticulated, _wholly scarlet or at the apex only_, sometimes colored
like the pileus toward the base. =Spores= fusiform, yellowish-brown,
7–8×3–4µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= longer than the diameter of the pileus.

=B. orna´tipes= Pk.—ornate-stem. (Boletus retipes, Rep. 23.) =Pileus=
convex, firm, dry, glabrous or very minutely tomentose, _grayish-brown
or yellowish-brown_. =Flesh= yellow or pale-yellow. =Tubes= adnate,
plane, or concave, rarely convex, the mouths small or medium size,
clear-yellow. =Stem= firm, subequal, distinctly and beautifully
reticulated, yellow without and within. =Spores= oblong,
_ochraceous-brown_, 12–16×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Thin woods and open places. New York, _Peck_.

The color of the tubes becomes darker with age, but it does not change
to blue where wounded. The species is related to the next following one
with which it has sometimes been confused, but from which it is clearly
distinct. The color of the spores is quite dark and approaches
snuff-brown. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Edible. Good.


=B. re´tipes= B. and C.—reticulate stem. =Pileus= convex, dry, _powdered
with yellow_, sometimes rivulose or cracked in areas. =Tubes= adnate,
yellow. =Stem= subequal, _cespitose_, reticulate to the base,
_pulverulent below_. =Spores= _greenish-ochraceous_, 12–15×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

The tufted mode of growth, pulverulent pileus and paler-colored spores
separate this species from the preceding one. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia, 1882–1885. Mt. Gretna, Pa.; New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

The caps, alone, of this species, are desirable, the stems not cooking
well. Its way of bunching itself gratifies the collector, as do its
flavor and quality.


=B. pa´chypus= Fr. _Gr_—thick-footed. =Pileus= convex, subtomentose,
brownish or pale tan-color. =Flesh= thick, whitish, changing slightly to
blue. =Tubes= rather long, _somewhat depressed around the stem_, their
mouths round, pale-yellow, at length tinged with green. =Stem= thick,
firm, reticulated, at first ovate-bulbous, then elongated, equal,
_variegated with red and pale-yellow_. =Spores= large, _ovate_, pale
yellowish-ochraceous, 12.5–14×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 4–8 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long.

Woods, either of pine or beech.

This species is noted for its thick, stout stem, which sometimes attains
a diameter of more than two inches. It approaches the Edules in habit,
but according to Gillet it is poisonous, or at least to be suspected,
has a penetrating unpleasant odor and a somewhat nauseous flavor. He
also describes the pores as at first whitish. The stem is sometimes
intensely blood-red. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

A common species in West Virginia mountains, 1881–1885, in beech groves.
August to frost. It is rare in the pines of New Jersey, though I have
found it there. Like B. felleus, its size and attractiveness induce the
finder to over and over again try cooking it, hoping the discovery of a
successful way to rid it of its unpleasantness. I have never succeeded.
It is not poisonous.


=B. rimosel´lus= Pk.—cracked. =Pileus= broadly convex, flat or
irregular, glabrous, _tessellately cracked_, dark-brown. =Flesh=
whitish. =Tubes= adnate or sinuately decurrent, somewhat depressed
around the stem, pale-yellow, becoming _darker or brownish_ with age.
=Stem= tapering upward, broadly reticulated with brown veins,
_yellowish-white_. =Spores= _fusiform_, 15–17.5×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 6–9 lines thick.

Mixed woods. North Carolina, _C.J. Curtis_.

I have described this species from the notes and a single dried specimen
sent me by Mr. Curtis. More extended observation may require some
modification of the description. The color of the spores is described as
brown. They are remarkable for their size. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. modes´tus= Pk.—modest. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane, often
irregular, firm, dry, very minutely tomentose, _yellowish-brown_.
=Flesh= gray or pinkish-gray. =Tubes= nearly plane, adnate or
subdecurrent, the mouths angular, pale-ochraceous. =Stem= equal,
reticulated, brown. =Spores= elliptical, 10×5µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Grassy ground in thin woods. New York, _Peck_.

Miss Banning finds in Maryland what appears to be a form of this species
in which the part of the hymenium near the stem consists of lamellæ, the
rest of tubes. The species needs further investigation. _Peck_, Boleti
of the U.S.


=B. Cur´tisii= Berk.—after Dr. Curtis. =Pileus= hemispherical or convex,
_viscose, golden-yellow_. =Tubes= depressed around the stem, nearly
free, their mouths umber, at length tawny. =Stem= slender, attenuated
upward, polished, reticulated, straw-colored. =Spores= ferruginous,
subelliptical, slightly attenuated at each end.

=Pileus= 1 in. or more broad. =Stem= 2 in. long, 2–3 lines thick.

In the original description the stem of this species is said to be
hollow. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. gri´seus= Frost—gray. =Pileus= broadly convex, firm, dry,
subglabrous, _gray or grayish-black_. =Flesh= whitish or gray. =Tubes=
adnate or slightly depressed around the stem, nearly plane, their mouths
small, subrotund, _white or whitish_. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering
upward, distinctly reticulated, _whitish or yellowish_, sometimes
reddish toward the base. =Spores= ochraceous-brown, 10–14×4–5µ.

separable. =Tubes= long, convex, _decurrent_, white or whitish, becoming
brownish with age. =Stem= _flexuous_, solid, reticulated, whitish or

subglabrous, often cracked in areas, tawny-brown. =Flesh= at maturity
soft and similarly colored. =Tubes= concave or nearly plane, depressed
around the stem, their mouths small, angular, colored like the pileus.
=Stem= subequal, solid, reticulated, concolorous. =Spores= oblong or
subfusiform, 12.5–14×5µ. =Pileus= 2.5–5 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in.

The species is referable to the section Calopodes, but the tubes are
more or less depressed about the stem. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club,

                       EDU´LES—_edulis_, edible.

=Tubes= subfree, rounded-depressed around the stem, their mouths not at
first reddish, but commonly white-stuffed. =Stem= stout, bulbous as in
the Luridi but not, with a few exceptions, reticulate nor dotted with
pointed scales nor red. =Flesh= scarcely changeable. =Taste= pleasant.

This tribe is not sharply limited but partakes to some extent of the
characters of Calopodes and Luridi. From the former its nearly free and
at first white-stuffed tubes and its generally even stem separate it,
from the latter its tubes with concolorous mouths or at least with
mouths not red or reddish when young will distinguish it. The species
are generally of large or medium size and noted for their esculent
qualities.

brownish-red or dull-lilac, sometimes fading to yellowish on the margin.
=Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Tubes= at first nearly plane, adnate,

One of the handsomest of Boleti. It varies greatly in size and color,
but traces of purple or lilac are always detectable. The reticulations
upon the stem are often obscure, especially in young specimens.

It is pleasant when raw, and quite equal to any Boletus when cooked.

=B. edu´lis= Bull.—_edulis_, edible. (Plate CXVIII, fig. 5, p. 436.)
=Pileus= convex or nearly plane, _glabrous_, moist, at first compact,
then soft, variable in color, grayish-red, brownish-red or tawny-brown,
often paler on the margin. =Flesh= white or yellowish, reddish beneath

Virginia, _McIlvaine_.

Some species of fungi appear to have that prize of Fairyland—the Wishing
Cap—and by its power be able to take on any form they please. Boletus
edulis is one of them. Its variableness is puzzling. It is eaten
everywhere where found and is a favorite. Carefully sliced, dried and
kept where safe from mold it may be prepared for the table at any
season.


=B. edulis= Bull.—Var. _clavipes_ Pk. (Plate CXIX, fig. 1, p. 445.)
=Pileus= fleshy, convex, glabrous, grayish-red, bay-red or
chestnut-color. =Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Tubes= at first concave or
nearly plane, white and stuffed, then convex, slightly depressed around
the stem, ochraceous yellow. =Stem= mostly obclavate (inversely
club-shaped) and reticulate to the base. =Spores= oblong-fusiform,
12–15×4–5µ.

The club-stemmed Boletus is so closely related to the edible Boletus and
so closely connected by the intermediate forms that it seems to be only
a variety of it, but one worthy of illustration. It differs in the more
uniform color of the cap, in having the tubes less depressed around the
stem and less tinted with green when mature, and in having the stem more
club-shape and commonly reticulated to the base. The lower reticulations
are usually coarser but less permanent than the upper. The cap is more
highly colored when young and is apt to become paler with age, but the
margin does not become paler than the central part, as it so often does
in the edible Boletus. Individuals sometimes occur in which the stem is
nearly cylindric and reticulated only on the upper part. These connect
so closely with the edible Boletus that we have considered this to be a
mere variety of it. In size and in edible qualities it is very similar
to that species. _Peck_, 51st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Same in quality as B. edulis.


=B. vari´ipes= Pk.—variable stem. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane,
thick, soft, dry, _scaly, pointed scaly or minutely tomentose_, grayish
or pale grayish-brown, sometimes tinged with yellow or ochraceous.
=Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Tubes= convex or nearly plane, slightly
depressed around the stem, at first white, then greenish-yellow, their
mouths small, subrotund, _ochraceous_, stuffed when young. =Stem= firm,
reticulated, whitish or pallid. =Spores= oblong-fusiform,
ochraceous-brown tinged with green, 12–15×5µ. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. August, 1898. Stem slightly reticulated at top,
indistinctly striate below. Smell and taste strong, like B. felleus, but
sweetish, not bitter. When tubes are removed and cap fried it is
excellent.

Var. _al´bipes_. =Stem= whitish, wholly reticulated, the reticulations
coarser near the base. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. August, 1898. Taste slightly acrid, smell slight.
Excellent.

Var. _pallid´ipes_. =Stem= pallid, slightly furfuraceous, even or
obscurely reticulated toward the base, distinctly reticulated above.
_Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Satiny, shining. Taste slightly acrid, smell slight. Excellent.

Var. _tenu´ipes_. =Stem= slender, elongated. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. August, 1898, on decaying chestnut stump and on ground.
Excellent. _McIlvaine._

This species, with its varieties, grows in mixed woods, the density of
which has much to do with its general appearance. Individuals growing
where the sun plays upon them, show the reticulations plainer than those
maturing in the shade. The tubes should be removed before cooking. The
caps are best fried.


=B. exi´mius= Pk.—select. =Pileus= at first very compact, subglobose or
hemispherical, subpruinose, _purplish-brown or chocolate color_,
sometimes with a faint tinge of lilac, becoming convex, soft, smoky-red
or pale-chestnut. =Flesh= grayish or reddish-white. =Tubes= at first
concave or nearly plane, stuffed, colored nearly like the pileus,
becoming paler with age and depressed around the stem, their mouths
minute, rotund. =Stem= stout, generally short, equal or tapering upward,
abruptly narrowed at the base, _minutely branny_, colored like or a
little paler than the pileus, purplish-gray within. =Spores=
subferruginous, 12.5–15×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 3–10 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.

=B. lepro´sus= Pk.—leprous. Pileus very convex, glabrous, soft like kid,
cinereous-yellowish-drab or pale-brown, _slowly changing to whitish
where bruised_, the cuticle separable. =Flesh= _white, changing to
yellowish_. =Tubes= yellow or brownish-yellow, _changing to greenish
where_ wounded, plane, depressed around the stem, short, small, stuffed
when young. =Stem= solid, enlarged at the top, _lemon-yellow_. =Spores=
oblong-fusiform, 12.5–15×5µ.

=Pileus= 4–6 in. broad. =Stem= 2 in. long, 1 in. thick.

Mixed woods. North Carolina, _C.J. Curtis_.

This plant is remarkable for the whitish or leprous spots which the
pileus assumes, even from being handled, and for the change in the color
of the flesh and tubes. The stem is very thick at the top but tapers
downward. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


(Plate CXX.)

[Illustration: BOLETUS AFFINIS.]

=B. affi´nis= Pk.—related. =Pileus= convex above or nearly plane,
subglabrous, reddish-brown or chestnut color fading to tawny or
dingy-ochraceous with age. =Flesh= white. =Tubes= plane or convex,
adnate or slightly depressed around the stem, at first white and
stuffed, then glaucous-yellow or subochraceous, changing to
rusty-ochraceous where wounded. =Stem= subequal, even, glabrous, colored
like or paler than the pileus. =Spores= rusty-ochraceous, 9–12×4–5µ.

The Related boletus belongs to the tribe of Boleti known as Edules
because of their especially esculent character, but it differs from the
general character of the tribe in having its tubes not at all or but
slightly shortened around the stem and in its stem not being thickened
or bulbous at the base. The species is quite variable in the color of
the cap, which is generally darker in young plants, paler in old ones.
It may be brown, reddish-brown or blackish-brown when young, but is more
or less tinged with tawny or ochraceous when old. It is smooth and even
or minutely tomentose and sometimes slightly rugose. In wet weather the
margin of the cap sometimes curves upward, giving a very convex surface
to the tubes. Sometimes the wounded flesh slowly assumes a yellowish
hue. The peculiar rusty-ochraceous hue of the spores is also seen
sometimes in the tubes of old specimens. As in many species, the flesh
of old plants is more soft than that of young ones. The stem is quite
variable and is often narrowed downward. It is sometimes very obscurely
reticulated at the top.

The cap is generally 2–4 in. broad, the stem 1.5–3 in. long, 4–8 lines
thick. The plants are found in thin woods or in bushy places in July and
August.

Var. _maculo´sus_ Pk. differs from the type simply in having a few
yellowish spots scattered over the cap.

While not as high flavored as some Boleti this is, nevertheless, a
fairly good and perfectly safe one. _Peck_, 49th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Very open timber in Woodlands Cemetery, Philadelphia. August, 1898.
_McIlvaine._

A solitary species which does not appear to be plentiful. The whole
fungus is edible, but the stems and tubes are of different texture from
the caps and do not cook well with them.


=B. æstiva´lis= Fr.—pertaining to summer. =Pileus= convex or nearly
plane, even, _glabrous, whitish_, granulose in dry weather. =Flesh=
yellow below, white above. =Tubes= nearly free, the mouths minute,
equal, yellow. =Stem= very thick, bulbous, even, glabrous, pale yellow,
reddish within at the base. =Spores= elongated-oval, greenish-brown,
rather dark, 11×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 4–6 in. broad. =Stem= 4–5 in. long.

Woods and woodland pastures. Minnesota, _Johnson_; California, _H. and
M._

A large species, recorded as edible and said to be pleasant and delicate
in flavor. I have seen no specimens of this. _Peck_, Boleti of the
United States.

The flesh is sweet, nutty. Remove stems and tubes when old.


=B. impoli´tus= Fr.—unpolished. =Pileus= convex, dilated, _flocculose_,
at length grained in lines, unpolished, _tawny-brown_. =Flesh= white or
whitish, unchangeable, yellowish under the cuticle. =Tubes= free, their
mouths minute, yellow. =Stem= stout, subbulbous, even, _pubescent,
pale-yellow_, sometimes with a reddish zone near the top. =Spores= oval
or fusiform, pale greenish-brown, 7.5–10×5µ.

=Pileus= 4–6 in. broad. =Stem= 2 in. long.

Oak woods. California, _Harkness and Moore_.

This species is recorded as edible and said to be among the most
delicious. It is evidently rare in this country. According to Quelet the
spores are ellipsoid, papillate, 15–18µ long. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Near Bartram’s Garden, West Philadelphia, Pa., 1885. Thin mixed woods.
_McIlvaine._

That this species is edible and delicious is vouched for by many. I can
add my own pleasurable experience.


=B. deco´rus= Frost.—decorous. =Pileus= convex, rather firm, tomentose,
brownish tinged with red, the margin often darker colored. =Flesh=
white, unchangeable. =Tubes= becoming free, yellow, _changing to green
where wounded_. =Stem= bulbous, minutely branny, _brownish-red_, the
bulb sometimes white and attenuated at the base. =Spores= 13×5µ.

Rich woods. New England, _Frost_. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

edible qualities are excellent.


=B. lima´tulus= Frost—polished. =Pileus= nearly flat, thin, glabrous,
_viscid when moist_, somewhat polished and shining when dry, rich
yellowish-brown. =Flesh= _reddish in the pileus_, darker in the stem.
=Tubes= depressed around the stem, greenish-yellow, their mouths
yellowish-brown. =Stem= small, subbulbous, colored like the pileus.
=Spores= 12–15×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–2.5 in. broad.

Woods. New England, _Frost_.

By the differently-colored tube mouths, this species approaches those of
the next following tribe, but it is placed here because these are not
red or reddish. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. au´ripes= Pk.—yellow-stem. =Pileus= convex, subglabrous,
yellowish-brown, sometimes cracking in areas when old. =Flesh= yellow,
fading to whitish with age. =Tubes= nearly plane, their mouths small,
subrotund, at first stuffed, yellow. =Stem= nearly equal, solid, even or
slightly reticulated at the top, bright yellow, a little paler within.
=Spores= ochraceous-brown tinged with green, 12×5µ.

=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, 8–12 lines thick.

Under mountain laurel, _Kalmia latifolia_. Port Jefferson. July.

The whole plant, except the upper surface of the pileus, is of a
beautiful yellow color. The stem is sometimes more highly colored than
the tubes. The species is referable to the tribe Edules. _Peck_, 50th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. August, September, 1898. _McIlvaine._

In mixed woods in which _Kalmia latifolia_ is plentiful. The specimens
found were in its vicinity. The caps are excellent.


=B. leptoceph´alus= Pk. _Gr_—thin; _Gr_—head. =Pileus= thin, broadly
convex or nearly plane, dry, minutely cracked, especially near the
margin, light tawny-brown, sometimes tinged with reddish-brown. =Flesh=
yellowish-white, taste at first mild, then slightly acrid. =Tubes=
subventricose, depressed about the stem, nearly free, dingy
olive-yellow, the mouths small, subrotund. =Stem= nearly equal, enlarged
at the top, solid, glabrous or slightly pruinose-mealy, reticulated
above, colored like the pileus, white within, with a white mycelium at
the base. =Spores= greenish-olivaceous, fusiform, 12.5–17.5µ long, 5–6µ
broad.

=Pileus= 10–12.5 cm. broad. =Stem= 10–12.5 cm. long, 1.2–1.6 cm. thick.

Dry, open woods. July. _Earle._

The reticulation of the upper part of the stem appears to be formed by
the decurrent walls of the tubes. The species belongs to the tribe
Edules. _Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 25.

Edible.


=B. fra´grans= Vitt.—fragrant. Fasciculate or solitary. =Pileus= 1–4 in.
across, convex, dark-brown or umber-brown, often wavy, slightly
tomentose, margin incurved. =Flesh= very thick, yellowish, sometimes
unchangeable, at others changing to green or blue, and finally becoming
reddish when broken. =Tubes= shortened around the stem and almost free,
½ in. or more long, openings small, roundish, yellow then greenish.
=Stem= at first stout, ovate, usually tapering at the base, then
lengthening and becoming thinner upward, even, variegated with yellow
and red, solid. =Spores= pale-olive, elongato-fusiform, 10–12×4µ.

In woods, under oaks, etc. =Pileus= bronze-brown, sometimes with purple
shades. Often grows in dense clusters, and in this particular differing
from any other British species. Very good for eating. _Massee._

Haddonfield, N.J. Oak woods. August to September, 1894. Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
1898. _McIlvaine._

Solitary. A handsome valuable species which appears to be rare in the
United States. Shade a beautiful bronze. Cap 3–4 in. across. A dozen or
more individuals were found and eaten. Excellent.


=B. frustulo´sus= Pk.—_frustulum_, a small bit. =Pileus= thick, convex
or nearly plane, subglabrous, cracked in areas, white or whitish.
=Flesh= whitish. =Tubes= equal to or a little longer than the thickness
of the flesh of the pileus, depressed about the stem, whitish, becoming
pale brown. =Stem= equal, solid, whitish, reticulated above. =Spores=
15–17×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 6–10 lines thick.

Open grounds and clay banks. Ocean Springs, Mississippi and Akron,
Alabama. May and June. _Underwood._

The deeply cracked surface of the pileus is the most notable feature of
this species. This sometimes is seen even in quite young plants. The
cracked areas are quite unequal in size. The deep chinks with sloping
sides cause them to appear like frusta of polygonal pyramids. In some
specimens the reticulations of the stem extend nearly or quite to its
base, and make the place of the species ambiguous between the Calopodes
and Edules. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 24, No. 3.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., September, 1898, on soil over red conglomerate and on
road-sides. _McIlvaine._

The deep cracks in the cap readily distinguish this species. After rains
the caps are frequently slightly dished and widely cracked at margin.
The exposed flesh dries with a fine silky gloss. The caps are excellent.
The tubes and stem should be removed.


=B. cras´sipes= Pk.—thick-footed. (Plate CXVI, fig. 5, p. 420.) =Pileus=
convex or centrally depressed, firm, dry, velvety, brown tinged with
yellow, the wavy or lobed involute margin extending beyond the tubes.
=Flesh= lemon-yellow, unchangeable, taste sweet, odor like that of
yeast. =Tubes= rather short, depressed around the stem, almost free,
yellowish mottled with brown, the mouths minute, stuffed when young.
=Stem= stout, thick, sometimes swollen in the middle and sometimes
bulbous, beautifully reticulated but the reticulations sometimes
disappearing with age, orange-yellow tinged with brown. =Flesh= of a
brighter yellow than that of the pileus.

=Pileus= 5–10 cm. broad. =Stem= 6–8 cm. long, 2.5–3.5 cm. thick.

Oak woods. Mt. Gretna, Pa. August and September. _McIlvaine._

The thick, beautifully reticulated stem, the deep velvety brown color of
the pileus and the yellow color of the flesh serve to distinguish this
species. _Peck_, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club, Vol. 27, January, 1900.

It is one of the best edible mushrooms. I have also found it in New
Jersey.


                                LU´RIDI.

Stratum of tubes rounded toward the stem and free, their mouths at first
closed and red. =Pileus= compact, then soft, cushion-shaped, the flesh
juicy, changeable. =Stem= stout, at first short, bulbiform, then
elongated and subequal, subreticulated or dotted.

Growing especially in frondose woods. Very poisonous.

In this tribe the tubes and their mouths are differently colored, the
latter being red or some shade of red. By this character the species are
easily distinguished from those of other tribes.

All authors, up to this date, agree in stating that the species within
this series are poisonous. Experiments made by Smiedeberg and Koppe with
Boletus Satanus developed symptoms closely resembling poisoning by
Amanitæ. Kobert, who made analysis of B. luridus, shows that it contains
muscarine, which is one of the most deadly poisons. Such a mass of
evidence commands respect. It is urged upon finders of these species to
either leave them alone or test them in minute quantities until they
have established their ability to eat them without injury.

I have taken special pains to establish the edibility of B. Satanus and
B. luridus. For fifteen years I have eaten them in quantity when
opportunity afforded, in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. My
family, and my friends in widely separated localities, have partaken
freely of them many times and without discomfort. They are remarkably
fine eating. The same can be said of B. alveolatus, B. purpureus, B.
subvelutipes. I have not seen the other species of this tribe.

I have determined so many of the reputed poisonous species to be
edible, that unless positively authenticated, I do not accept repute
as truth, but carefully test suspicious species upon myself. When sure
there is no danger, I as carefully have them tested by my numerous
under-tasters—male and female.


=B. Sa´tanus= Lenz.—Satanic. =Pileus= convex, _glabrous_, somewhat
gluey, _brownish-yellow or whitish_. =Flesh= whitish, becoming _reddish
or violaceous_ where wounded. =Tubes= free, yellow, their mouths bright
red becoming orange-colored with age. =Stem= thick, ovate-ventricose,
marked above with red reticulations. =Spores= 12×5µ.

=Pileus= 3–8 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long.

Woods. Rare. North Carolina, _Curtis_; New York, _Peck_; California, _H.
and M._, _N.J. Ellis_.

Though mild to the taste, this Boletus is said to be very poisonous, a
character suggestive of the specific name. Fries describes the color of
the spores as earthy-yellow; Smith as rich brown. _Peck_, Boleti of the
U.S.

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

Boletus Satanus is sometimes plentiful in spots. Where it luxuriates it
is a rich decoration to the ground, and earth upon upturned-roots upon
which it often grows. It does not live long after reaching maturity, but
decomposes into a putrescent mass.

Its reputation rivals that of the original possessor of its name. But
old proverb sayeth that even “The Devil is not as black as he is
painted.” See remarks heading Luridi.


=B. alveola´tus= B. and C. =Pileus= convex, glabrous, shining, bright
crimson or maroon-color, sometimes paler and varied with patches of
yellow. =Flesh= firm, white, changing to blue where wounded. =Tubes=
_adnate, subdecurrent_, yellow with maroon-colored mouths, the hymenial
surface _uneven with irregular alveolar depressions_. =Stem= very _rough
with the margins of rather coarse subreticular depressions_, the
reticulations bright-red above with yellow stains. =Spores=
yellowish-brown, 12.5–15×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 9 lines thick.

Damp woods. New England, _Frost_. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia mountains, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, in mixed woods and on
banks of streams. _McIlvaine._

B. alveolatus appears to be more generally distributed than B. Satanus.
It is not as clannish, though occasionally three or four are found
growing together. When growing from the banks of creeks, or between the
roots of beech and other trees in low places, it is often deformed in
cap and stem. The texture is firm, close and the taste is very pleasant.
It botanically takes its place in this suspected series. I consider it
one of the best Boleti. See remarks heading Luridi.


=B. lu´ridus= Schaeff.—lurid in color. =Pileus= convex, tomentose,
_brown-olivaceous_, then _somewhat viscose_, sooty. =Flesh= yellow,
changing to blue where wounded. =Tubes= free, yellow, becoming greenish,
their mouths round, vermilion, _becoming orange_. =Stem= stout,
vermilion, somewhat orange at the top, _reticulate or punctate_.
=Spores= greenish-gray, 15×9.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long.

The lurid Boletus, though pleasant to the taste, is reputed very
poisonous. _Boletus rubeolarius_ Pers., having a short bulbous scarcely
reticulated stem, is regarded as a variety of this species. The
red-stemmed Boletus, _B. erythropus_ Pers., is also indicated as a
variety of it by Fries. It is smaller than B. luridus, has a brown or
reddish-brown pileus and a slender cylindrical stem, not reticulated,
but dotted with squamules. It has been reported from California by
Harkness and Moore. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Var. _erythropus_ received from Dr. J.W. Harshberger, Philadelphia, May,
1896.

Often shining as if varnished and very handsome. I frequently found it
in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in mixed woods among
leaves. Its reputation is bad. It is undoubtedly edible by many, and is
delicious. The caution heading Luridi should be carefully observed.


=B. purpu´reus= Fr.—purple. =Pileus= convex, opaque, dry, _somewhat
velvety, purplish-red_. =Flesh= in the young plant only becoming blue,
then dark-yellow. =Tubes= nearly free, yellow or greenish-yellow, their
mouths minute, _purple-orange_, changing to blue where wounded. =Stem=
stout, firm, adorned with purple veins or dots, sometimes reticulated at
the apex only, yellow, reddish within, especially at the base. =Spores=
greenish-brown, 10–12×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 6–8 lines thick.

Woods. North Carolina, _Curtis_; New York, _Peck_; Minnesota, _Johnson_.
_Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia, Mt. Gretna, Pa., _McIlvaine_.

At Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1897–1898, B. purpureus was common in oak and
chestnut woods. It is a showy species, easily distinguished by its
velvety cap. In young specimens the stem is robust, then tapering
upward. When old the cap loses its rich color toward the margin,
becoming yellowish. The flesh is thick, firm and of excellent flavor. It
undoubtedly proved itself delicious and harmless to many eating it.


=B. vermiculo´sus= Pk.—wormy. =Pileus= broadly convex, thick, firm,
_dry_, glabrous, or very minutely tomentose, brown, yellowish-brown or
grayish-brown, sometimes tinged with red. =Flesh= white or whitish,
quickly changing to blue where wounded. =Tubes= plane or slightly
convex, nearly free, yellow, their mouths small, round, brownish-orange,
becoming darker or blackish with age, changing promptly to blue where
wounded. =Stem= subequal, firm, _even_, paler than the pileus. =Spores=
ochraceous-brown, 10–12×4–5µ.

Var. _Spra´guei_. (Boletus Spraguei Frost, Bull. Buff. Soc., p. 102.)
=Stem= yellow above, minutely velvety below.

=Pileus= 3–5 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 4–10 lines thick.

Woods. New York, _Peck_; Ohio, _Morgan_; New England, _Frost_.

The species is separated from B. luridus by its dry pileus, white flesh,
even stem, which is neither reticulated nor dotted, and by its smaller
spores. I can not distinguish specimens of B. Spraguei received from Mr.
Frost, from this species. The name is scarcely appropriate, for
specimens are not always infested by larvæ. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

I have not seen this species, therefore, have not tested it. CAUTION.


=B. subvelu´tipes= Pk.—velvety-stem. =Pileus= convex, firm, subglabrous,
yellowish-brown or reddish-brown. =Flesh= whitish, both it and the tubes
changing to blue where wounded. =Tubes= plane or slightly convex, nearly
free, yellowish, their mouths small, brownish-red. =Stem= equal or
slightly tapering upward, firm, even, somewhat pruinose above, _velvety
with a hairy tomentum toward the base_, yellow at the top, reddish-brown
below, varied with red and yellow within. =Spores= 15–18×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 2–3 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Woods. New York, _Peck_.

This species resembles the preceding one in general appearance, but it
is very distinct by its much longer spores and by the velvety hairiness
toward the base of the stem. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Boletus subvelutipes is common in some localities in Pennsylvania,
especially on the Springton Hills, in chestnut and oak woods. I have
frequently eaten it and found it excellent. Others should carefully test
it.


=B. fir´mus= Frost—firm. =Pileus= convex, _very firm_, slightly
tomentose, gray, often pitted. =Flesh= _yellowish or deep-yellow_,
changing to blue where wounded. =Tubes= _adnate_, deeply arcuate,
unequal, yellow, their mouths _tinged with red_. =Stem= solid, hard,
_very finely reticulated_, yellowish, reddish at the base. =Spores=
13×3µ.

=Pileus= 2.5–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long.

Rich moist wood. New England, _Frost_.

Apparently a well-marked and very distinct species. According to the
author, it is readily distinguished by its tenacity and generally
distorted growth. I have not seen it nor the next. _Peck_, Boleti of the
U.S.

Professor Peck’s measurement of spores, 50th Report, New York State
Botanist, is 13µ long, 6µ wide.


=B. magnis´porus= Frost. =Pileus= convex, firm, tomentose,
_golden-yellow_; tubes _scarcely adnate_, even, greenish-yellow, their
mouths light cinnabar-red. =Stem= long, slender, yellow above, red
below. =Spores= 15–18×6µ.

=B. Fros´tii= Russell. =Pileus= convex, polished, shining, _blood-red_,
the margin thin. =Flesh= scarcely changing to blue. =Tubes= nearly free,
greenish-yellow, becoming yellowish-brown with age, their mouths
blood-red or cinnabar. =Stem= equal or tapering upward, distinctly
reticulated, firm, blood-red. =Spores= 12.5–15×5µ.

=Pileus= 3–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Grassy places under trees or in thin woods. New England, _Frost_; New
York, _Peck_; New Jersey, _Ellis_.

This is a highly colored, beautiful Boletus, but it is not common. The
stem sometimes fades with age, and both it and the tubes are apt to lose
their color in drying. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

I have not recognized it. CAUTION.


=B. Sullivan´tii= B. and M. =Pileus= hemispherical, glabrous,
reddish-tawny or brown, brownish when dry, cracked in squares. =Tubes=
free, convex, medium size, angular, longer toward the margin, their
mouths reddish. =Stem= solid, violaceous at the thickened base,
red-reticulated at the apex, expanded into the pileus. =Spores= pallid
ochraceous, oblong-fusiform, 10–20µ long.

=Pileus= 3–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long.

Compact soil. Ohio. _Sullivant._

The species is said to be intermediate between Boletus scaber and B.
edulis. From the former it differs in its reticulated stem, from the
latter, in its larger tubes and from both in its stratum of tubes being
remote from the stem. I have not seen it. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. Un´derwoodii= Pk. =Pileus= rather thin, convex, becoming nearly
plane, slightly velvety, bright brownish-red, becoming paler with age.
=Flesh= yellow, changing to greenish-blue where wounded. =Tubes= adnate
or slightly decurrent, greenish-yellow, becoming bluish where wounded,
their mouths very small, round, cinnabar red, becoming brownish-orange.
=Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward, somewhat irregular, solid,
yellow without and within. =Spores= 10–12 x 5µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Grassy woods. Auburn, Alabama. July. _Underwood._

This species is remarkable for its adnate or subdecurrent tubes, in
which it departs from the character of the tribe to which it belongs
according to the colors of the tubes. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club,
Vol. 24, No. 3.


=B. par´vus= Pk.—_parvus_, small. =Pileus= convex, becoming plane, often
slightly umbonate, subtomentose, reddish. =Flesh= yellowish-white,
slowly changing to pinkish where wounded. =Tubes= nearly plane, adnate,
their mouths rather large, angular, at first bright red, becoming
reddish-brown. =Stem= equal or slightly thickened below, red. =Spores=
oblong, 12.5×4µ. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 2–3 lines
thick.

Moist woods. Frequent. North Carolina and Pennsylvania, _Schweinitz_.

In Epicrisis, p. 424, Fries adds to the description here quoted, that
the stem is flocculose-veiled. He subjoins to this as a subspecies,
Boletus floccosus Schw.; but in Syn. N.A. Fung., Schweinitz makes this a
synonym of Boletus floccopus. The species does not appear to have been
recognized by recent collectors, which seems strange unless there is
some error concerning it. Can it be a black variety of Boletus scaber?
_Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. Gravelly woods. _McIlvaine._

Cap 1½-4 in. across, convex, slightly depressed, _margin involute when
young_, black, densely velvety in youth and age—beautifully so. =Flesh=
firm, thick, solid, white changing to grayish. =Tubes= white, stuffed,
sometimes blackish when young, excepting a grayish-white circle around
stem, becoming yellowish-white when matured, rotund, minute, up to ½ in.
long, plane when young; when caps expand tubes draw away from stem
leaving a deep white depression. This drawing away apparently elongates
many dissepiments, creating a gill-like effect, decurrent upon stem.
=Stem= 2–3 in. long, swollen toward base when young, equal, expanding
into cap and tapering to a point at base; ¾-1 in. thick, slightly
compressible, hard, sooty-black, velvety near base, satiny and glossy
upward, has the appearance of having been blackened with burnt cork,
usually with narrow white band next to the tubes, no trace of veil,
composed of rather hard waved fibers, white when split, but changing to
sooty black toward base, lighter upward.

Smell like common mushroom; taste nutty.

Gregarious in sandy-conglomerate soil in mixed woods, among moss and
leaves. Mt. Gretna, Pa.

Differs from B. alboater Schw., in having densely tomentose cap, tubes
widely separated from stem in age.

A young specimen of apparently same species in same patch had very
short, decurrent tubes (not over 1 line) which were sooty-black.

Delicious.

Recent excavations in woods. New England, _Frost_; Ohio, _Morgan_.

The Ohio plant occurs in damp woods, has the flesh sometimes tinged with

  BOLETUS SCABER.

=B. sca´ber= Fr.—_scaber_, rough. (Plate CXVIII, fig. 4, p. 436.)
=Pileus= convex, _glabrous, viscid when moist_, at length wrinkled or
lined. =Tubes= free, convex, white, then sordid, their mouths minute,
rotund. =Stem= solid, attenuated above, _roughened with fibrous scales_.
=Spores= oblong-fusiform, snuff-brown, 14–18×4–6µ.

=Pileus= 1–5 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, 3–8 lines thick.

Woods, swamps and open places. Very common and appearing through summer
and autumn.

This may fairly be called our most common and variable species. It is
recorded in nearly every local list of fungi. The pileus is convex,
hemispherical or even subconical. It may be glabrous, minutely
tomentose, subvelvety or squamulose. The flesh is white or whitish and
sometimes slightly changeable where wounded. The tubes are generally
rather long and with a rounded or convex surface. The stem is distinctly
scabrous or roughened with small blackish-brown or reddish dots or
scales, the ground color generally being whitish, grayish or pallid. The
spores have been described as pale-brown and light-yellowish. When
caught in a mass on white paper they appear to me to approach
snuff-brown. The viscidity of the pileus is not always clearly
discernible. Indeed the pileus is often quite as _dry as in_ B.
versipellis. When moistened by heavy rains it sometimes is smooth and
clammy to the touch but scarcely viscid. Several varieties have been
indicated which are expressive of the variations in the color of the
pileus.

Var. _testa´ceus_. =Pileus= brick-red.

Var. _auranti´acus_. =Pileus= orange or orange-red.

These appear to connect this species and B. versipellis.

Var. _aluta´ceus_. =Pileus= yellowish-tan color.

Var. _fuligin´eus_. =Pileus= fuliginous or cinereous-fuliginous.

Var. _fus´cus_. =Pileus= brown or dark-brown.

Var. _oliva´ceus_. =Pileus= olivaceous.

Var. _ni´veus_. =Pileus= white, when old sometimes stained with blue or
livid-blue.

To these might be added:

Var. _areola´tus_. =Pileus= rimose-areolate. (Plate CXVIII, fig. 4, p.
436.)

Var. _mutab´ilis_. =Flesh= changing slightly to brown or pinkish where
wounded.

Var. _graci´lipes_. =Stem= very slender, 2–3 in. long, 2–3 lines thick.
=Pileus= thin, translucent when held toward the light.

This Boletus is classed among the edible species, but it is said to be
less agreeable than B. edulis. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

The numerous varieties with their peculiarities here given by Professor
Peck will enable the finder of a Boletus with a distinctly scabrous
stem—_roughened with scales, not reticulate_—to select its name. For the
mycophagist it is enough to know that he has Boletus scaber. In all of
its varieties it is edible. The stems, often the tubes, unless young,
should be discarded, as they do not cook in the same time as the caps.
The comparative excellence of the species rests with the devourer. It
deserves a high place.

B. scaber, var. areolatus, Plate CXVIII, fig. 4, has slight flavor, but
is of pleasing consistency.


=B. durius´culus= Schulz—somewhat hard. =Pileus= 2–5 in. across,
hemispherical, minutely velvety, viscid when moist, varying in color
from pale-brown, through dingy-chestnut, to umber-brown, often becoming
cracked in areas when dry, interstices paler. =Flesh= thick, white or
tinged yellow, when cut becoming reddish copper-color. =Tubes= ½-¾ in.
long, shortened round the stem and free, openings about ⅔ mm. across,
often compound, irregularly angular, bright-yellow. =Stem= 4–7 in. long,
fusiform, thickest part 1½-2 in. across, situated below the middle,
yellowish, rough with blackish points, which are sometimes arranged in a
subreticulate manner, apex sometimes more or less grooved, solid, flesh
of upper part becoming coppery like the pileus. =Spores=
elongato-cylindrical, pale-umber, 14–16×5–6µ.

In woods. Esculent and very delicious. Allied to Boletus scaber, but
distinguished by the bright-yellow tubes and the very firm flesh, which
turns coppery-red when exposed to the air; this color eventually changes
to a dingy grayish-violet. Also allied to Boletus porphyrosporus.
_Massee._

Snow Hill, N.J. Gravelly soil, mixed woods, 1892. _McIlvaine._

The stem and tubes should be removed. The caps are very fine.


=B. albel´lus= Pk.—whitish. =Pileus= convex or gibbous, soft, glabrous,
whitish. =Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Tubes= convex, free, or nearly
so, small, subrotund, whitish, unchangeable. =Stem= _glabrous or
minutely branny_, substriate, _bulbous or thickened at the base_,
whitish. =Spores= brownish-ochraceous, 14–16×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long, 3–6 lines thick.

Woods. New York, _Peck_.

This is closely related to B. scaber, of which it may possibly prove to
be a dwarf form; but it is easily distinguished by its smooth or only
slightly scurfy and subbulbous stem. It presents no appearance of the
colored dot-like squamules which are a constant and characteristic
feature of that species. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia. Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia. _McIlvaine._

Specimens found at Mt. Gretna, Pa., had a satiny, glossy stem,
beautifully furfuraceous, and stem _not_ thickened at base. Professor
Peck, to whom specimens were sent, writes: “Stem is a little more
furfuraceous, and not thickened at the base, otherwise the agreement is
very good.” It is good fried.


=B. chro´mapes= Frost. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane, slightly and
sometimes fasciculately tomentose, pale-red. =Flesh= white,
unchangeable. =Tubes= subadnate, more or less depressed around the stem,
white or whitish, becoming brown. =Stem= equal or slightly tapering
upward, _rough-spotted_, whitish or pallid, _chrome-yellow at the base
both without and within_, sometimes reddish above. =Spores= oblong,
12–14×4–5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Woods. New England, _Frost_; New York, _Peck_.

The yellow base of the stem appears to be a peculiar and constant
character by which the species may easily be recognized. It imitates
Boletus piperatus in this respect, but in everything else it is very
distinct from that plant. Sometimes the stem is so badly infested by
larvæ that it is difficult to procure a sound specimen. The spores have
a subferruginous color with a slight incarnate tint, but the
rough-dotted stem indicates a relationship with B. scaber. Through this
species, Boletus conicus and B. gracilis, the Versipelles and the
Hyporhodii appear to run together. In the Catalogue of Plants of Amherst
the specific name is “chromapus.” It would be more in accordance with
present custom to write it “chromopus.” _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

A dozen or more specimens referable to this species were found by me at
Mt. Gretna, Pa., August, 1897, in mixed woods. The caps were eaten and
were excellent.


=B. nebulo´sus= Pk. =Pileus= convex, dry, snuff-brown or smoky-brown.
=Flesh= white, unchangeable. =Tubes= convex, depressed around the stem,
pallid or brownish, becoming purplish-brown where wounded, the mouths
small, rotund. =Stem= enlarged toward the base, solid, scurfy, colored
like the pileus. =Spores= 12.5–15×6µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Shaded banks by road-side. Raybrook. August.

No young or immature specimens were seen, and the description is to that
extent incomplete. _Peck_, 51st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

By a painting made by the writer September, 1885, Professor Peck
identified the species of which it is a picture as B. nebulosus Pk. The
following notes accompany it, which have been verified many times since
their writing:

Oak woods. West Philadelphia, Pa., September. Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
September.

=Pileus= chestnut-brown and darker, covered with small, low, black
spots; convex, often depressed in center, sharp on margin. =Flesh=
white, thick, solid, unchangeable. =Tubes= very small, and light
pinkish-brown. When touched they change to a deeper hue. =Stem= same
color as pileus, but a shade lighter, solid, scurfy, having a striate
appearance, enlarging toward base.

Taste sweet and pleasant. Cooked it is juicy, meaty and very fine.


=B. ful´vus Pk=.—brownish-yellow. (Plate CXVI, fig. 3, p. 420.) =Pileus=
thick, convex or subcampanulate, dry, glabrous, rimose-areolate,
tawny-yellow, the extreme margin dark-brown. =Flesh= spongy, tough,
white, slowly assuming a reddish tint upon exposure to the air. =Tubes=
rather long, ventricose, depressed around the stem and free or nearly
so, greenish-yellow, the mouths small, tawny-yellow. =Stem= rather long,
often narrowed and striate at the top, dotted with brownish-orange
granules or points, radicating, tough, stuffed with greenish-yellow
fibers, colored like the pileus. =Spores= unknown.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 4–5 in. long, 4–8 lines thick.

Cespitose on decaying stumps. West Philadelphia, Pa. August.
_McIlvaine._

Mr. McIlvaine says that there were between twenty and thirty specimens
on and about an old stump and that they were as attractive to the eye as
a cluster of Clitocybe illudens. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol.
27, January, 1900.

Excellent in flavor, rather spongy, but fine.

HYPORHO´DII. _Gr_—somewhat rose-colored.

=Tubes= adnate to the stem, whitish, then white-incarnate from the rosy
spores.

In this tribe the tubes are at first whitish, but with the development
of the spores they usually assume a pinkish or flesh-colored hue. Wounds
of the tubes in some species cause a change in color but not to blue,
nor are the tube mouths differently colored as in the Luridi. The stem
in some is more or less reticulated but this is scarcely a constant or
reliable character in these species. Typically the spores are rosy or
flesh-colored, but I have admitted species in which they incline to
rust-colored, giving more weight to the color of the tubes than to that
of the spores.

=B. con´icus= Rav.—conical. =Pileus= convex or _subconical_, clothed
with bundled appressed _yellowish flocci_. =Flesh= white, unchangeable,
tasteless. =Tubes= ventricose, flesh-colored, becoming darker from the
spores, the mouths small, angular, slightly fringed. =Stem= glabrous,
tapering upward, pale-yellow. =Spores= fusiform, subferruginous.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 2 in. long, 6 lines thick.

Damp pine woods. South Carolina, _Ravenel_.

The species is compared to Boletus scaber, from which it differs in its
smaller tubes and smooth stem, and from both this and B. albellus it
differs in the color of the tubes and in the yellowish flocci of the
pileus. I have seen no specimens, but on account of the color of the
tubes I have placed the species with the Hyporhodii. _Peck_, Boleti of
the U.S.


=B. gra´cilis= Pk.—slender. (Plate CXIV, fig. 1, p. 414.) =Pileus=
convex, glabrous or minutely tomentose, rarely squamulose,
ochraceous-brown, tawny-brown or reddish-brown. =Flesh= white. =Tubes=
plane or convex, depressed around the stem, nearly free, whitish,
becoming pale flesh-colored, their mouths subrotund. =Stem= _long,
slender_, equal or slightly tapering upward, pruinose or minutely
branny, even or marked by slender elevated anastomosing lines which form
long narrow reticulations. =Spores= subferruginous, 12.5–17.5×5–6µ.

Var. _l[oe]´vipes_. =Stem= even.

=Pileus= 1–2 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, 2–4 lines thick.

Woods. New York, _Peck_; New England, _Frost_; Ohio, _Morgan_.

The slender habit separates this species from all the others here
included in this tribe. Its spores are not a clear incarnate in color,
but incline to dull-ferruginous, and by this character this and the
preceding species connect this tribe with Versipelles. In color B.
gracilis resembles some forms of B. felleus, but in size, habit and
color of spores it is easily distinct. The tomentum of the pileus
sometimes breaks into tufts or squamules. This is Boletus vinaceus,
Frost MS. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

B. gracilis, var. lævipes, was found by the writer in Woodland Cemetery,
West Philadelphia, August, 1897, and at Mt. Gretna, Pa., September,
1898. The stem of some specimens spreads at the top. The pileus is often
cracked on the margin, and the upturning of the margin often exposes the
tubes. Painting, as of this species, identified by Professor Peck.

The taste is at first sweet, then bitter. The bitterness is lost in
cooking. Edible, good.


=B. indeci´sus= Pk.—undecided. (Plate CXXII, fig. 1, p. 468.) =Pileus=
convex or nearly plane, dry, slightly tomentose, ochraceous-brown, often
wavy or irregular on the margin. =Flesh= white, unchangeable; taste
mild. =Tubes= nearly plane or convex, _adnate_, grayish becoming tinged
with flesh color when mature, changing to brownish where wounded, their
mouths small, subrotund. =Stem= minutely furfuraceous, straight, or
flexuous, _reticulated above_, pallid without and within. =Spores=
oblong, _brownish flesh color_, 12.5–15×4µ.

=Pileus= 3–4 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 4–6 lines thick.

Thin oak woods. New York, _Peck_.

The mild taste and darker colored spores will separate this Boletus from
any form of B. felleus. Its stem reticulated above distinguishes it from
B. alutarius. It resembles B. modestus in some respects, but its tubes
are not at all yellow. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Kentucky, _Lloyd_, Rep. 4.

Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia, July, 1897, _McIlvaine_; Trenton, N.J.,
August, 1897, _Sterling_. In open mixed woods.

Boletus indecisus so closely resembles B. felleus in some of its forms
that until the color of the spores is ascertained, the sweet taste,
without trace of bitter, is the only thing that will enable the finder
to discriminate between them. Young B. felleus are at first pleasant to
the taste and do not, at once, develop their intense bitter in the
mouth. They may readily be taken for B. indecisus. If, by mistake, a
single B. felleus is cooked with mild species, the dish will be spoiled.
Specimens believed to be B. indecisus should be tested. A minute will
perfectly satisfy anyone.

The B. indecisus is delicious.

Common in West Virginia mountains where it grows with B. felleus, from
which it is impossible to distinguish it without tasting. It is
delicious when cooked. But I long ago ceased collecting for the table
any Boletus questionable for B. felleus. I have been deceived so many
times—taken the bitter for the sweet—that, preferring the sweet, I take
no chances for the bitter.


=B. fel´leus= Bull.—_fel_, gall. Bitter. (Plate CXXII, fig. 2, 3, 4, p.
468.) =Pileus= convex or nearly plane, firm, becoming soft, _glabrous_,
even, variable in color, pale-yellowish, grayish-brown, yellowish-brown,
reddish-brown or chestnut. =Flesh= white, often changing to flesh color
where wounded, taste _bitter_. =Tubes= adnate, long, convex, depressed
around the stem, their mouths angular, white, becoming tinged with
flesh-color. =Stem= variable, equal or tapering upward, short or long,
sometimes bulbous or enlarged at the base, subglabrous, generally
reticulated above, colored like or a little paler than the pileus.
=Spores= oblong-fusiform, flesh-colored, 12.5–17.5×4–5µ.

Var. _obe´sus_. =Pileus= large. =Stem= thick, coarsely and distinctly
reticulated nearly or quite to the base.

=Pileus= 3–8 in. broad. =Stem= 2–4 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.

The variety is large and solitary in its mode of growth. It is
remarkable for the coarse reticulations of the stem which extend nearly
or quite to the base. After heavy rains the pileus is viscid. It may
prove to be a distinct species.

The flesh in the American plant does not always assume incarnate hues
where wounded. The color of the fresh tubes often changes to a deeper
tint where wounded. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, _McIlvaine_;
Indiana, _H.I. Miller_.

A very common species in woods and on thin margins, on open grassy
places, and about decayed stumps. I saw hundreds of plants, var. obesus,
some a foot in diameter, in a wheat stubble near oak woods.

One of the most attractive of Boleti. Its cap resembles a handsomely
browned cake. Its solidity is inviting; its flesh, generous in quantity,
excites appetite. Until one experiences its intense lasting bitter, one
clings to it with hope. Even after tasting, it is thrown away with
regret. It is not poisonous, but a small piece of one will embitter a
whole dish. _McIlvaine_, Bull. Phila. Myc. Center. July, 1898.


=B. nigrel´lus= Pk.—blackish. =Pileus= broadly convex or nearly plane,
dry, subglabrous, _blackish_. =Flesh= soft, white, unchangeable. =Tubes=
plane or convex, adnate, sometimes slightly depressed around the stem,
their mouths small, subrotund, whitish becoming flesh-colored, slowly
changing to _brown or blackish where wounded_. =Stem= equal, short,
_even_, colored like or a little paler than the pileus. =Spores= dull
flesh-colored, 10–12×5–6µ.

=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–2.5 in. long, 6–12 lines thick.

Woods and copses. New York, _Peck_.

The blackish color of the pileus and stem distinguishes this species.
From Boletus alboater Schw., the adnate, flesh-colored tubes will
separate it. The surface of the pileus sometimes becomes cracked in
areas. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., August, 1898. _McIlvaine._

Another distinguishing mark from B. alboater is the velvety pileus of
the latter. B. nigrellus is mild in taste and smell and an excellent
species for the table.


=B. eccen´tricus= Pk.—eccentric. (Plate CXVI, fig. 1, p. 420.) =Pileus=
thick, firm, convex, irregular, glabrous, more or less lobed or wavy on
the involute margin, gray or yellowish-gray. =Flesh= white,
close-grained, elastic, unchangeable, taste and odor farinaceous.
=Tubes= convex, depressed around the stem, not reaching the margin of
the pileus, somewhat uneven and pitted on the surface, yellowish-brown,
the mouths subangular, at first concolorous, becoming reddish or
reddish-purple. =Stem= eccentric, tapering downward, solid, uneven with
short irregular shallow grooves or obscure reticulations, tinged with
red at the top, grayish below, tinged with red or purple within at the
base.

=Pileus= 5–10 cm. broad. =Stem= 4–5 cm. long, 3–4 cm. thick at the top.

Sandy soil in grassy places in woods. Mt. Gretna, Pa. August and
September.

The species is well marked by its eccentric stem, thick irregular pileus
and the reddish or reddish-purple mouths of the mature tubes. Mr.
McIlvaine remarks that when it is cooked it is delicate and savory.
_Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, No. 27.

In commenting upon this new species to the writer, Professor Peck says:
“I suspect that the spores of this (B. eccentricus) are pinkish or rosy.
If so, it belongs here (in Hyporhodii). If not, it may have to go in the
Luridi, or possibly may be made the type of a new tribe.”


                     CARIO´SI—_caries_, rottenness.

Stem never reticulated, stuffed with a spongy pith, at length commonly
excavated. Tubes at first white, then often yellowish, their mouths
minute, round.

Fries adds to these characters, “spores white.” But in our species the
spores are pale-yellow when shed in a mass on white paper. They are more
elliptical in outline than the spores of most Boleti. The character of
the stem is peculiar and easily distinguishes the tribe. The exterior is
firm, the interior soft and spongy, becoming irregularly hollow or
cavernous in the typical species.

=B. cyanes´cens= Bull.—_cyaneus_, deep-blue. =Pileus= convex or nearly

pale-buff, grayish-yellow, yellowish or somewhat brown. =Flesh= rigid,
white, _quickly changing to blue_ where wounded. =Tubes= free, white,

Boletus cyanescens is a sparse grower. The quality of the juice varies.
That of young specimens stains the fingers blue, that of old, brown. The
caps are firm and make an excellent dish cooked in any way.


=B. casta´neus= Bull.—chestnut. (Plate CXIV, fig. 3, p. 414.) =Pileus=
convex, nearly plane or depressed, firm, even, dry, minutely
_velvety-tomentose, cinnamon or reddish-brown_. =Flesh= white,
unchangeable. =Tubes= free, short, small, white becoming yellow. =Stem=
equal or tapering upward, even, stuffed or hollow, clothed and colored
like the pileus. =Spores= 10–12.5×6–7.5µ.

=Pileus= 1.5–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2.5 in. long, 3–5 lines thick.

Woods and open places. Rather common and wide spread. _Peck_, Boleti of
the U.S.

Boletus castaneus is one of the neatest looking of fungi. The prevailing
color is cinnamon, that of the tubes white or very light yellow, spotted
with brown wherever insects have touched them. The pore surface of
mature specimens is usually irregular. Whoever has seen the stalagmites
of Luray Cave will recognize their color on the stems of B. castaneus.
These are brittle, snapping like pipe stems, with a small tube in
center.

The fungus is common from June until September. It is gregarious,
occasionally three or four individuals form a group. Either raw or
cooked the caps are edible and will become favorites.


=B. Mur´rayi= B. and C. =Pileus= hemispherical, _granulated, vivid red_.
=Flesh= yellow. =Tubes= decurrent, about 1 line deep, yellow. =Stem=
clavate, even, pale-yellow. =Spores= pale-yellow.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. broad, nearly 1.5 thick.

New England, _Murray_.

On account of the color of the spores this species has been placed with
the Cariosi. The description does not mention the character of the
interior of the stem, and the decurrent tubes depart from the character
of the typical species so that its true position is uncertain. The
species seems well marked by the character of the pileus. _Peck_, Boleti
of the U.S.


=B. isabelli´nus= Pk. =Pileus= convex, firm, minutely tomentose,
whitish, becoming darker and smoother with age. =Flesh= isabelline.
=Tubes= adnate, minute, sometimes larger near the stem, nearly round,
whitish. =Stem= nearly equal, subglabrous, hollow, whitish. =Spores=
subelliptical, 7.5–9×5–6µ. =Pileus= 2–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1–2 in. long,
4–6 lines thick.

Woods. Ocean Springs, Miss. June. _Underwood._

The species belongs to the Cariosi. _Peck_, in Bull. Torrey Bot. Club,

                          APPENDIX (Boletus).

The descriptions of the following species are scarcely sufficient to
permit of the satisfactory reference of the species to their places in
the tribes. It is to be hoped that these plants may again be found and
their proper relations be ascertained.


=B. Ana´nas= Curt. =Pileus= pulvinate, thickly and rigidly
floccose-verrucose, yellow, flocci white above, flesh-colored beneath,
the margin thin, membranous, lacerated; hymenium plane, depressed around
the stem, yellow or tawny-yellow, becoming greenish where wounded, their
mouths medium size, obtusely angular. =Stem= even, solid, somewhat
enlarged at the base, white. =Spores= ferruginous.

=Pileus= 3–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 6–9 lines thick.

Under prostrate trunks of pine trees.

South Carolina, _Ravenel_; North Carolina, _Curtis_.

This is said to approach S. strobilaceus in habitat, but to be otherwise
very different. It is placed among the Subtomentosi in Sylloge, but from
these it recedes by its floccose wart-like scales. _Peck_, Boleti of the
U.S.


=B. radico´sus= Bundy. =Pileus= thin, wide, recurved, yellow tinged with
brown, the cuticle easily removed. =Flesh= pale-yellowish tinged with
pink, not changing color when bruised. =Tubes= decurrent, large,
uneven-mouthed, compound, angular, tinged with brown. =Stem= flexuous,
yellow above, whitish below, rough with dark appressed scales,
fibrous-rooted.

=Pileus= 4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–4 in. long, 5 lines thick.

Wisconsin, _Bundy_.

The pileus is not described as viscid, but in other respects the species
appears to belong to the Viscipelles and to be related to Boletus
collinitus. _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=B. Po´cono= Schw. =Pileus= pulvinate, cervine (dun color), minutely
covered with bundles of tomentum on the closely-inflexed margin. =Tubes=
rather large, somewhat prominently angular, concolorous. =Stem=
subattenuated, thickened toward the base, pallid-striate at the apex,
elsewhere spadiceous, subfurfuraceous.

=Pileus= 1 in. broad. Stem 2–3 in. long.

Fung., Vol. VI, p. 49.

I have given Professor Saccardo’s emended diagnosis of this genus,
because it expresses what appears to me to be the most important generic
character, that is, tubes not easily separable from the hymenophore. By
this character and by the tough substance the transition between Boletus
and Polyporus is made.

          Tubes nearly equal in length        S. strobilaceus
          Tubes shortened around the stem        S. floccopus
          _Peck_, Boleti of the U.S.


=S. strobila´ceus= Berk. _Gr_—cone-like. (Plate CXXIV.) =Pileus=
hemispherical or convex, dry, covered with thick floccose projecting
blackish or blackish-brown scales, the margin somewhat appendiculate
with scales and fragments of the veil. =Flesh= whitish, changing to
reddish and then to blackish where wounded. =Tubes= adnate, whitish,
becoming brown or blackish with age; their mouths large, angular,
changing color like the flesh. =Stem= equal or tapering upward, sulcate
at the top, floccose-tomentose, colored like the pileus. =Spores=
subglobose, rough, blackish-brown, 10–12.5µ.

=Pileus= 2–4 in. broad. =Stem= 3–5 in. long, 4–10 lines thick. _Peck_,
Boleti of the U.S.

West Virginia mountains, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_; Indiana, _H.I.
Miller_.

Common in woods and their margins, under the overhanging sods of washes
and road-cuts. Often in troops, occasionally cespitose. The rough fuzzy
cap reminds of short fur that has been wet and dried. Its appearance is
unique among Boleti. Before cooking the stem and tubes should be
removed, unless the latter are very firm and fresh. The squamules must
be cut away or the dish will be rough.

With many this Boletus is a prime favorite. It has a strong woody taste,
sometimes musky, sometimes faintly of anisette. It cooks well by any
method.


=S. floc´copus= Vahl.—floccose-stemmed. =Pileus= convex, soft, covered
with areas of bunched rough, scaly tomentum, cinereous, at length
blackish, appendiculate with the silky, thick annular veil. =Tubes=
_shortened behind_, their mouths large, whitish-gray. =Stem= stout,
pitted above, umber-tomentose below. =Spores= perfectly globose, brown,
9µ broad.

=Pileus= 4–5 in. broad. =Stem= 4–5 in. long, 1 in. thick.

Woods. North Carolina and Pennsylvania, _Schweinitz_; Ohio, _Morgan_;
New York, _Peck_.

According to Fries this is a larger and firmer species than S.
strobilaceus but manifestly related to it. The New York specimens which
I have referred to it differ from S. strobilaceus in no respect, except
in the tubes being depressed around the stem. Unless there are other
differences in the European plant, it scarcely seems to me to be worthy
of specific distinction. Boletus floccopus, Rost. tab. 40, is referred
to Boletus scaber, as is B. holopus, Rost. tab. 48. _Peck_, Boleti of
the U.S.

I agree with Professor Peck that this species is not worthy of specific
distinction. During 1898 I found a bunch containing eight individuals
which varied through all botanic characteristics given to both species.
The largest individual was 4½ in. across cap, the smallest 1½ in. On
some the tubes were adnate, on others shortened behind. There was no
difference in flavor excepting that due to age.

                           _Fistula_, a pipe.


Hymenium formed on the under surface of a fleshy hymenophore, at first
warted, the warts developing into cylindrical tubes that remain distinct
and free from each other, producing in their interior cellular processes
each bearing four spores. Conidia are produced in cavities of the old
hymenophore.

With the outward appearance of a Polyporus, but separated by the tubes
being free from each other.

A small genus of which F. hepatica is the principal species. This is
known and valued in Europe and wherever found in this country.
Unfortunately it is rare or unknown in many localities. A new species
has recently been found in the United States—Fistulina firma, by Mrs. A.
M. Hadley, Manchester, N.H.—a white-flesh species whose edibility is not
reported. Torrey Bull., 1899. F. pallida B. and Rav.; F. radicata,
Schw.; F. spathulata B. and C., are reported from Alabama. Edible
qualities not stated. The writer has not seen them or he surely would
have tested them. The spread and cultivation of F. hepatica is possible.
Experiments in this line are desirable.


=F. hepat´ica= (Huds.) Fr. _Gr_—resembling the liver. (Plate CXXV, fig.
1, p. 476.) Juicy-fleshy, not rooting. =Pileus= entire, blood-red.
=Flesh= thick, soft, viscid above, transversed with tenacious fibers,
hence variegated-red. =Tubes= at first pallid.

Changeable in form, sessile or extended into a lateral stem. _Fries._

=Spores= salmon-color, nearly round with an oblique apiculus, 3µ
_W.G.S._; broadly elliptical, 5–6×3–4µ; conidia, 6–10×5µ _Massee_;
yellowish, elliptical, 5–6.5µ long _Peck_.

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. August to frost. _McIlvaine._

Small specimens may be confounded with F. pallida, which follows.

Fistulina hepatica is celebrated in most countries, and known usually as
the Beefsteak fungus. It grows from decaying crevices in oak, chestnut
and other trees and stumps, but those named are its favorites. July,
August, September are its months, and after rains. In some localities
and years it is rare. At Mt. Gretna, in 1898, a hundred pounds of it
could be gathered almost any day.

August, 1899, at Mt. Gretna, Pa., I found several specimens in vicinity
which, though evidently F. hepatica, were remarkable for their
structure—2–4 in. across, irregularly cylindrical, with spore surface
covering the entire fungus. Stem curt, eccentric, almost central.
Specimens were sent Professor Peck, who writes:

“The sample of Fistulina which you send is a singular thing. Saccardo
has noted a somewhat similar form but without pore surface. Yours has
pore surface, but I do not find spores developed in it. I am inclined to
think it a monstrosity, as you do, but as you say you have found several
of them I think it would be well to put it on record and I will enter it
in my record as Fistulina hepatica monstrosa n. var. and indicate its
characters.” Letter from Professor Peck, August 28, 1899.

I have partially succeeded in transplanting the mycelium of F. hepatica.
Experiments in this direction, I feel confident, will introduce this
valuable fungus to localities where it is not now found, or is rare.
Experiments with the spores have not been as yet successful.


=F. hepatica monstrosa= n. var. Pk. Subglobose, supported on a short
stem or stem-like base, the external surface entirely covered with
tubules 2–4 mm. long.

Pennsylvania. _C. McIlvaine._ In color and texture resembling the common
form, but Mr. McIlvaine informs me that there is nothing in the position
or place of growth of the specimens to account for their peculiar
character. They are 2–4 in. in diameter. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club,
27, January, 1900.

Excellent.


=F. pal´lida= B. and Rav.—_pallidus_, pale. =Pileus= kidney-shaped,
pallid-red, pulverulent, 1–2 in. broad, about 1 in. long, margin
inflexed. =Tubes= more or less decurrent. =Stem= lateral, striate, when
dry, 1½ in. long, ⅓ in. thick.

                      _Gr_—many; a passage, pore.


=Pileus= fleshy, moist, tough, becoming harder in age, internally
composed of radiating fibers; the spore-bearing surface is within
passages or pores which are made by the descending substance of the
pileus forming the dissepiments or separating walls, hence they are not
easily separable from the pileus or from one another. The pores not
appearing at first, then becoming rounded, angular or torn. They form a
distinct strata. =Stem= central, eccentric, lateral or absent.

With few exceptions growing from wood. Section Merisma contains species
which are conspicuous among fungi for their size and beauty.

The majority of this genus are unedible, because of their being woody,
tough or bitter. Few of the edible species are of the first class.

Excellent dishes are made by stewing the species well, serving them in
patties or in croquettes. The cooking of P. intybaceus is a guide to
all.

This species does not seem to be common in America, but is found
throughout Europe. It varies in size from 3 in. to over 3 feet. It has
been known to attain the circumference of 7 ft. 5 in., and the weight of
40 lbs. Dr. Badham says that it can not be masticated and that its
expressed juice is very disagreeable. The fact, however, remains that it
is eaten, and is recorded as edible by most authors. It is undoubtedly
tough, but cut fine and stewed slowly for half an hour it is quite as
tender as the muscle of an oyster and has a pleasant flavor.


=P. pi´cipes= Fr.—_pix_, pitch; _pes_, a foot. Pallid then chestnut,
commonly pale yellowish-livid, with the disk chestnut. =Pileus=
fleshy-coriaceous, then rigid, tough, even, smooth, depressed at the
disk or behind. =Flesh= white. =Stem= excentric and lateral, equal,
firm, at first velvety, then naked, dotted, black up to the pores.
=Pores= decurrent, round, very small, rather slender, white, then
slightly pale yellowish. _Fries._

Imbricated, odor somewhat sweet. The pileus is depressed behind,
commonly emarginate, funnel-shaped with lobes all round.

On trunks, especially willow. Frequent. July to December. _Stevenson._

Many young plants, in tufts upon a decaying oak log, were found by me at
Mt. Gretna, August, 1899. They were oyster-color, the very thin caps
translucent, 2–6 in. across, 1⁄16 in. thick; pores not visible to the
naked eye. The black dots upon the stems developed some time after
gathering.

They were pleasantly crisp when stewed and of fine flavor. Older
specimens were bitter and tough.


                             III.—MERISMA.


=P. umbella´tus= Fr.—_umbella_, a sun-shade. Very much branched,
fibrous-fleshy, toughish. =Pileoli= very numerous, ½-1½ in. broad,
sooty, dull-red or pallid light-yellow, _entire, umbilicate_. =Stems=
elongated, separate, united at the base, white. =Pores= minute, white.

The pileoli have occurred white. _Fries._

Tufts dense, branches spreading from a center. The pilei up to 2 in.
across, connected at base. The dense spreading tufts, up to a foot
across and half as high, are very noticeable. The flesh is soft and of
good flavor. Cook like P. intybaceus.


=P. a´nax= Berk. Fleshy, fibrous, rather tough, dusky-gray, branching
out from a thick, single stem at the base and forming a large head of
branches and pileoli 10–20 lines in diameter; the branches terminate in
numerous large pileoli of various forms and size, imbricating, confluent
and recurved. =Flesh= and =pores= white. =Stems= thick, growing
together, white. =Pores= large, unequal, angular, white. =Spores= white,
subelliptic, 7–8µ long.

Ohio, at the base of oak trees and stumps. Autumn. _Morgan._

This species has apparently been confused by some American mycologists
with P. intybaceus. I have received specimens of it bearing that name.
The spores of that species are described as elliptic or ovoid. The
spores of Polyporus anax, as shown by our specimens, are globose.

Tufts up to 12 in. across; the branches very numerous, up to 2 in. wide.
The plant is tender when young and grows tough as it matures. When young
it is of good flavor and edible—older it makes a well-flavored gravy, or
is edible if chopped fine and very well cooked.


(Plate CXXIX.)

[Illustration: POLYPORUS INTYBACEUS.]

=P. intyba´ceus= Fr.—succory-like. Very much branched, fleshy, somewhat
fragile. =Pileoli= _very numerous_, pale-yellowish inclining to fuscous,
_dimidiate, stretched out_, sinuate, at length spathulate. =Stems=
connate in a very short trunk. =Pores= _firm, obtuse_, white, inclining
to dingy-brown. _Fries._

Edible. _Stevenson._ Paulet says: In place of its being heavy upon the
stomach, _he_ will feel all the lighter who sups upon it.

The people of the Vosges call it the Hen-of-the-Woods.

The words of the old song—

                      “So very much depends upon
                      The way in which it’s done,”

apply with exceptional force to the cooking of P. intybaceus. If it is
cut in thin slices across the grain and slowly stewed for half an hour
it will be tender and of good flavor. It can then be served in that way,
or made into patties or croquettes.


=P. crista´tus= Fr.—_crista_, a crest. Branched, firmly fleshy, fragile.
=Pileoli= about 3 in. broad, _reddish-green_, entire and dimidiate,
imbricated, _depressed, somewhat pulverulent-villous, then cracked into
scales_. =Stems= connate, irregularly shaped, white. =Pores= minute,
angular and torn, whitish. _Fries._

_McIlvaine._

Variable in form, but usually in rose-shaped clusters, which are
slightly greenish at times; oftener shades of yellow. The substance is
the same in texture as P. intybaceus. Cook in same manner.


=P. con´fluens= Fr.—stems confluent; adherent. =Pilei= branched, fleshy,
fragile, thick, dimidiate, imbricated, confluent, smooth, fleshy-yellow
becoming obscure, slightly scaly. =Stem= short. =Pores= short, minute,
pallid-white.

Eaten about Nice; savor a little sharp. _Cordier_; North Carolina,
superior eating. _Curtis._ Pine woods. New Scotland. September.

Our specimens are not at all squamulose, and this character is not
attributed to the species by all authors. It is probable that it is not
uniform in this respect. _Peck_, 39th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=P. Berk´eleyi= Fr. Very much branched. =Pileoli= very large, subzonate,
finally tomentose, yellowish, fleshy, tough becoming corky and hard.
=Stem= short or none, arising from a long and thick common base growing
out of the ground usually near trees or stumps. =Pores= rather large,
irregular, angular, pale yellowish.

A magnificent specimen found near Boston a dozen years ago and exhibited
in the window of Doyle, the florist, was fully four feet high and from
two to three feet broad, containing very many pileoli.

North Carolina, edible, _Curtis_; Iowa, _Bessey_; Ohio, _Morgan_; Mt.
Gretna, Pa., very large specimens, 20 in. across. _McIlvaine._

Edible when young.


=P. gigante´us= Fr.—_gigas_, a giant. Tuft 1–2 ft. and more broad, in
many imbricated layers, fleshy-pliant then somewhat coriaceous. =Pilei=
_date-brown_, dimidiate, very broad, flaccid, somewhat zoned, rivulose,
depressed behind. =Stems= connato-branched from a common tuber. =Pores=
_minute, somewhat round, pallid_, at length torn.

The rigid cuticle separates into granules or fibrillose squamules. Pores
becoming dark when touched. _Fries._

Edible, _Curtis_. Esculent when young. On the continent its esculent
qualities are known and appreciated. _Cooke._

West Virginia, Chester county, Pa., Eagle’s Mere, Pa. On decaying stumps
and roots. _McIlvaine._

It is well marked by its spore-surface becoming black to the touch. When
young and fresh it stews to a pleasant, edible consistency, but is tough
if not well cooked or too old. The flavor of a gravy from it is at all
times good.


=P. sulphu´reus= Fr.—_sulphur_, brimstone. (Plate CXXV, fig. 2, p. 476.)
In many cespitose layers, 1–2 ft. and more, _juicy-cheesy_. =Pilei= 8
in. or more broad, _reddish-yellow_, imbricated, undulated, rather
smooth. =Flesh= light yellowish, then white, splitting open and not
hardened when old. =Pores= minute, plane, _sulphur-yellow_. _Fries._

Soon becoming pale. Commonly sessile, but varying with a stem, lateral
on standing trees, but expanded on all sides on fallen ones; also
club-shaped, porous throughout. _Sow._ In its fullest vigor it is filled
with sulphur-yellow milk.

On living trees and stumps. Frequent. August to October. _Stevenson._

=Spores= oval, white, minutely papillose, 8×5µ _W.G.S._; elliptical,
hyaline, slightly papillose, 7–8×4–5µ _Massee_.

Edible. _Stevenson_, _Curtis_.

Maryland, _Miss Banning_; Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; West Virginia, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania. On willow, apple, cherry, maple, hickory, etc.
Frequent. August to November. _McIlvaine._

Frequently in large masses. Commonly broadly attached, but sometimes
with a short stem. Very occasionally a single pileus will protrude from
a tree like a giant yellow tongue shaded with reddish-orange. Usually
the pilei are in clusters united in a solid base, white-fleshed and rich
in color. I have seen clusters two feet across. On an old willow at Mt.
Gretna, a cluster 18 in. across afforded a dozen meals. Whenever a meal
was wanted a pound or two was broken off. It lasted until January. If P.
sulphureus is cooked properly it is a delicious fungus. Cut fine, stew
slowly and well, season, add butter, milk with a little thickening.


=P. macula´tus= Pk.—having _maculæ_-spots. =Pileus= of a cheesy
consistence, broad, flattened, sometimes confluent, sessile or narrowed
into a short stem, slightly uneven, white or yellowish-white, marked
with darker zones and watery spots. =Pores= minute, subangular, short,
whitish, sometimes tinged with brown. =Flesh= white.

=Pileus= 4–6 in. broad, 6–8 lines thick.

Prostrate trunks of trees in woods. Worcester. July.

In texture and shape this species is related to P. sulphureus, but the
pores are smaller than in that species. The plants are sometimes
cespitose, sometimes single. The spots in the dried specimens have a
smooth depressed appearance. _Peck_, 26th Rep.

Angora, West Philadelphia. September, 1896. Mt. Gretna, Pa., September,
1897–1898. On white oak trunks. _McIlvaine._

Several specimens of different ages proved good eating. Like P.
sulphureus it must be well cooked.


=P. hetero´clitus= Fr. _Gr_—one of two; _Gr_, to lean. In many cespitose
layers, coriaceous. =Pilei= 2½ in. broad, _orange, sessile, expanded on
all sides from a radical tubercle_, lobed, villous, zoneless. Pores
irregularly shaped and elongated, golden-yellow. _Fries._

On the ground under oak. Rare.

The flat pilei extend horizontally from the tubercle. Irregular,
eccentric. _Stevenson._

Minnesota, _Johnson_.

Haddonfield, N.J., Hopkin’s woods. June to July, 1890–1896. _McIlvaine._

Of all fungoid growth this is the most showy. Its clusters, often a foot
and a half in diameter and spread like mammoth dahlias, are gorgeous in
color and conspicuous in design. Resting upon the ground or reared
against the base of tree or stump, they deceive by their likeness to
gaudy bouquets, left by foreign picnickers. In quality it is the same as
P. sulphureus. It does not, however, retain its edibility. As it ages it
becomes offensive.


=P. por´ipes= Fr.—porous-stemmed. =Pileus= 1.5–3 in. broad, rather
fleshy, sinuately repand, smooth, grayish-brown. =Stem= central or
excentric, firm, smooth, 1.5–3 in. long, 4–6 lines thick, punctuated by
the whitish decurrent pores.

On earth in hilly regions.

=Cap= 2 in. across, light drab, smooth, slightly furfuraceous toward
center, broken into minute appressed squamules, zoned. =Flesh= fibrous,
white-pliable. =Tubes= very shallow, round mouths with obtuse divisions,
china-white, running down to base of stem. =Stem= eccentric, almost
lateral, entirely surrounded by pores, connate at base, ½ in. thick.

=Smell= pleasant.

New York. Ground. August, _Peck_, Rep. 24; Mt. Gretna, Pa., August to
November, _McIlvaine_. A large tufted species growing on the ground in
woods, August to November, _McIlvaine_.

When raw tastes like the best chestnuts or filberts, but rather too dry
cooked. _Curtis._

It must be chopped fine and slowly cooked.


=P. immi´tis= Pk.—wide, rude. =Pilei= cespitose-imbricated, broad,
slightly convex or flattened, more or less rough or uneven,
radiately-wrinkled, tuberculose or fibrous-bristled, zoneless, white,
becoming tinged with yellow or alutaceous in drying. =Flesh= white,
slightly fibrous, soft and moist when fresh, cheesy when dry, with a
subacid odor. =Pores= minute, angular or even subflexuous, about equal
in length to the thickness of the pileus, the dissepiments thin, white,
often at length dentate or lacerate on the edge. =Spores= minute, white,
elliptical, 3–4×18–20µ.

=Pilei= 2–4 in. broad, the flesh commonly 3–4 lines thick.

Decaying ash trunks. East Berne. August.

The species is apparently related to P. cæsareus, but the character of
the pores is quite different in the two species. _Peck_, 35th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. On dead black oak. August to November, 1898.

Several clusters grew on dead black oaks. The pilei overlap and the
wrinkled corrugated margins curve downward, giving them the semblance of
shells. From a distance a group looks like Pleurotus ostreatus. The
substance is juicy; while cooking it is at first bitter, but this
disappears. It becomes tender and well flavored.


=P. alliga´tus= Fr.—_alligo_, to bind to. In many cespitose layers,
fibrous-fleshy, rigid-fragile. =Pilei= tan-isabelline, imbricated,
unequal, _zoneless, villous_. =Pores= minute, soft, white, readily
becoming stopped up with flocci.

Often clavate when young. Commonly wrapping round stipules and grasses.
_Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, pale, 6×7µ _Massee_.

Woodland Cemetery, Philadelphia. Among oak trees on grassy ground. July,
August, September. _McIlvaine._

Tufts frequently weigh two pounds. When young the plant cooks well, is
tender and of sweet, pleasant flavor. When old it has a sour unpleasant
odor.

IV.—APUS.


=P. chio´neus= Fr. _Gr_—snow. White =pileus= 1 in. and more broad,
fleshy, _soft, becoming even, smooth_, zoneless, often extended behind,
margin inflexed. =Pores= curt, very small, round, equal, quite entire.
_Fries._

Always soft, fragile, hyaline-white when moist, shining white when dry.
Odor acid. Without a cuticle. _Stevenson._

=Spores= white, oval, 21×3µ _W.G.S._

New York. Decaying wood of frondose trees. _Peck_, 33d Rep.

Angora, Philadelphia, Mt. Gretna, Pa. On standing and fallen timber.
June to September. _McIlvaine._

This snow-white Polyporus is too conspicuous to be passed unseen. One
does not expect to find snow-balls stuck against trees in August. At a
distance it resembles one. When young and fresh it is good.


=P. betuli´nus= Fr.—_betula_, birch. =Pileus= fleshy, then corky,
hoof-shaped, obtuse, zoneless, smooth, _the oblique vertex in the form
of an umbo_, pellicle thin, separating. =Pores= late of being developed,
curt, minute, unequal, at length separating. _Fries._

On living and dead birch. Common. May to December.

=Pileus= 3–6 in. broad. The pileus is at first pale, then acquiring a
brownish tinge. The edge is always very obtuse. _Stevenson._

The lower surface or hymenium is frequently rough with numerous acicular
projections, making the plant look like a Hydnum when viewed
horizontally. _Peck_, 24th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Massachusetts, Kansas, New York. _Peck_, Rep. 24.

Wherever the birch grows this neat, white-fleshed Polyporus abounds.

When young it is eaten by deer. Dried it burns with a white flame, or
holds fire as well as the best punk. It is a valuable fuel, already
prepared for the stove. In the birch forests near Eagle’s Mere, Pa.,
tons of it can be seen protruding from tree and log.

When very young it is fair. Unpleasant when old.

V.—RESUPINATI.


=P. sinuo´sus= Fr.—full of folds. Broadly effused, adnate, dry, the
evanescent mycelium somewhat rooting, white then yellowish. =Pores=
large, surface flexuous, acute, lacerated. Odor of licorice.

New York. Decaying wood of maple. _Peck_, 40th Rep.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. _McIlvaine._

Of but little food value. Collected carefully and boiled, it yields a
pleasantly flavored liquor.

                           =MERU´LIUS= Hall.

                     (Plate CXXVI, fig. 3, p. 478.)


Hymenophore resting on a loose mold-like mycelium, covered with the
soft, waxy, continuous hymenium, having its surface variously plicate or
wrinkled, the folds forming irregular pores, sometimes obsoletely
toothed.

Generally on wood.

I have tasted, raw, every species I have found. They are all more or
less woody in flavor, and I believe them to be edible. At the best
Merulius would be an emergency genus. M. tremellosus is substantial, as
is M. rubellus Pk.


=M. tremello´sus= Schrad.—_tremellosus_, trembling. Resupinate; margin
becoming free and more or less reflexed, usually radiately-toothed,
gelatinoso-cartilaginous; hymenium variously wrinkled and porous;
whitish and subtranslucent looking, becoming tinged brown in the center.
=Spores= cylindrical, curved, about 4×1µ.

On wood. From 1–3 in. across, remaining pale when growing in dark
places. Margin sometimes tinged rose, radiating when well developed.
_Massee._

=Spores= cylindrical, curved, hyaline, 4×1µ _K._

New York. Old logs, stumps, Catskill mountains. _Peck_, 22d Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa. Common, both rose-colored and translucent brown species,
numerous on decaying wood. October to November, 1898–1899. _McIlvaine._

M. tremellosus is a common species and rather attractive looking. In
substance it approaches Tremella and Peziza. The spore-bearing surface
is superior (turned upward) and then sometimes turned in at the margin
which frequently is bright rose color, sometimes yellowish-rose. It is
rather tasteless—slightly woody in flavor, rather tough. An emergency
species.


=M. rubel´lus= Pk.—_rubellus_, dim. of _ruber_, reddish. Generally
cespitose, imbricated, sessile, dimidiate, soft, tenacious, tomentose,
evenly red, pale when dry; margin mostly undulately inflexed; hymenium
white or flesh-color; folds branching, forming anastomosing pores.
=Spores= elliptical, hyaline, minute, 4–5×2.5–3µ.

=Pileus= 2–3 in. long, 1.5 in. broad.

Somewhat related to M. tremellosus.

On trunks of beech in woods.

Ohio, _Morgan_; Indiana, _Dr. J.R. Weist_; Mt. Gretna, Pa., November.
_McIlvaine._ Specimens identified by Professor Peck.

Tough, but edible.

                        FAMILY III.—=HYDNA´CEÆ.=

=Hymenium= inferior or amphigenous (not confined to one surface), from
the first definitely protuberant, spread over persistent spines,
bristles, teeth, tubercles or papilla. _Fries._

While the highest members of this family possess the general form of the
mushroom, others, lacking a stem, recline on the back (resupinate); the
lowest, without even the appearance of a distinct pileus, seem to be
simply spread over the supporting body (effused). In the highest class
the spines or other spore-bearing surface are inferior, _i. e._, below
the pileus; in the others they are of course superior, _i. e._, above
the pileus.

Of the eleven genera but two contain species of food value. Hydnum,
characterized by its acute spines, embraces species which are eaten as
delicacies, and Irpex, distinguished by its somewhat acute teeth growing
from a ridgy hymenium, contains those which may furnish sustenance in
time of need. In Caldesia, bearing spines, the texture is floccose not
fleshy. Sistotrema has a pileus and a central stem, but instead of
spines bears irregular flattened teeth. The remaining genera are
separated by the tubercles, granules, folds, etc., which take the place
of spines or teeth.

Several species of Hydnum are common to earth and wood, others are
distinct in their habitats.

                        SYNOPSIS OF THE GENERA.

                               =HYD´NUM.=

                   _Gr_—name for some edible fungus.


Hymenium inferior, bearing awl-shaped =Spines=, distinct at the base.
_Fries._

In this genus the spines proceed from an even surface, not folded or
wrinkled, and are covered with the spore-bearing surface.

The forms are extremely variable, the type of the first section, H.
repandum, being easily mistaken for one of the Agaricaceæ until
examined, the stem being nearly central and upright, while in other
forms it is lateral or absent. Some are dimidiate (as if part of the
pileus had been removed and the plant attached by the remaining
portion); the lower forms are resupinate.

                     MES´OPUS. _Gr_—middle; a foot.

  (Entire, simple, stem central. On the ground, mostly in pine woods.)


=H. imbrica´tum= L.—_imbrex_, a tile. =Pileus= about 2–5 in. broad,
_umber_, zoneless, fleshy, rather plane, somewhat umbilicate,
_floccose_, tessulato-scaly. =Flesh= dingy whitish. =Stem= curt, 1–3 in.
long, 1–2 in. thick, even. =Spines= 4–6 lines long, decurrent,
ashy-white.

There are two forms; one with the pileus plane and with thick persistent
scales, another with the pileus somewhat infundibuliform, and with
thinner, at length separating scales. _Stevenson._

=Spores= pale yellow brown, rough, 6–7×5µ _Massee_; 6×5µ _W.G.S._

Fleshy. The numerous scales over lapping toward the center. The surface
of the cap often cracks in a tesselated manner. Flesh dingy, buffish or
reddish. =Spines= short, blunt, grayish-white and mostly of equal
length.

In pine and mixed woods. Autumn.

Of delicate taste. _Cordier._ Edible. _Curtis._

Fine specimens grew at Mt. Gretna, Pa., from September to November.
Until closely examined the cap may be mistaken for that of H. zonatum.
The zones of the latter and the pervading rust-color will distinguish
it. Both are edible, though H. zonatum is much tougher. H. imbricatum is
slightly bitter, raw. It must be sliced thin and well cooked.


=H. læviga´tum= Swartz—_lævis_, smooth. =Pileus= 4–6 in. broad, _umber_,
fleshy, _compact_, firm, regular, plane, _even, very smooth_, margin
circinate (not repand). =Flesh= whitish, compact, but by no means
fibrous, soft when fresh, pliant when dry. =Stem= short, thick, even,
pallid-brown. =Spines= thin, pallid-brown.

Its size is that of H. imbricatum, but it occurs twice as large, with
the pileus minutely rimuloso-rivulose, by no means scaly. The stem
varies curt and unequal or longer and equal. Quite distinct from H.
fragile. _Stevenson._

=Spores= 10–15µ long, _Massee_; globose, warted, pale lemon-yellow, 7µ
_Q._

In pine woods. August to October.

Edible, _Curtis_; edible, _Leuba_. “Eaten in Alpine districts.” _Barla._

=H. scabro´sum= Fr.—_scabrosus_, rough. =Pileus= about 1½-4 in. broad,
_brownish-yellow_, compactly fleshy, at first top-shaped, then plane
above, very convex beneath, at first tomentose, then rough with flocci
which are fasciculate in the form of minute crowded squamules, slightly
repand at the margin. =Flesh= very thick, white, descending into the
stem. =Stem= very curt, 1 in. long, and equally thick, round or
compressed, dotted with the rudiments of spines decurrent upon it,
ash-color, attenuated downward, roundish and blackish at the base.
=Spines= 4 lines long, equal, awl-shaped, dingy-rust color, whitish at
the apex, at first sight grayish-brown. _Fries._

=Spores= 4–5µ diameter. _Massee._

Hydnum scabrosum is frequently found in Pennsylvania, among pines and in
mixed woods where pines grow. It occurs at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and on
Springton Hills under hemlocks.

The caps are soft, fleshy, and equal to H. repandum in quality.


=H. squamo´sum= Schaeff.—_squama_, a scale. =Pileus= 1½-3 in. across,
reddish-brown, fleshy, irregular, depressed, _smooth_, breaking up into
_irregular scales_. =Flesh= whitish. =Stem= curt, attenuated downward,
white. =Spines= grayish-brown, whitish at the apex. _Stevenson._

=Spores= subglobose, 5–6µ diameter. _Massee._

=Pileus= smooth and even when young. =Flesh= whitish. =Spores=
grayish-brown. =Spines= whitish, giving the lower surface a much lighter
appearance than the upper.

Under hemlock and spruce in West Virginia, 1884. _McIlvaine._

Caps are good when sliced thin and well cooked.


=H. subsquamo´sum= Batsch. =Pileus= fleshy, somewhat convex,
subumbilicate, brownish-rust color, superficial scales soon dropping
off; spotted with brown. =Stem= stout, unequal, smooth. =Spines=
whitish, becoming brown, apex remaining whitish. North Carolina,
_Curtis_; Alabama, _Peters_; Massachusetts, _Sprague_. Edible. _Curtis._
Edible. _Cordier._


(Plate CXXXII.)

[Illustration: HYDNUM REPANDUM.]

=H. repan´dum= L.—_repandus_, bent backward (of the cap, upward).
=Pileus= 2–6 in. broad, _pallid_, etc., fleshy, fragile, _somewhat
repand_, rather smooth. =Stem= 2–5 in. long, ½-1½ in. thick, irregularly
shaped, _pallid_. =Spines= 4 lines long, unequal, of the same color.
_Stevenson._

=Spores= pointed, 5–8µ _Massee_.

=Pileus= sometimes depressed, often turned upward at margin, often
waved, sometimes tomentose. Color variable—light-buff, brown, pinkish,
reddish. =Flesh= whitish, compact, fragile. =Spines= conical, up to ¼
in. in length, whitish but rich creamy shades, mostly pointed, but
sometimes appearing to be hollow. =Stem= central or eccentric, sometimes
covered with white down, thick, uneven, usually crooked, solid, fleshy,
light in color.

July to November.

Edible. _Curtis._

Common to most countries, and, although given as a ground-growing
species, it is rather indiscriminate in its habitats. Woods, fields,
leaf-covered or bare places, much decayed wood and stumps are its living
places. Dr. Cooke thinks it irreproachable. Popularly it goes by the
name of the Hedgehog mushroom.

H. repandum varies greatly in shape, color and texture. In the open it
is usually symmetrical and tough; when clustered it is irregular, often
fanciful and quite brittle—tender.

When sliced thin an hour’s slow cooking is sufficient. All writers
commend it, and properly.


=H. rufes´cens= Pers.—_rufus_, red. =Pileus= 2–3 in. across, thin,
fragile, usually regular, pubescent, reddish. =Spines= 1–3 lines long,
regular. =Stem= 1–3 in. long, commonly thin, nearly equal, reddish.

The whole plant is reddish. In all other respects it resembles H.
repandum. Usually more regular.

Commonly found in woods. New York, _Peck_; North Carolina, _Curtis_,
_Schweinitz_.

Edible, _Curtis_. Edible, _Leuba_.

Fries considered H. rufescens a variety of H. repandum, and the writer
agrees with him. It is given distinct place here because Massee and
Stevenson—books in the hands of many students of fungi—give it
importance.

It is quite as good as H. repandum.


=H. ferrugi´neum= Fr. =Pileus= 1–4 in. across, corky, soft, convex, then
plane or depressed, irregularly pitted, ferruginous, at first with
whitish tomentum. =Flesh= ferruginous. =Spines= thin, acute, about 2
lines long, rusty-brown. =Stem= firm, 2–3 in. long, unequal,
rusty-brown. =Spores= subglobose, 4µ diameter.

In fir woods. Often gregarious; soft when young, corky and dry at
maturity. _Massee._

Mt. Gretna, Pa. November to December, 1898. Among pine leaves.

Taste mild, mealy. Tough, but when young it cooks tender.


=H. zona´tum= Batsch. Ferruginous. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad, _equally
coriaceous_, thin, expanded, somewhat infundibuliform, _zoned, becoming
smooth, radiately-wrinkled_, the paler margin sterile beneath. =Stem=
½-¾ in. long, 2–3 lines thick, slender, somewhat equal, floccose, base
tuberous. =Spines= 1–1½ lines long, slender, pallid, then rust-color.
_Stevenson._

=Spores= rough, globose, pale watery brown, 4µ diameter _Massee_.

New York, _Peck_, 24th Rep. Mt. Gretna, Pa. Abundant among hemlocks;
West Virginia. _McIlvaine._

Coriaceous. Edible. It will not cook tender, but yields a pleasant
flavor to a gravy made of its juices.


=H. albo´nigrum= Pk. =Pileus= convex or nearly plane, broadly obconical,
tough but soft and densely tomentose on the upper surface, buff-brown or
smoky brown, often wholly covered with a whitish downy tomentum,
sometimes on the margin only, substance within soft tomentose and
buff-brown in the upper stratum, the lower half hard and black. =Spines=
short, at first white, then whitish or grayish. =Stem= short, often
irregular, compressed or growing together, blackish when moist,
buff-brown when dry, covered with a thick dense tomentum, which is
frequently more abundant toward the base, hard and black within.
=Spores= white, globose, 4–5µ.

=Pileus= 1–3 in. broad, sometimes 2 or 3 confluent. =Stem= 1–2 in. long.

Ground in mixed woods. Gansevoort. August. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State
Bot.

Specimens from pine woods New Jersey, _T.J. Collins_, September, 1897.
1½ in. across. Frequent at Mt. Gretna, Pa.

Edible. Good flavor, but tough.


=H. velle´reum= Pk. This species appears to be very much like the
preceding one (H. albonigrum Pk.) from which it is separated by its
smaller size and the paler brownish or rusty-brown substance of its
pileus and stem. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

At Mt. Gretna, Pa., the species grows with H. albonigrum. In quality it
is the same.


(Plate CXXXIII.)

[Illustration: HYDNUM ALBIDUM.]

=H. al´bidum= Pk. =Pileus= fleshy, thin, broadly convex or nearly plane,
subpruinose, white. =Flesh= white. =Spines= short, white. =Stem= short,
solid, central or eccentric, white. =Spores= subglobose, 4–5µ broad.

The whitish Hydnum is uniformly colored in all parts. It grows in groups
or in clusters. In the latter case the caps are sometimes irregular
because of the crowded mode of growth and the stems are occasionally
eccentric. It is a small species not liable to be mistaken for any other
except possibly for very small pale forms of the spreading Hydnum. But
wholly white examples of this species have never been seen by me.

The =caps= are 1–2 in. broad and the =stems= are generally about 1 in.
long and 3–5 lines thick.

The plants grow in thin woods or in open bushy places and appear in June
and July. It is not a common species, and though well flavored it is not
of very great importance as an edible mushroom, because of its scarcity
and small size. _Peck_, 51st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Port Jefferson. July. This fungus has been tested and found to be
edible. _Peck_, 50th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Mt. Gretna, Pa., 1897. Specimens identified by Professor Peck.
_McIlvaine._

The caps are edible and superior to H. repandum.


=H. fen´nicum= Karst. =Cap= fleshy, fragile, unequal, at first scaly, at
length breaking up, reddish-brick color becoming darker, margin
undulately lobed, 2–4 in. broad. =Flesh= white. =Stem= sufficiently
stout, unequal below, attenuated, flexuous or curved, smooth, of the
same color as the cap, base acute, light white tomentum outside, inside
light pale-blue or dark-gray (wood-ash), 1–3 in. long, .4–1 in. thick.
=Teeth= decurrent, equal, pointed, from white dusky, about 4 mm. long.
=Spores= ellipso-spheroidical or sub-spheroidical, rough, dusky, 4–6µ
long, 3–5µ broad.

Found in gravelly or sandy soil in woods.

Found at Angora near Philadelphia. Top cracked. Identified by Professor
Peck.

Occurs frequently at Mt. Gretna, Pa., ground in mixed woods. August to
September. The taste and smell are at first inviting, but the extreme
bitter which develops destroys all desire to eat it.


=H. spongio´sipes= Pk. =Pileus= convex, soft, spongy-tomentose, but
tough in texture, rusty-brown, the lower stratum more firm and fibrous.
but concolorous. =Spines= slender, 1–2 lines long, rusty-brown, becoming
darker with age. =Stem= hard and corky within, externally
spongy-tomentose, colored like the pileus, the central substance often
transversely zoned especially near the top. =Spores= subglobose,
nodulose, purplish-brown, 4–6µ broad.

=Pileus= 1.5–4 in. broad. =Stem= 1.5–3 in. long, 4–8 lines thick.

Woods. Rensselaer and Saratoga counties. August.

This plant was formerly referred to Hydnum ferrugineum Fr. _Peck_, 50th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found in pine woods, near Haddonfield, N.J., by T.J. Collins, September,
1897. =Cap= and =stem= dark brown. =Spines= darker. =Stem= swelling
toward base, which then tapers in a long rooting way. =Cap= umbilicate.
Specimens identified by Professor Peck.

Edible but tough and uninviting. Yields a good fungoid flavor to the
water in which it is boiled.


=H. gelatino´sum= Scop. Transferred to Tremelledon as T. gelatinosum,
under which heading it is described and its edible qualities noted.

Edible. _Curtis._

Grows upon standing and fallen timber which is attacked by decay. Fir,
oak, beech, ash, birch, hickory and other trees are inhabited by it.
August to frost.

This beautiful species can not be mistaken for any other. Its name is
the best guide to its identification. Dame Nature has made many
exquisite decorations for herself and this is one of them.

It is generally eaten, but is rare. Professor Peck speaks affectionately
of it as a gratuitous adjunct to his bill of fare when on botanical
tramps in the Adirondacks.


=H. caput-ur´si= Fr.—bear-head. 6–8 in. high, 6–8 in. across. Tufts
usually pendulous, compact, white, becoming yellow and brownish.

Closely resembling H. coralloides and in small forms with shorter spines
easily mistaken for it. Position of growth has much to do with its shape
and appearance. On fallen timber the branchlets and spines may be erect.

Hydnum caput-ursi is common in West Virginia forests. It is conspicuous
on standing oaks, and at a distance a puzzling object to one not
familiar with such excrescences. It grows on standing oaks near
Haddonfield, N.J., and sparsely at Mt. Gretna, Pa.

It is more compact, and is tougher than H. coralloides and H. Medusæ,
but cooks tender and is very good.

]


=H. caput-Medu´sæ= Bull.—head of Medusæ. (Plate CXXXV.) 3–18 in. across,
2–8 in. high. Tufts pendulous. White then grayish. Body compact,
tapering to a solid base, more or less stem-like. =Spines= covering
entire surface. Those upon top are long, thin, straight or distorted,
growing shorter around and to the under side where they are short and
straight. The wavy appearance of the slender spines remind of the snaky
locks of Medusa, hence the name.

Edible. _Curtis._ Edible. _Leuba._

On elms at Haddonfield, N.J.; on oaks at Mt. Gretna, Pa., and in
Woodland Cemetery, and on elms in Washington Square, Philadelphia, Pa.
_McIlvaine._

Commonly eaten in Italy and parts of Austria; rare elsewhere in Europe.
Occurring over the United States. Specimens eighteen inches across were
seen by the writer in the West Virginia mountains.

Mr. H.I. Miller, Terre Haute, Ind., sent me a fine specimen weighing 10½
pounds.

The American species, as far as seen by the writer, changes to a light
yellow when ageing. The entire fungus is edible and excellent, but the
tender spines and more delicate parts make a dish equaled by few fungi.


=H. erina´ceum= Bull.—_erinaceus_, a hedgehog. 2–8 in. and more across.
Tufts pendulous. White and yellowish-white becoming yellow-brownish,
fleshy, elastic, tough, sometimes emarginate (broadly attached as if
tuft was cut in two, sliced off where attached), a mass of latticed
branches and fibrils. =Spines= 1½-4 in. long, crowded, straight, equal,
pendulous. =Stem= sometimes rudimentary.

On trunks of oak, beech, etc. July to October.

=Spores= subglobose, 5–6µ diameter _Massee_; white, plain, 5×6µ _W.G.S._

Alabama, _Miss K. Skehan_; Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_; Massachusetts,
_Sprague_; New York, _Peck_, Rep. 22.

Eaten in Germany and France. _Cooke._

A dead beech trunk at Eagle’s Mere, Pa., in August, 1898, bore at least
fifty pounds of it. It draped one side of the tree from root to top with
yellowish, pendulous tufts, with spines up to 3 in. long, which waved in
the wind. The spines and tender parts were stewed, and enjoyed by many.
It shrinks very much in drying, becoming sour.


                      A´PUS. _Gr_—without; a foot.

                (Stemless, dimidiate, margin distinct.)


=H. septentriona´le= Fr.—Northern. Fleshy-fibrous, becoming pale,
imbricated. =Pilei= not numerous, growing one above the other, plane,
behind thick, consolidated, margin straight, whole. =Spines= very
crowded, slender, equal.

The largest known Hydnum.

Received from E.B. Sterling, Trenton, N.J., September, 1897. The
specimens formed part of a dense fasciculate mass weighing over 20
pounds, growing on a beech stump. Edges of the young plant are edible,
but have little taste.

[Illustration]


                              =IR´PEX= Fr.

                               A harrow.


Hymenium inferior, toothed from the first. Teeth firm, somewhat
coriaceous, acute, concrete with the pileus, arranged in rows or like
network, connected at the base by folds, which are gill-like (in sessile
species) or resemble honeycomb (in resupinate ones). Sporophores
4-spored. Growing on wood, somewhat growing from the side or upon the
back, approaching Lenzites and Dædaleæ.

Irpex differs from Hydnum in having the spines connected at the base,
and in their being less awl-shaped and pointed.

It is reported as found well up in the northern States, but its species
prefer warm climates. Irpex contains no choice species, but all I have
tested can be eaten.


=I. obli´quus= Fr.—oblique. White, inclining to pale, effused (spread),
forming an adnate crust, circumference flaxy. Teeth _extended from a
base resembling honeycomb, compressed, unequal, incised_, oblique, 2–3
lines long.

At first abundantly porous, but toothed from the first, at length quite
as in Hydna.

On stumps and dead branches. November to February. _Stevenson._

This spreads in irregular patches on the surface of decaying wood. The
pores for a small space round the margin are round and distinct, but
toward the center are greatly lengthened out, lying one upon another in
an imbricated manner. The color is white at first, when old it changes
to a yellow-brown, and at last to a dirty fuscous black. _Bolton._

At first it looks more like a small white orbicular resupinate Polyporus
than an Irpex. _Peck._

The species is common and can be collected at most times of the year.
When fresh and moist it can be shaved from its host plant. Goodly
quantities can thus be obtained. It stews to a firm gelatinous mass of
pleasant flavor. The lost hunter need not die of starvation in any woods
if he will but study the tree-growing fungi, and especially the small
species, hitherto insignificant in food circles.


=I. car´neus= Fr.—resembling the color of flesh. Reddish, effused, 1–3
in. long, _cartilaginous-gelatinous_, membranaceous, adnate. Teeth
obtuse and awl-shaped, entire, united at the base.

It inclines to Radula and Phlebia. _Stevenson._

On tulip poplar, Haddonfield, N.J., September, 1892; on hickory, Angora,
Philadelphia, September, 1897. _McIlvaine._

The entire fungus is good, cooking like a Hydnum.


=I. defor´mis= Fr.—deformed. White, effused, crustaceous, thin,
circumference pubescent, somewhat flaxy. Teeth _extended in awl-shape
from a minutely porous base, thin_, somewhat digitato-incised (cut in
finger-shape), 1–2 lines long. _Fries._

It approaches the Polypori. Grows on wood. _Stevenson._

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Massachusetts, _Frost_.

Common on stumps and trees. The awl-shaped teeth, which have the
appearance of shreds, can be scraped from the fresh plant, or if dried
plants are moistened, the teeth are detachable, and are food-giving.

=I. fusco-vioia´ceus= Fr.—_fuscus_, brown; _violaceous_, violet.
=Pileus= 2 in. long, more than 1 in. broad, _white inclining to hoary_,
effuso-reflexed, coriaceous, silky, zoned. Teeth in rows in the form of
plates, _brownish-violet_, incised at the apex. _Fries._

On pine trunks. _Stevenson._

Decaying trunks of spruce, abies nigra. Adirondack mountains. July.

Our specimens are not “silky,” as required by the description, but
villose or tomentose-villose as in Polyporus hirsutus and P. abietinus,
the latter of which this species closely resembles. The hymenium,
however, is coarser, more highly colored and lamellated to such an
extent that young specimens might easily be taken for a Lenzites.
_Peck_, 30th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found in West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere.
_McIlvaine._

Very common on logs of coniferous trees. It is difficult to collect it
entirely free from resin, which as a seasoning is not recommended.


                    FAMILY IV.—=THELEPHORA´CEÆ= Fr.

                       _Gr_—a teat; _Gr_—to bear.


=Sporophore= erect and stipitate, with a central stem, effused, with the
upper portion free and bent backward, or entirely resupinate. =Hymenium=
perfectly even or radiately wrinkled, glabrous or minutely bristled with
projecting cystidia; basidia normally 4-spored. =Spores= without a
division, colorless or colored. _Massee._

In Thelephoraceæ are shapes closely resembling those found in Hydnaceæ,
Polyporaceæ and Agaricaceæ. The genus Craterellus is closely allied to
Cantharellus, and, though the spore surface is much less wrinkled or
veined, resembles it in several of its species. Other types show
likeness to Merulius in Polyporaceæ; others to Tremellineæ and
Clavariaceæ. Many puzzles are presented by its species, but the solving
is interesting.

Though populous it contains but few edibles. The best of them is
Craterellus cornucopoides.

(No edible species reported.)


                           =CRATEREL´LUS= Fr.

                           _Crater_, a bowl.


=Hymenium= waxy-membranaceous, distinct but adnate to the hymenophore,
inferior, continuous, smooth, even or wrinkled. =Spores= white. _Fries._

This, the only genus of Thelephoraceæ containing edible fungi, has the
form and general appearance of Cantharellus to which it is allied, but
it is distinguished by its nearly even hymenium, which in Cantharellus
has the form of gills, fold-like and thick but still distinctly gills.
The species vary from fleshy to membranaceous, all having a
funnel-shaped pileus and stem merging into it. On the ground. Autumn.
The slightly veined surface where the spores are borne, and the spores
themselves, when a microscope is brought to bear upon them, distinguish
this genus from Cantharellus; and its thin flesh and funnel-shape from
the large forms of Pistillaria. Several of the species are edible. It is
probable that all are.

Toadstools, despite their name, are more popularly associated with
fairies than with toads. “Fairy rings,” “Fairy Bread” and “Fairy Clubs”
are titles belonging to them, and these link us to the pretty belief of
childhood—a belief we often do not outgrow. A group of C. lutescens or
C. cornucopoides may well be likened to fairy trumpets, or to a tiny
orchestrion thrusting its horns through wood earth where roots of stumps
abound.


=C. cantharel´lus= Schw. (Plate XLVI, fig. 3.) =Cap=n. across, convex,
often becoming depressed and funnel-shaped, glabrous, yellowish or
pinkish-yellow. =Flesh= white, tough, elastic. =Hymenium= slightly
wrinkled, yellow or faint salmon color. =Stem= 1–3 in. high, 3–5 lines
thick, glabrous, solid, yellow. =Spores= on white paper yellowish or
pale salmon.

=Spores= 7.5–10×5–6µ _Peck_.

West Virginia, _McIlvaine_.

No one not looking for minute botanic details would separate this
species from Cantharellus cibarius, especially if found growing near or
with it. The pinkish tinge sometimes present in C. cantharellus I have
never observed in C. cibarius. The present species is of equal
excellence.

=C. cornucopoi´des= Pers.—_cornu_ and _copiæ_, horn of plenty. (Plate
CXXXVI, fig. 8, p. 508.) =Cap= dark sooty shades of gray or brown—shades
of well-worn velveteen—1–2 in. across, whole plant from 2–4 in. high,
trumpet-shaped, or like a funnel with its open mouth, plane, wavy, split
or in folds. Substance very thin and either brittle or tough. The inside
is sometimes minutely scaly, the opening extending to the base; outside,
where the spores are borne, it has neither gills, pores nor
protuberances, but a slightly uneven surface varying little in color.
=Stem= obsolete or seldom noticeable. =Odor= slight.

=Spores= pointed, 11–12×7–8µ _Massee_.

Grows single, clustered or in troops along shaded roads, or from leaf
mold and ground in woods. July to frost.

Large patches, clustered, grow near stumps in moist places on Botanic
Creek, West Philadelphia. It is plentiful near Haddonfield, N. J., at
Mt. Gretna, Pa., and many other places in the United States.

It is not pleasant to look upon, because of its peculiar color, but when
one gets used to it it has an attractiveness of its own. Its graceful
shape, even its funereal hue and name—Trompet du Morte—are alluring.

It dries well, and when moistened expands to its normal size. It is a
first-class edible fungus. It should be stewed slowly until tender.


=C. clava´tus= Fr.—_clava_, a club. =Pileus= 2 in. broad, somewhat
light-yellowish, fleshy, _top-shape, truncate_ or depressed, flexuous,
unpolished, _attenuated into the solid stem_. =Flesh= thick, white.
=Hymenium= even, then corrugated, purplish then changing color. _Fries._

=Spores= elliptical, pale-yellow, 10–12×4–5µ _Massee_.

Professor Peck notes that the species so closely resembles Cantharellus
cibarius that it might easily be mistaken for a deformed condition of
it.

The resemblance to the yellow forms of Clavaria pistillaria is marked.

Massachusetts, _Sprague_, _Farlow_; New York, _Peck_, Rep. 32; West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

An excellent species. Its scarcity is regrettable.


=C. du´bius= Pk. =Pileus= infundibuliform, subfibrillose, lurid-brown,
pervious to the base, the margin generally wavy and lobed. =Hymenium=
dark cinereous, rugose when moist, the minute crowded irregular folds
abundantly anastomosing, nearly even when dry. =Stem= short. =Spores=
broadly elliptical or subglobose, 6–7.5µ long.

=Plant= simple or cespitose, 2–3 in. high. =Pileus= 1–2 in. broad.

Ground under spruce trees. Adirondack mountains. August.

In color this species bears some resemblance to Cantharellus cinereus.
From Craterellus sinuosus it is separated by its pervious stem, and from
C. cornucopoides by its more cespitose habit, paler color and smaller
spores. _Peck_, 31st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

Its edible qualities are in every way equal to those of C.
cornucopoides.


=C. sinuo´sus= Fr.—_sinus_, a curve. Strong scented. =Pileus=
funnel-shaped, downy, grayish-brown, margin undulated. =Stem= pale
yellow, elongated, stuffed. =Hymenium= with anastomosing ribs, grayish.
=Spores= elliptical, pale yellow, 8–9×5µ.

In woods. =Pileus= ½-1 in. high and broad. =Stem= about 1 in. high,
sometimes very short. =Smell= strong, musky. =Hymenium= becoming
tan-color when dry. =Pileus= more or less villose. _Massee._

The above description is given so that Var. crispus which follows may be
compared with it. Fries considered var. crispus a good species.

Var. _cris´pus_—_crispus_, curled. (Plate CXXXVI, fig. 7, p. 508.)
Margin of hymenium sinuous and crisped. =Pileus= pervious. =Stem=
stuffed at base only. =Hymenium= almost even. _Massee._

Solitary and cespitose in mixed woods.

Found by _Dr. S.C. Schmucker_ near West Chester, Pa., 1896; _Wm. H.
Rorer_, Mt. Gretna, Pa., August, 1897.

=Cap= varies in color from dark to light brownish-gray. =Gills=
brownish-gray, almost even. =Stem= hollow, dark yellow. =Smell= strong,
musky, much like A. silvicola.

Substance tender and of markedly high and pleasant flavor.

[Illustration]

                       FAMILY V.—=CLAVARIA´CEÆ.=


=Hymenium= not distinct from the hymenophore, covering entire outer
surface. Somewhat fleshy, not coriaceous, vertical, simple or branched.
_Fries._

For the most part growing upon the ground.

In this family there is no separation into stem and pileus, with the
spore-bearing surface restricted to gills or tubes, but the substance of
the plant is continuous, and the spores are produced on the clubs or
branches.

But three genera—Clavaria, Sparassis and Pistillaria—include species of
food value. They are easily recognized.

The genus Calcocera resembles Clavaria in form, but is very different in
material, being a jelly-like viscid, cartilaginous substance, horny when
dry, resembling that of Tremella.

                          SPARASSIS. Page 512.

Very much branched, branches compressed, plate-like, crisped.

                                TYPHULA.

Simple or club-shaped, with a thread-like stem.

                          CLAVARIA. Page 513.

Fleshy, simple or branched, branches typically round, some forms
club-shaped.

                              PISTILLARIA.

Club-shaped, simple, rigid when dry; usually minute.

                                PTERULA.

Branches numerous, slender, forming a tuft, or single, leathery, round
or compressed.


                            =SPARAS´SIS= Fr.

                        _Gr_—to tear in pieces.


Fleshy, branched, with flat leaf-like branches, composed of two plates,
fertile on both sides, with four-spored sporophores. _Fries._

Very beautiful plants of striking appearance.

Unfortunately they are not common, although they generally occur yearly
in the same locality.


=S. Herb´stii= Pk. Plants much branched, forming tufts 4–5 in. high and
5–6 in. broad, whitish, inclining to creamy-yellow, tough, moist, the
branches numerous, thin, flattened, concrescent, dilated above and
spatulate or fan-shaped, often somewhat longitudinally curved or wavy,
mostly uniformly colored, rarely with a few indistinct, nearly
concolorous, transverse zones near the broad, entire apices.

=Spores= subglobose or broadly elliptical, 5–6×4–5µ.

Trexlertown. August.

Closely allied to S. spathulata Schw., but differs in its paler color
with no rufescent hues, more branching habit and absence of any distinct
zones.

Four specimens were found at Mt. Gretna, Pa., during August, 1898. These
were not as symmetrical as S. crispa, which they closely resembled in
fold and texture. They were of equal excellence cooked.


=S. lamino´sa= Fr.—a thin plate. =Base= branching, straw-color.
=Branches= erect, crowded, growing together, straight at the top,
zoneless, entire.

North Carolina, _Curtis_. On oak log.

Edible, _Curtis_. “Deliciosa,” _Fries_.

=S. cris´pa= Fr.—_crispus_, curly. (Plate CXXXVII.) =Height= 3–12 in.,
width 4–24 in. Tufts very handsome, whitish, oyster color or
pale-yellow, very much branched. =Branches= flat, leaf-like. Spore
surface on both sides, sometimes crimped on edges. Compacted into a
round mass, ending below in a solid rooting base.

=Spores= pale-ochraceous, 5–6×3–4µ _Massee_.

Very variable in size. On ground in woods and grassy places in open
woods. Summer, autumn. North Carolina, _Curtis_; West Virginia, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

Have seen it 2 ft. across. “Delicosissima.” _Fries._

A perfect specimen of S. crispa resembles a huge rosette, round and
many-folded in tortuous design. The folds are wide, flattened branches
springing from a common base, thin, semi-transparent, not unlike damp
sheets of gelatine although thicker. Surfaces of the leaves are dull,
like the flattened seaweeds and the light-colored sea-rock mosses. S.
crispa may be easily dried, and though shrinking much in size, retains
its shape, forming a very pretty ornament for the desk of the
mycologist. It is not common. Where it has chosen a habitat several
tufts may be found during the moderate season. The writer found three
specimens ranging from 6–12 in. in diameter near Haddonfield, N.J.,
others, not as large, in West Virginia and in Chester county, Pa.

It has long been known as edible. It makes an ever-to-be-remembered
dish.


                             =CLAVA´RIA= L.

                            _Clava_, a club.


Fleshy, branched or simple, somewhat round, without a distinct stem.
=Hymenium= continuous, dry, homogeneous. _For the most part growing on
ground._ _Fries._

The members of this genus vary greatly in form, which in some is that of
a club growing singly or cespitose, while others present a more or less
bush-like appearance, being slightly or excessively branched.

The color of the plant covers a wide range, as it may be white, red,
yellow, violet or their various shades, and to be in harmony the spores
do not confine themselves to one color, but are white, ochraceous or
cinnamon. In cases where the plant is not otherwise well defined the
spore colors will be found a valuable aid in placing it.

Excepting to toadstool hunters the Clavaria, though numerous, are not
known to those who “Know a toadstool when they see it.” They bear no
semblance to the stereotyped toadstool. They seem to possess an
imitative faculty. Those growing among grasses harmonize with the faded
stalks under debris or the bleached surfaces of blades famishing for
sunlight; those of the woods take on the color of the leaf mat or of the
lichens, and shapes of club and deer-horn mosses, or assemble in groves
as pigmy trees, boled and sturdy-branched in mimicry of their giant
protectors towering above them. In their forms many are delicate,
graceful, beautiful, others are intricate. There is fascination for eye
and brain in looking through the vistas and labyrinths of their
branches.

A few species are tough as shoe-strings; a few bitter; one, C.
dichotoma, on the authority of Leuba, contains a minor poison. The genus
is plentiful and reliable. Many individuals are of marked excellence. In
soups, stews, patties, they remind one of noodles; sometimes of
macaroni. The hard parts of the stem should be removed, the branches
broken or cut in ½ in. lengths. If stewed, they require time and slow
cooking; if fried in butter they are crisp, choice bits.

                      _A._ SPORES WHITE OR PALLID.

            * _Plant, color bright, red, yellow or violet._


=C. fla´va= Schaeff.—yellow. Fragile, trunk thick, fleshy, white, very
much branched. =Branches= even, round, fastigiate, obtuse, yellow.
_Fries._

=Height= 2–4 in., 2–4 in. across; pale-yellow, dingy-yellow. =Stem= or
trunk short, robust, whitish. =Branches= very numerous, dense, fragile,
erect, straight, lighter than the yellow tips (fading with age) which
are toothed. =Flesh= white. =Spores= white. Taste and odor pleasant.

Woods and open places. June to frost.

Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
_McIlvaine_.

The C. flava and C. botrytes have long been noted edible species,
liberally commended abroad and in the United States. Variations in their
structure are interchangeable; variations in their quality are due to
environment. There is a slight difference in the measurement of their
spores, but the difference is not so great as between spores of the same
specimen. Specific differences may exhibit themselves in young plants,
yet disappear with age.

Plants for the table should be young and fresh. When aged or when the
ravages of insects appear, they should not be used, as they then have an
unpleasant taste which will effect a whole dish.

They should be cut into small pieces and stewed slowly for fully thirty
minutes. They can be seasoned and eaten as a stew or made into patties.


=C. botry´tes= Pers. _Gr_—a cluster of grapes (from shape). =Height= 3–4
in., 3–6 in. across, white, yellow, pinkish, dingy in shades of these
colors. =Base= thick, short, fleshy, unequal. =Branches= many, swollen,
thick, crowded, unequal, enlarged at the ends and divided into several
small branchlets which are sometimes reddish at tips. =Flesh= white.

=Spores= ellipsoid, sub-transparent, white, 8×5µ _Massee_.

On wood earth. Common.

New York, _Peck_, Rep. 24; West Virginia, New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

A general favorite and highly esteemed in Europe. Edible. _Curtis._

“When old the branches both of this species and of C. flava become
elongated, obtuse, very fragile, and of a uniform color. The yellow tips
of the latter and the red ones of the former species wholly disappear.”
_Peck_, 32d Rep.

Excepting when young (not always then) the red tips to the branchlets
can not be relied upon as distinctive features of this species. The
place of its growth and the character of the soil have very much to do
with its size, and the color and quality of its flesh. A well-shaded
thin-soiled spot will, after a rain, grow pale, spindling, tender
bunches, having but a tinge of red upon the points; perhaps not any. A
rich, better lighted spot will produce more robust and highly colored
plants. The same can be said of C. flava. C. botrytes is plentiful in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia and like latitudes. It must be
well cooked.


=C. amethys´tina= Bull.—amethyst in color. (Plate CXXXIX, fig. 1, p.
516.) =Height= ½-3 in. =Color= violet, very much branched or almost
simple. =Branches= round, even, fragile, smooth, obtuse, known by its
color.

=Spores= elliptical, pale ochraceous, sub-transparent, 10–12×6–7µ
_Massee_.

Common in open woods and grassy places.

New York, _Peck_ 30th Rep.; West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
_McIlvaine_. August, September.

Eaten in Europe, and by some preferred to any other.

A handsome species, very brittle, and though large, delicate.


=C. fastigia´ta=—_fastigium_, the top. =Height= 1–2 in., tufted, yellow.
=Branches= numerous, flexible, tough, equal, fastigiate (branches
pointing upward), sometimes short and simple, when higher very much
branched.

=Spores= white, irregularly globose, 4–6µ _Massee_.

In pastures and grassy places, during warm months.

North Carolina, _Curtis_; California, West Virginia, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

Commonly eaten throughout Europe. In Germany they call it
Ziegenbart—goat’s beard.

This is one of the species that has to be looked for. Grass tufts hide
it. Its yellowish stools are not unlike them in color. It is freely
found, and, though not of the best, well rewards the seeker.

golden-yellow, sometimes brownish at the apex. =Flesh= white. =Branches=
when present, short, simple or terminating in few or many more or less
acute denticles. =Spores= globose, 7.5µ broad, minutely roughened;
mycelium white.

Ground under hemlock trees. Orono, Me. September. _F.L. Hervey._

Allied to C. fastigiata and C. muscoides, but distinct from both by its
more irregular and less branching character and by its larger spores.
_Peck_, 45th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Near Haddonfield, N.J., August, 1890, among scrub pines and spruce. A
pretty species of medium flavor.

                  ** _Plant white, gray or yellowish._


=C. coralloi´des= Linn. =Height= 2–4 in., usually tufted, growing into
each other, white. =Trunk= thick, short, much branched. =Branches=
repeatedly forked, compressed, hollow within, fragile, dilated upward,
tips crowded acute.

Occasionally the branches do not develop entirely and are obtuse; they
then somewhat resemble in shape C. rugosa, but are not wrinkled.

=Spores= pale-ochraceous, pointed, 10×8µ _Massee_.

Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
_McIlvaine_.

A common edible species in Europe. Common in United States.

The writer has eaten it for many years. It is not always tender. It
should be young, fresh, and the branches alone cooked. It requires slow,
patient cooking if at all old. It does dry well, as stated by some
writers, but it does not wet well again.

=C. cine´rea= Bull.—_cinis_, ashes. (Plate CXL.) =Height= 1–3 in.,
gregarious or tufted, sometimes in rows. Gray. =Stem= either thin or
thick, short, lighter than branches. =Branches= very numerous
compressed, wrinkled, irregular, somewhat obtuse or flattened and
divided into slender points.

Its gray color easily distinguishes it from others. It is variable in
its mode of growth and in its shape.

On ground in woods. Common. June to frost.

Eatable, but injurious in quantities. _Cordier._ Edible, but provokes
indigestion in delicate stomachs. _Leuba._

Eaten generally in Europe. In France it is called _pied de coq_.

Plentiful in United States, in mixed woods. June to frost.

The writer and his friends have eaten it for fifteen years, and know of
no Clavaria equalling it.

=C. crista´ta= Pers.—_crista_, a crest. (Plate CXLI, p. 518.) =Height=
1–5 in., whitish, tufts of broad flattened branches cut on margins or
crested. =Base= short, stout. =Branches= numerous, irregular, flattened
upward and divided like moose horns, tough, stuffed, dingy. This
peculiarity distinguishes it and separates it from C. coralloides.

=Spores= pale ochraceous, pointed, 10×8µ _Massee_.

Woods. Common. Summer and autumn. Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; West Virginia,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

Edible. _Curtis._

After a summer rain the crested Clavaria is usually abundant where there
is good encouragement of mossy beds or mats of rich wood-soil in woods
where leaves and mold accumulate. It is not as tender as many other
species, but chopped fine and stewed slowly for an hour it will be eaten
with enjoyment.


=C. rugo´sa= Bull.—_ruga_, a wrinkle. White or dingy, simple or tufted,
2–4 in. high, branched from the base with irregular blunt branches
wrinkled lengthwise, sometimes thickened upward.

Distinguished by the distinct, irregular, longitudinal wrinkles.

=Spores= white, irregularly globose, 8–10µ _Massee_.

In woods, solitary or gregarious. August to November.

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_. Pennsylvania, Ohio.

It is reported edible by Dr. Curtis, M.C. Cooke and Dr. Badham.


=C. pyxida´ta= Pers.—_pyxis_, a small box. Tufted, light tan-color,
shaded with red, 1–3 in. high. =Stem= or trunk thin, smooth, variable in
length, dividing into many erect forked branches, which are cup-shaped
at the tips. The margins of these tips have slender branchlets issuing
from them (proliforme).

Distinguished by the cup-like tips. =Spores= white, 4×3µ _Massee_.

On rotten wood, on rotten roots in ground. June and into the autumn.

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

Specimen sent by writer to Prof. Peck, June, 1897, and identified by
him. Not tested by writer, but is in Dr. Curtis' list of edible species.


=C. subtil´is= Pers. Scattered, slender, subtenaceous, pallid-white,
bases smooth and of equal thickness, branches few, forked,
subfastigiate.

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Pennsylvania.

Edible. _Curtis._


=C. den´sa= Pk. =Tufts= 2–4 in. high, nearly as broad, whitish or
creamy-yellow, branching from the base. =Branches= very numerous, nearly
parallel, crowded, terete, somewhat wrinkled when dry, the tips dentate,
concolorous. =Spores= slightly colored, elliptical, 7.5–10×5–8.5µ.

Ground in woods. Selkirk. August.

Apparently closely allied to C. condensata, but differing decidedly in
color. _Peck_, 41st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Specimens identified by Professor Peck.

Large masses of it grew at Mt. Gretna, Pa., July, August and September,
1898, in mixed woods.

Brittle; when young it is very compact. It is without much flavor, but
stews tender and makes a good dish.

=Trunk= thick, elastic, pallid. =Flesh= white, dividing into numerous
thick branches that become repeatedly divided in a dichotomous manner
upward, and terminate in slender, erect, round, yellow branchlets.
=Spores= pale ochraceous, elliptical, 10–11×5–6µ.

In woods. Forming large tufts 2–3 in. high, colorless or almost so
below, tips yellow. _Massee._

North Carolina, _Curtis_; Ohio, Alabama. Found in West Virginia, 1882;
Devon, Angora, Eagle’s Mere, Mt. Gretna, Pa.; Haddonfield, N.J. August
and September. _McIlvaine._

Eaten in Europe. Edible. _Curtis._

In structure it reminds one of a miniature cropped Lombardy poplar. The
color is not bright, but dingy-yellow. Resembles C. flava; distinguished
by different color of spores. The branches (not stem) are tender and
good.

Var. _rufes´cens_ Schaeff.

This plant occurs after heavy rains. It sometimes grows in continuous
rows several feet in extent. The pinkish-red tips of the branches fade
with age. The axils are rounded and the plant is quite fragile. Fries
considers it a variety of C. aurea. _Peck_, 25th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Found at Springton, Chester county, Pa., August, 1887. It is edible and
good. The plant is tender and easily cooked.


=C. formo´sa= Pers.—_formosus_, finely formed. (Plate CXXXIX, fig. 3, p.
416.) =Height= 2–4 in. =Trunk= 1 in. and more thick, whitish or
yellowish, elastic. =Branches= numerous, crowded, elongated, divided at
ends into yellow branchlets which are thin, straight, obtuse or toothed.

=Spores= ochraceous 9×3–4µ _Massee_; elongated, oval, rough, 16×8µ
_W.G.S._

On ground in woods, in large tufts, frequently in rows several feet
long.

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
_McIlvaine_.

Esteemed in Europe. Edible. _Dr. Curtis._

Common in the United States in woods. Variable. An orange-rose color is
sometimes prominent on the tips. The tenderer portions of the plant are
excellent, but must be well cooked.


=C. spinulo´sa= Pers.—spined. =Height= 2–3 in. high. =Stem= ½-1 in.
thick. =Trunk= stout, short, whitish. =Branches= numerous, crowded,
erect, tense, elongated, tapering upward. =Color= cinnamon-brown or
darker.

=Spores= ochraceous, elliptical, 11–13×5–6µ _Massee_.

On ground in pine woods. August to October.

New York, _Peck_, 24th Rep.; New Jersey, _Sterling_; Pennsylvania,
_McIlvaine_.

Of same edible quality as C. aurea, which it resembles, excepting that
it is darker and less abrupt in the ending of its clusters.


=C. flac´cida= Fr.—_flaccidus_, flaccid. =Height= 1–3 in., bright
ochraceous, slender. =Stem= short, smooth, sometimes wanting, thin, 1–2
lines thick, repeatedly branched. =Branches= crowded, unequal, flaccid,
upper ones forcep-shaped, pointed. Does not turn green when bruised like
C. abietina. The whitish mycelium creeps over the leaves on which it
grows. Brittle, tender, flesh white.

=Spores= ochraceous, broadly elliptical 4–5×3µ _K._

Received from E.B. Sterling, Trenton, N.J.

Two specimens eaten. These were quite dry. After soaking they were
tender and had good flavor.

=C. cir´cinans= Pk.—_circino_, to make round. (Plate CXLII.) =Stem=
short, solid, dichotomously or subverticillately branched. =Branches=
slightly diverging or nearly parallel, nearly equal in length, the
ultimate ones terminating in two or more short acute concolorous ramuli.
=Spores= ochraceous.

=Plant= 1–2 in. high, obconic in outline, flat-topped, appearing almost
as if truncated, pallid or almost whitish in color, generally growing in
imperfect circles or curved lines.

Under spruce and balsam trees. Adirondack mountains. August. _Peck_,
39th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Where pines have grown, but where now oak and chestnut trees make rather
open woods, it grows at Mt. Gretna, Pa. A stumpy fungus impressing one
as stunted. Its texture is solid. It does not cook tender, but yields a
fungus flavor to the cooking medium.


                         ** _Growing on wood._


=C. stric´ta= Pers.—_stringo_, to draw tight. =Height= 2–3 in. =Color=
pale dull-yellow becoming brown when bruised. =Stem= distinct, thick,
short. =Branches= numerous, repeatedly forked, straight, closely
pressed, tips pointed.

=Spores= dark cinnamon, _Fries_; creamy yellow 4×6µ _W.G.S._

Var. _fu´mida_. The whole plant is a dingy, smoky-brownish hue,
otherwise of the typical form. Catskill mountains. September. In the
fresh state the specimens appear very unlike the ordinary form, but in
the dried state they are scarcely to be distinguished. _Peck_, 41st Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

Eaten in Germany.

This form occurs in West Virginia mountains and at Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
Trenton, N.J., in August and September, among leaves in mixed woods. It
compares favorably with the ordinary run of Clavaria.


=C. dicho´toma= God.—dividing by pairs. Cespitose, white; branches
regularly dividing by pairs, elongated, flexuous, diverging, somewhat
compressed, extremities obtuse, rounded at or just below the apex
broadly compressed.

On the ground, under beeches.

“Notwithstanding its beauty this is dangerous. In 1883, when it was very
plentiful, I saw entire families sick from it and in 1888 there was a
repetition with new victims. “It produces nausea, vertigo and violent
diarrhea.” _Leuba._

I have not seen the plant.

somewhat fusiform, simple and toothed, even, attenuated to the base
which is of the same color. _Stevenson._

=Spores= pale yellow, globose, 4–5µ _Massee_.

Closely resembles C. inæqualis Fl. Dan.

Woods and pastures. August to November.

Received from _E.B. Sterling_, Trenton, N.J., August, 1897.

The clubs are 1⁄16 in. through, 4 in. high, light clear yellow,
translucent, clustered in groups of four or five united at the base.

Tender, well flavored, cooks easily.


=C. auran´tio-cinnabari´no= Schw.—_aurantius_, orange; _cinnabaris_,
vermilion. Orange-red; base white with a sub-hairy powder; clubs simple,
flexuous, fleshy, somewhat tenacious, fasciculate, thickened in the
middle and attenuated toward either end, at first cylindrical then
compressed, 6–7 mm. thick, 2–4 in. high.

Pennsylvania. On the ground among rhododendrons.

Received from _E.B. Sterling_, Trenton, N.J.

The plant when fresh is a beautiful rose color, inclining to orange at
the tips. It reminds one of the peach-blow vase color in some of its
shades. The single clubs, growing in cluster, to the height of four
inches, graceful in outline, exquisitely shaded, are a sight one lingers
over. While they invite the mycophagist to eat them, his voracity is
checked by their beauty. They are tender and delicious. It is
regrettable that thus far it has not been reported in quantity.


=C. inæqual´is= Fl. Dan.—unequal. =Height= 2–3 in. club-shaped, yellow,
gregarious, single or in loose tufts, fragile, _stuffed_. =Clubs=
club-shaped or almost equal, simple, sometimes forked or variously cut
at tip, one color.

=Spores= colorless, elliptical, 9–10×5µ _Massee_.

Woods and pastures. August to October.

Distinguished from C. fusiformis by the tips not being sharp-pointed and
colored.

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_; New Jersey, _Sterling_.

This Clavaria is quite common in New Jersey. Its clusters are clear
bright yellow and conspicuously pretty. The clubs are translucent and
smooth. Excepting in color it resembles C. aurantio-cinnabarino. In the
many specimens seen there was nothing to suggest the propriety of the
name, excepting height of clubs.

A dish of it is a delicacy.


=C. vermicula´ris= Scop.—_vermis_, a worm. =Height= 1–2½ in., white,
tufted. =Clubs= simple, quill-shaped, stuffed, awl-shaped, brittle,
pointed.

=Spores= white, elliptical, 4×3µ _Massee_.

New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio. Thin grassy woods and
among grass. July to October.

Edible. _Cordier._

Common in southern New Jersey, and in warm soils from June to frost.
When growing among grass it is not conspicuous and is often missed
unless specially sought for. Its purity, its choice of refreshing abode,
its excellent qualities, make it select among Clavaria.


                 HOLOCO´RYNE. _Gr_—entire; _Gr_—a club.

               Clubs almost simple, distinct at the base.


=C. pistillar´is= L.—_pistillum_, a pestle. (Plate CXXXVIII, figs. 2, 3,
p. 522.) =Height= 2–12 in., up to 1 in. and more thick, color light
yellow, ochraceous, brownish, chocolate. =Clubs= Indian-club shape,
ovate-rounded, puckered at top, simple, fleshy, white within, spongy,
exterior smooth or more or less wrinkled, usually with smooth base.

=Spores= white, 10×5µ _W.G.S._; 9–11×5–6µ _Massee_.

Mixed woods, moss and grassy places. August until November.

North Carolina, Pennsylvania, California, Alabama.

Eaten in Poland, Russia and Germany.

The writer first found this truly club-like species in West Virginia in
1882, and ate it. But few specimens were found, and those of a dark
chocolate color. At Mount Gretna in 1897 and 1898 the yellow variety
grew in considerable quantity from July until after frost. The largest
specimen found measured 5½ in. and was 1 in. in diameter at its thickest
part. The average height is 2½ in. Both varieties grew in mixed woods
from the leaf-covered ground. They are often clustered, four or five
together, and of different sizes. The surface, especially of the dark
variety, is regularly, vertically wrinkled, truncated in few places,
very much resembling that of the Craterellus cantharellus. The stems of
both are white. The apex of the clubs is folded inward as though pulled
by drawing-strings.

The flesh is soft, white, fine grained. A slight bitter is present in
the dark variety, when raw, which entirely disappears upon cooking. This
is one of the best of Clavariæ.


=C. clava´ta= Pk. Simple, straight, clavate, obtuse, smooth, not hollow,
yellow when fresh, rugose-wrinkled and orange-colored when dry, 4–6
lines high.

Damp shaded banks by road-sides. Sandlake. June. _Peck_, 25th Rep. N.Y.
State Bot.

Patches of it are conspicuous—golden-hued upon somber background. They
are seen at Eagle’s Mere, Mt. Gretna, and on the Springton Hills, Pa.,
along wooded road-sides. Raw, they have a mild, pleasant flavor, and
have the same when cooked. A small species seldom found in sufficient
quantity to make a comforting dish.

                     FAMILY VI.—=TREMELLA´CEÆ= Fr.


Whole fungus homogeneous, gelatinous, shrivelling when dry, reviving
when moistened, pervaded internally with branched filaments, terminating
toward the surface all round in sporophores. Spores transparent, from
globose to sausage-shape and curved, sometimes septate. _Fries._

The Tremellaceæ, as their name signifies, tremble, because jelly-like
when moist. They are hard, tough, horny when dry, but swell and become
gelatinous when wet. In the typical genus, Tremella, there is often but
little consistency. Whoever has climbed an old rail fence on a rainy day
has had the doubtful pleasure of acquaintance with some of them.
Sections for the microscope are obtainable by hardening them in alcohol.

There are several edible species in the family. They are good in soups,
giving them flavor and body, and some are excellent when stewed.

                         _Hirnea_, a small jug.


Gelatinous, rather cartilaginous, soft and tremulous when moist, but not
distended with jelly, horny when dry, becoming somewhat cartilaginous
when moistened. The hard skin forming the hymenium, which covers the
cup-shaped cavity and is of a different color, can be separated entire
after a thorough soaking in water. =Sporophores= (spore-bearing
processes) not involved in jelly. =Spores= oblong, curved. _Fries._

A very peculiar and distinct genus separated from the neighboring genera
by its disk-like, somewhat cup-shaped cavity and by its not being
distended with jelly.


                                                         (Plate CXLIII.)

  HIRNEOLA AURICULA-JUDEA.
  About two-thirds nat. size.
]

=H. auri´cula—Jude´a= (Linn.) Berk.—Jew’s ear. 1–4 in. across, thin, and
flexible when moist, hard when dry, date-brown or blackish. =Hymenium=
venoso-plicate (vein-plaited), forming irregular depressions such as are
in the ear, yellowish-gray or grayish beneath and hairy. The large
depressions or corrugations branch from smaller ones near the center of
the plant.

=Spores= 20–25×7–9µ _Massee_.

H. auricula-Judea is not very particular in the trees it patronizes.
Elm, maple, hickory, balsam-fir, spruce, alder bear it. When the plant
grows on upright timber it usually turns upward. It is not generally
reported in the United States.

Ohio, Maryland, _Miss Banning_; Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; New York,
_Peck_; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, _McIlvaine_.
Extensively used in China, where eating it probably antedates all
European records by several thousand years. It is brought there dried
from Tahiti in great quantities and made into soup.

The writer has found and eaten several specimens of it. It is not as
tender as other gelatinous species, but it is an oddity that pleases.




                       Sub-Family—=Tremellineæ=.




                           =TREMEL´LA= Dill.

                          _Tremo_—to tremble.


Distended with jelly when moist, tremulous, without a defined margin and
without nipple-like elevations. Spore-bearing processes globose,
becoming divided into four parts, each division producing an elongated
free point terminating in a simple spore. _Fries._

Distinguished by its peculiarly convoluted habit and jelly-like
substance, which is more or less inclined to be cartilaginous.

Exidia, similar in form, is separated by possessing minute nipple-like
elevations and Hirneola by its distinct difference in form.

Generally growing on dead wood; some species are found on trees and
others on the ground, etc.

Old tradition, in many countries, attests that the Tremellas are Fairy
bread, and T. albida the choicest baking. Pretty, indeed, must have been
the feasts when piles of such purity filled the board, and the brilliant
Pezizae were wassail cups.

They are better suited to Fairy appetites than to those of mortals;
being watery their nutritive value is small. Nevertheless they have
dainty flavor.

So far as tested no suspicion rests upon Tremellæ.

            MESENTERIFOR´MES (_Gr_—the mesentery). Page 530.

Gelatinous inclining to cartilaginous, foliaceous, naked.

              CEREBRINÆ (_cerebrum_, the brain). Page 530.

Firm, then pulpy, somewhat pruinose with the spores.

                    CRUSTA´CEÆ (_crusta_, a crust).

Diffused, becoming plane.

            TUBERCULIFOR´MES (_tuberculum_, a little tuber).

Small, somewhat erumpent.


      I.—MESENTERIFOR´MES. Gelatinous, inclining to cartilaginous.


=T. fimbria´ta= Pers.—_fimbriæ_, fringe. Olivaceous inclining to black,
cespitose, clusters 2–3 in. high and even broader, _erect, corrugated_;
_lobes_ flaccid, incised at the margin, _undulately fringed_.

When soaked with water it has a dark tawny tinge. _Stevenson._

=Spores= subpyriform.

On roots, dead branches, stumps, rails, etc.

From July to December, 1898, tufts five inches in diameter grew from an
oak stump close by the writer’s cottage at Mt. Gretna, Pa. These tufts
dried, and revived after rain into a gelatinous condition. They were
nibbled at raw, and several were cooked. Tufts were found elsewhere in
the same woods and eaten by others. They were unanimously approved. The
species dries hard, like thin glue, but is darker. A dried piece swells
in the mouth, grows tough, and has but little taste. Flavor develops in
cooking.


=T. lutes´cens= Pers.—_luteus_, yellow. _Yellowish_, cespitose, small,
cluster ½-1 in. broad, very soft, circling in wavy, undulating folds;
lobes entire, naked.

Inclining to be fluid. Whitish when young. _Stevenson._

=Spores= subglobose, 12–16µ diameter _Massee_.

North Carolina, common. _Curtis._ On decaying branches, stumps, etc.
July to February.

It dries and revives, or swells with moisture, very soft and tremulous.

Edible. _Leuba._


                  II.—CEREBRINÆ. Firm then pulpy, etc.


(Plate CXLIV.)

[Illustration:

  TREMELLA MESENTERICA.

=T. mesenter´ica= Retz. _Gr_—the mesentary. Gelatinous but firm, bright
orange-yellow, variously contorted; lobes short, smooth, pruinose with
the white spores at maturity. =Spores= broadly elliptical, 6–9µ
diameter; conidia 1–1.5µ diameter.

On dead branches. Very variable in form but known by the bright orange
color. From ½-2 in. across. _Massee._

North Carolina. Common, edible. _Curtis_; California, Ohio, West
Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. _McIlvaine._ Dr. J.R. Weist,
Richmond, Ind., November, 1898, sent me fine specimens.

Very common as an apparent exudation from sticks, branches and rails. It
can usually be collected in quantity from June until far into the
winter. It can be found in every month in the year.

During the civil war the writer’s first attempt at making a dish of
cornstarch resulted in getting it _into knots_. T. mesenterica, when
stewed, very much resembles these same knots. It has a mild, woody
flavor, slightly sweet, and is good.

  TREMELLA MYCETOPHILA on
  COLLYBIA DRYOPHILA.
  (After Peck.)
]

=T. myceto´phila= Pk. (Plate CXLIV_a_.) Suborbicular, depressed,
circling in folds, tremelloid-fleshy, slightly pruinose, yellowish or
pallid, 4–8 lines broad. _Peck_, 28th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Haddonfield, N.J., August, 1895. _McIlvaine._

Professor Peck notes it as found parasitic upon Collybia dryophila.

I found T. mycetophila growing parasitic upon Marasmius oreades, August,
1894. The mass was 2 in. in diameter. Separating them was taking the
host from the parasite. Cooked it is glutinous, tender—like calf’s head.
Rather tasteless.


=T. al´bida= Huds.—_albidus_, whitish. _Whitish_, becoming dingy-brown
when dry, 1 in. broad, ascending, tough, expanded, undulated, somewhat
circling in folds, _powdered_. _Stevenson._

=Spores= oblong, obtuse, curved, 2-guttate, subhyaline, 12–14×4–5µ _K._

Where birch, sugar-maple, hickory are in abundance the T. albida will be
found. At Eagle’s Mere and Springton, Pa., and other wooded places, it
is common during the warm months. It has slight taste, sweet, woody, but
makes a pleasant dish.


=T. intumes´cens= Eng. Bot.—_intumesco_, to swell up. Gelatinous;
subcespitose, rounded, broken up into numerous tortuous lobes, brown,
shining, obscurely dotted, becoming darker when dry. =Spores= oblong,
slightly curved, 12–14×3–4µ.

From 1–2 in. across. _Massee._

Entire year, but dried or frozen during winter, swelling in wet weather.

North Carolina. Common. _Curtis._ West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

T. intumescens is not rare in West Virginia, or where beech logs are in
plenty, though it does not confine itself to beech. It occurs on maples
and some other woods.

It resembles the T. mesenterica in taste, but is sweeter. It is not as
large, but is equally good.




                          =TREMEL´LODON= Pers.

                          _Tremo_, to tremble.


Gelatinous, pileate, prickly below, spines awl-shaped, equal. _Fries._

The members of this genus resemble in form the section Mesopus of Hydnum
and have the same awl-shaped spines, but differ in their gelatinous
consistency and fructification.


(Plate CXLV.)

[Illustration: TREMELLODON GELATINOSUM.]

=T. gelatino´sum= Pers.—_gelatina_, jelly. =Pileus= covered with a
greenish-brown bloom, _gelatinous_, tremulous, dimidiate, somewhat
stipitate, _covered with small pimples_. =Spines= soft, glaucous.

On fir, trunks and sawdust. September to October. _Stevenson._

Of singular beauty, almost translucent with steel-blue tints shading
into violet, while the spines are of a pure soft white.

=Spores= round, somewhat irregular, white, 2µ _W.G.S._

Can not be confounded with any. The only gelatinous spiny fungus.

North Carolina, _Schweinitz_, _Curtis_; Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,
_Farlow_, _Frost_; New York, _Peck_, Rep. 22. T. gelatinosum is well
distributed over the United States but is not reported in quantity. It
is an autumnal grower, lasting well into the winter. The writer found
specimens near Haddonfield, N.J., in February, 1894, and sent them to
Professor Peck. It is delicious when slowly stewed.




                         SUB-CLASS ASCOMYCETES.


The reproductive bodies consisting of sporidia mostly definite,
contained in asci—mother cells or sacs—springing from a naked or
enclosed stratum of fructifying cells and forming a hymenium or nucleus.
The sporidia are often accompanied by simple or branched threads, which
are abortive asci, called paraphyses.

In Hymenomycetes the spores are entirely unenclosed and are borne on
stalk-like processes on the gills of Agaricaceæ, in the tubes of
Polyporaceæ, on the spines of Hydnaceæ, etc. In Ascomycetes they are
enclosed in sacs springing from the external layer of the fruit-bearing
surface, which may be on the outer surface of the plant or enclosed.

           COHORT _DISCOMYCETES_. _Gr_—a sac; _Gr_—a fungus.

The most important distinctive feature of Discomycetes consists in the
disk or hymenium being fully exposed at maturity. It includes families
which contain choice edible species.

                        FAMILY.—=HELVELLA´CEÆ.=

Fleshy, waxy or gelatinous; hymenium or sac-bearing surface exposed at
first, or at length more or less exposed. Where a distinct stem is
present it is surmounted by a more or less definite pileus or the stem
is expanded into a club-like head. In Peziza the definite stem is absent
and the plant is seated on the supporting surface.

Many more genera than are noted below are included in Helvellaceæ, but
are not known to contain edible species.

                        SYNOPSIS OF THE GENERA.

                           A small pot herb.


=Stem= of medium thickness. =Pileus= hanging loosely over the stem, more
or less folded, but not into pits. Hymenium on the upper side only.

Helvella esculenta is now Gyromitra esculenta, and is in bad repute.

Meanings of the unfamiliar words are too lengthy to give in the
descriptions of species. They are in the Glossary.

Dr. Badham says: “All Helvellæ are esculent, have an agreeable odor, and
bear a general resemblance in flavor to the Morell.”


(Plate CXLVI.)

[Illustration:

  HELVELLA CRISPA.
  Natural size.
]

=H. cri´spa= Fr.—curled. =Pileus= deflexed, lobed or variously
contorted, white or whitish. =Stem= equal or slightly swollen at the
base, deeply and uninterruptedly grooved, white or whitish. =Spores=
elliptical, 18×22µ long. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Distinguished from all other species by the stout, costate, lacunose,
hollow stem; entirely glabrous, fragile and with a semi-transparent
look. Color variable, included under the following forms:

Var. _al´ba_. Pileus whitish.

Var. _Grevil´lei_. Under surface of the pileus reddish; stem white.

Var. _incarna´ta_. Pileus and stem flesh-color.

Var. _ful´va_. Pileus yellowish or tawny. _Massee._

Pileus whitish, flesh-colored or yellowish, deflexed, lobed, at length
free, crisped. =Stem= hollow, ribbed outside forming deep pits, 3–5 in.
high, snowy white.

Edible. _Badham_, _Cordier_, _Cooke_, _Berkeley_, _Peck_.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, _McIlvaine_.

H. crispa is white and variable in shape of cap. In its color it differs
from all others of its genus. It is found in the woods only, from July
until frost. It is not usually abundant. It is an esculent species and
good of its kind.


=H. Califor`nica= Phillips. =Pileus= bell-shaped or saddle-shaped,
deflexed, sublobate, free, veined beneath, purplish-brown. =Stem=
longitudinally pitted between ridges, rosy-pink. =Asci= cylindrical,
narrowed toward the base. =Sporidia= 8, elliptical, binucleate, 17×9µ
paraphyses linear, clavate and brown at the apices.

2–6 in. in diameter. =Stem= 2–6 in. high, .75–1.5 in. in diameter.

On the earth in dense forests near rocks. Sierra Nevada mountains;
California, _Harkness_.

Edible. _Harkness._

It presents characters essentially different from those of any species
hitherto described. Its nearest ally is H. crispa, from which it differs
in the color of the hymenium and stem and in being a larger species.


=H. lacuno´sa= Afzel.—uneven, pitted. =Pileus= inflated, lobed,
cinereous-black, lobes deflexed, adnate. =Stem= white or dusky, hollow,
exterior ribbed, forming intervening cavities; asci cylindrical,
stemmed; sporidia ovate, hyaline.

Solitary or gregarious; very variable in size.

North Carolina, _Curtis_; Massachusetts, _Sprague_, _Frost;_ White
mountains, _Farlow_; Rhode Island, _Bennett_; California, _H. and M._

Edible. _Cordier_, _Berkeley_, _Badham_, _Cooke_, _Curtis_.


=H. sulca´ta= Afzel.—furrowed. =Pileus= deflexed, equally 2–3 lobed,
even, compressed, darker when dry. =Stem= 2 in. long, 4–5 lines thick,
stuffed, equal, longitudinally furrowed. =Spores= very broadly elliptic,
with a single large globose nucleus, 15–18µ long _B. and Br._

Solitary, rarely gregarious.

Var. _mi´nor_ Clem. Bot. Surv. of Neb. Univ. of Neb. Pileus .8–1.2 in.,
rarely 3.2 in. wide, .8–2 in. high. Stem .8–1.2 in., rarely 4 in. high,
.6–1.4 in. wide; sporidia 15×10µ.

On shady ground. Otowanie woods, Lancaster county.

The prominent character in this species, as indicated by the name, is
the sulcate stem. The furrows are very deep, and extend, without
interruption, the entire length of the stem. The whole stem, as shown by
a cross-section, is made up of the costæ intervening between these
furrows. I do not find the stem “stuffed,” as required by the
description in Syst. Myc., Vol. II, p. 15. The pileus is generally
darker than that of H. crispa. _Peck_, 31st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

On decaying wood, stumps, trunks. Spring until autumn.

Known to be edible. _Peck._


=H. elas´tica= Bull.—elastic. =Pileus= free from the stem, drooping, 2–3
lobed, center depressed, even, whitish, brownish or sooty, almost smooth
underneath, about 2 cm. broad. =Stem= 2–3.5 in. high, 3–5 lines thick at
the inflated base; tapering upward, elastic, even or often more or less
pitted, colored like the pileus, minutely velvety or furfuraceous, at
first solid, then hollow. =Spores= hyaline, smooth, continuous,
elliptical, ends obtuse, often 1-guttulate, 18–20×10–11µ; 1-seriate;
paraphyses septate, clavate. _Massee._

It is not uncommon to find the pileus attached in one or two points to
the stem. _Peck_, 32d Rep.

Var. _al´ba_ (Pers.) Sacc.

On decaying wood. August to frost.

Massachusetts, _Frost_; Rhode Island, _Bennett_; Nebraska, _Clements_;
New York, _Peck_, Rep. 24, 32, 51.

Edible. _Unger_, _Cordier_. Known to be edible. _Peck._


=H. in´fula= Schaeff.—a head dress. =Pileus= hooded, in 2–4 irregular,
drooping lobes, at length undulate, strongly adherent to the sides of
the stem, reddish-brown or cinnamon more or less deep in color, whitish
and downy underneath, 1.5–3 in. broad. =Stem= 1½-2½ in. long, ½ in. and
more thick, usually smooth and even, sometimes compressed and
irregularly pitted, pallid or tinged with red, covered with a white meal
or down, solid when young but becoming hollow with age; asci
cylindrical, apex somewhat truncate, 8-spored. =Spores= hyaline, smooth,
continuous, elliptical, ends obtuse, 21–23×11–12µ _Massee_.

West Virginia, Pennsylvania. Decaying trunks, stumps and roots.
_McIlvaine._

Edible. _Cooke_, _Curtis_, _Peck_.

Equal to any Helvella.


                            =VER´PA= Swartz.

                            _Verpa_, a rod.


=Ascophore= stipitate, campanulate, attached to the tip of the stem and
hanging down like a bell, surrounding but free from the side of the
stem, regular, smooth or slightly wrinkled but not ribbed, persistent,
thin, excipulum formed of interwoven, septate hyphæ, hymenium entirely
covering the outer surface of the ascophore; asci cylindrical, 8-spored.
=Spores= elliptical, continuous, hyaline or nearly so, 1-seriate;
paraphyses septate. =Stem= elongated, stuffed.

Very closely allied to Helvella; distinguished by the ascophore being
more regular in form, and more evidently deflexed round the apex of the
stem, which it surrounds like a thimble on a finger, and is quite free
from the stem except at the apex.

The species grow on the ground, in spring. _Massee._


=V. digitalifor´mis= Pers.—_digitus_, a finger. =Pileus= at first nearly
even, olivaceous-umber, dark at the apex. =Stem= obese, furnished at the
base with a few reddish radicles, white with a slight rufous tinge,
marked with transverse reddish spots; smooth to the naked eye, but under
a lens clothed with fine adpressed flocci, the rupture of which gives
rise to the spots, which are, in fact, minute scales. In the mature
plant the pileus is ¾ in. high, bell-shaped, finger-form, or subglobose,
more or less closely pressed to the stem, but always free, the edge
sometimes inflexed so as to form a white border, wrinkled, but not
reticulated, under side slightly pubescent; sporidia yellowish,
elliptic. =Stem= 3 in. high, ½ in. or more thick, slightly attenuated
downward, loosely stuffed, by no means hollow. _Berkeley._

Minnesota, _Johnson_; California, _H. and M._; New York, Buffalo,
_Clinton_; Oneida, _Warne_, May. _Peck_, 30th, 32d Rep.

Mt. Gretna, July, 1897. Road-side bank. _McIlvaine._

Sold in Italy. Vittadini. Not to be despised when one can not get better
nor to be eaten when one can. _Badham._

The substance of this fungus is the same as that of Helvella. It is
pleasant but rather tasteless.


                             =LEOTIA= Hill.


Ascophore stipitate, substance fleshy, soft and somewhat gelatinous.
=Pileus= orbicular, spreading; margin drooping or incurved free from the
stem, glabrous, hymenium entirely covering the upper surface. =Stem=
central, elongated; asci cylindric-clavate, apex narrowed, 8-spored.
=Spores= hyaline, continuous or 1-septate, elongated and narrowly
elliptical, obliquely 1–2 seriate; paraphyses present.

Growing on the ground, or on decaying wood. _Hill._ Emended. _Massee._

=Stem= long. =Pileus= flattened, margin incurved, covered everywhere
with the smooth, somewhat viscid hymenium.


=L. chloroceph´ala= Schw.—_chloros_, green; _kephalos_, a head.
Cespitose, stipitate. =Pileus= 4–6 lines across, depresso-globose,
somewhat translucent, more or less wavy, margin incurved, dark
verdigris-green to blackish-green. =Stem= 1–1½ in. long, almost equal,
green but often paler than the pileus, pulverulent, often twisted; asci
cylindric-clavate, apex rather narrowed, 8-spored. =Spores= smooth,
hyaline, narrowly elliptical, ends acute, often slightly curved, usually
2–3-guttulate, 17–20×5µ, irregularly 2-seriate; paraphyses slender,
hyaline.

On the ground.

Distinguished from L. lubrica by the green stem. _Massee._

North Carolina, _Curtis_; West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.
Cespitose. In mixed woods, moist ground. July until long after frosts.
_McIlvaine._

A small clustered plant having a green gelatinous appearance. Quarts of
it can frequently be gathered after rains. Both it and L. lubrica have
less flavor than the larger Helvellaceæ, but they make a palatable dish.


(Plate CXLVII.)

[Illustration:

  LEOTIA LUBRICA.
  Natural size.
]

=L. lu´brica=, Pers.—slippery. Gregarious or in small clusters,
stipitate, somewhat gelatinous. =Pileus= irregularly hemispherical,
inflated, wavy, margin very obtuse, yellowish olive-green, 6–8 lines
across. =Stem= 1.5–2 in. high, nearly equal or more or less inflated at
the base, pulpy within then hollow, externally yellowish and covered
with minute white granules; asci cylindrical, apex slightly narrowed,
8-spored. =Spores= obliquely 1-seriate, hyaline, continuous, smooth,
often guttulate, narrowly elliptical, straight or very slightly curved,
22–25×5–6µ; paraphyses slender, cylindrical, hyaline.

On the ground in woods. _Massee._

North Carolina, _Curtis_; Massachusetts, _Frost_; Minnesota, _Johnson_;
New York, _Ellis_.

New York, _Peck_, 23d Rep.; Trenton, N.J. Cespitose on damp ground in
woods. Forty specimens, July, 1898. _E.B. Sterling_; New Jersey;
Pennsylvania. Gregarious and cespitose in several localities. July to
frost. _McIlvaine._

Irregular in appearance. Helvella-like but with a very soft gelatinous
stem, yellow. The color of the stem distinguishes it from L.
chlorocephala, which has a green stem. It is a small plant, but of good
food value. Where it occurs there is often a goodly quantity.


                           =MORCHEL´LA= Dill.

                            _Gr_—a mushroom.


Stipitate or subsessile. =Pileus= globose or ovate, adnate throughout
its length to the sides of the stem, remaining closed at the apex,
hollow and continuous with the cavity of the stem; externally furnished
with stout, branched and anastomosing ribs or plates, every part bearing
the hymenium. =Stem= stout, stuffed or hollow; asci cylindrical,
2–4–8-spored. =Spores= 1-seriate, continuous, hyaline, elliptical;
paraphyses septate, clavate.

Most nearly allied to Gyromitra; differs in the ribs of the pileus being
deep and plate-like, and anastomosing to form elongated or irregularly
polygonal deep pits.

Growing on the ground in the spring. _Massee._

Stem stout; pileus ovoid or conical, deeply folded into pits, resembling
honeycomb.

Notwithstanding Dill, the author of the genus, describes the caps as
adnate throughout their length to the stem, such is not the case.
Professor Peck arranges the genus into two groups, “in one of which the
margin of the cap is wholly attached to the stem, in the other it is
free.” In the latter group are M. bispora and M. semilibera.

The species are so much alike that botanical descriptions are omitted of
all but M. esculenta and Professor Peck’s species.

Not one of the Morells is even suspicious. They are favorites wherever
found. The Morell is one of the few species known to the settler and to
the farmer. It loves old apple orchards, probably because ashes have
been used about the trees; ashes and cinders are its choice fertilizers.
In Germany peasants formerly burned forests to insure a bountiful crop.
Mr. Moore, of San Francisco, Cal., says: “We find it in profusion on
burnt hillsides all along the Pacific coast.”

But it does not confine its habitat to burned surfaces. It grows in thin
open woods or on borders of woods. It grows under pine, ash, oaks and
other trees. Strange to say it grows under the walnut tree where very
few fungi of any kind grow. Especially does it love the white walnut or
butternut.

Morchella dry well and keep well for winter use.


=M. esculen´ta= Pers.—esculent. (Plate XLVI, fig. 2, p. 214.) =Pileus=
globose, ovate or oblong, adnate to the stem at the base, hollow, ribs
stout, forming irregular, polygonal, deep pits, pale dingy yellow, buff
or tawny, 1.25–2.5 in. high and broad. =Stem= stout, whitish, almost
even, hollow or stuffed, 1.25–2.5 in. high, .8 in. and more thick; asci
cylindrical, 8-spored. =Spores= continuous, smooth, hyaline, elliptical,
ends obtuse, 19–20×10µ, paraphyses rather slender, slightly thickened
upward.

On the ground. Spring and early summer. Edible.

Variable in form, size and color, but distinguished by the pileus being
adnate to the stem at the base, and the stout ribs anastomosing to form
irregular, polygonal pits of about equal size, and not elongated.
_Massee._

Common over the states, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. In
orchards, on ashes and cinders, under walnut, pine and oak trees. May
and June. _McIlvaine._

The common Morell varies in size, 2–4 in. high, sometimes larger. The
cap, usually broader than it is long, oval, at times tapering to a
rounded top. The cavities resemble those of a weather-beaten honeycomb,
and are whitish, or grayish or brownish. The stem is about ½ in. in
diameter. It is an easily recognized species. Edible. Choice. Total
nitrogen, according to Lafayette B. Mendel, 4.66 per cent.


=M. cras´sipes= Pers.—_crassus_, thick; _pes_, a foot. Agreeing with M.
esculenta in having the pits of the pileus irregular in form, not much,
if at all, longer than broad, and in not having a main series of more or
less parallel and vertical ribs; differing in the stout stem being much
longer than the pileus. _Massee._

Attains a height of 9 in. or more.

Not rare in May. Kansas, _Cragin_; Minnesota, _Johnson_.

Esculent. _Cooke._


=M. delicio´sa= Fr. The Delicious morell is easily known by the shape of
its cap, which is cylindrical or nearly so. Sometimes it is slightly
narrowed toward the top and occasionally curved, as in the preceding
species, but its long narrow shape and blunt apex is quite strongly
contrasted with that species. It is usually two or three times as long
as it is broad, and generally it is longer than the stem. Specimens also
occur in which the cap is slightly more narrow in the middle than it is
above and below, and rarely it is slightly pointed at the apex. The pits
on its surface are rather narrow and mostly longer than broad. The stem
is often rather short.

The plant varies from 1½-3 in. high. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Its name gives it esculent properties.


=M. con´ica= Pers.—conical. The Conical morell has the cap conical or
oblong-conical, as its name indicates. The longitudinal ridges on its
surface run more regularly from top to base than in the Common morell.
They are connected by short transverse ridges which are so distant from
each other or so incomplete that the resulting pits or depressions are
generally longer than broad, and sometimes rather irregular. The color
in the young plant is a beautiful buff-yellow or very pale ochraceous,
but it becomes darker with age.

The plants are generally 3–5 in. high, with the cap 1½-2 in. thick in
its broadest part, and distinctly broader than the stem. _Peck_, 48th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Kansas; California; Rhode Island; Ohio, _Lloyd_; New York; Indiana,
_H.I. Miller_, orchards, thin woods; New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, _McIlvaine_.

The conical form distinguishes M. conica from M. esculenta, if they are
really different species, as some writers doubt. For the table there is
not any difference.


=M. bi´spora= Sor.—Two-spored. The Two-spored morell is very similar to
the Half-free morell in external appearance. It is distinguishable by
its cap, which is free from the stem almost or quite to the top. The
stem of the European plant has been described as stuffed, but in our
plant it is hollow, though possibly in very young plants it may be
stuffed. The remarkable and very distinctive character which gives name
to the species can only be seen by the aid of a microscope. In this
species there are only two spores in each ascus or sack and these are
much larger than the spores of the other species. They are two or three
times longer and sometimes slightly curved. The spores of the other
species are eight in an ascus and are very much alike in size and shape,
and do not furnish decided specific characters; but in this species
their importance can not be overlooked. Their length is about 60µ, while
in the others it is 20–25µ.

This is probably our rarest species. I am not aware that it has been
found in but one locality in our state. A few years ago Mr. H.A. Warne
detected it growing among fallen leaves in a ravine near Oneida. I have
not tested its edible qualities, but would have no hesitation in eating
it if opportunity should be afforded. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Var. _trunca´ta_. =Pileus= broadly rounded or truncate, its costæ
slightly prominent, the margin often a little recurved; paraphyses
numerous. =Stem= long.

Michigan. May. _Hicks._ _Peck_, 46th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


=M. angus´ticeps= Pk.—_angustus_, narrow; _caput_, head. =Pileus=
oblong-conical and subobtuse or narrowly conical and acute, adnate to
the stem, 1–2 in. high, and about half as broad at the base, ribs
longitudinal, here and there anastomosing or connected by transverse
veins. =Stem= subequal, hollow, whitish, furfuraceous without and
within, even or rarely rough with irregular longitudinal furrows; asci
cylindrical. =Spores= elliptical, whitish tinged with ocher,
20–25×12.5–18µ; paraphyses short, clavate, with one or two septa near
the base.

Sandy soil in the borders of woods and in open places. West Albany and
Center. April and May.

Two forms occur, one with the pileus oblong-conical, rather obtuse,
often tipped with a slight umbo or papilla, and with a diameter a little
surpassing that of the stem from which the base is separated by a slight
groove; the other with the pileus narrowly conical, rather acute,
scarcely exceeding the stem in diameter and without any separating
groove. The stem and fruit are alike in both forms. The stem is usually
about equal in length to the pileus. The species is related to M. conica
and M. elata, but may be separated from both by the size of the spores
and the character of the paraphyses. In our plant I have never seen
these as long as the asci. Large forms appear also to approach M.
rimosipes, but that species has the margin of the pileus more free, the
stem proportionately longer, and the paraphyses as long as the asci, if
we may rely upon the figure of it. Our plant is edible. _Peck_, 32d Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

The plants are commonly 2–3 in. high, with the cap generally less than
an inch broad in its widest part, but sometimes much larger specimens
occur. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

[Illustration: MORCHELLA SEMILIBERA.]

=M. semilib´era= D.C.—half-free. The Half-free morell has a conical cap,
the lower half of which is free from the stem. It rarely exceeds 1 in.
or 1½ in. in length, and is usually much shorter than its stem. The pits
on its surface are longer than broad. Deformed specimens occur in which
the cap is hemispherical and very blunt or obtuse at the apex; in others
it is abruptly narrowed above and pointed.

The plants are 2–4 in. high. The species is rare with us. _Peck_, 48th
Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= pale-yellow.

Odor feeble, becomes stronger in drying. Much less sapid than M.
esculenta. Neither of these funguses should be gathered after rain, as
they are then insipid and soon spoil. _Badham._


                            =GYROMI´TRA= Fr.

               _Gyro_, to turn; _mitra_, a head-covering.


Ascophore stipitate; hymenophore subglobose, inflated and more or less
hollow, or cavernous, variously gyrose and convolute at the surface,
which is everywhere covered with the hymenium; substance fleshy; asci
cylindrical, 8-spored. =Spores= uniseriate, elongated, hyaline or nearly
so, continuous; paraphyses present.

Helvella of old authors.

Distinguished from Morchella by the thick, brain-like folds of the
hymenophore not anastomosing to form irregularly polygonal depressions;
and from Helvella in the hymenophore not being free from the stem at the
base.

Growing on the ground. _Massee._

  SECTION OF GYROMITRA
  ESCULENTA.
]

=G. esculen´ta= Fr. (Plate VI, fig. 6, p. 6.) =Pileus= rounded, lobed,
irregular, gyrose-convolute, glabrous, bay-red. =Stem= stout, stuffed or
hollow, whitish, often irregular. =Spores= elliptical, binucleate,
yellowish, 20–22µ long.

The Edible gyromitra, formerly known as Helvella esculenta, is easily
recognized by its chestnut-red irregularly rounded and lobed cap with
its brain-like convolutions. The margin of the cap is attached to the
stem in two or three places. When cut through it is found to be hollow,
whitish within and uneven, with a few prominent irregular ribs or
ridges. The stem is whitish, slightly scurfy, and when mature, hollow.
In large specimens it sometimes appears as if formed by the union of two
or more smaller ones.

The plant is 2–4 in. high and the cap commonly 2–3 in. broad. Specimens
sometimes occur weighing a pound each. It is fond of sandy soil and is
found in May and June. It grows chiefly in wet weather or in wet ravines
or springy places in the vicinity of pine groves or pine trees. _Peck_,
48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

G. esculenta crispa n. var. Whole surface of the pileus finely
reticulated with anastomosing costæ (ribs or veins).

Under evergreens. North Elba. June. _Peck_, 51st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Since 1882 myself and friends have repeatedly eaten it. In no instance
was the slightest discomfort felt from it. It was always enjoyed. Mr.
Charles H. Allen, San Jose, Cal., writes to me that G. esculenta grows
plentifully in his region, and that it is not only edible, but he has
found it one of the best. But the species, though long ago esteemed
highly in Europe and by many in America, now rests under decided
suspicion. It is not probable that in our great food-giving country
anyone will be narrowed to G. esculenta for a meal. Until such an
emergency arrives, the species would be better let alone.


=G. cur´tipes= Fr.—_curtus_, short; _pes_, a foot. =Pileus= inflated,
gyrosely undulated, oblong, rotund, at first pallid then brownish;
margin of pileus closely adnexed to the stem. =Stem= irregular, short or
almost absent. =Asci= cylindrical. =Sporidia= .30×9µ fusiform,
uninucleate. Paraphyses clavate.

On the ground. Spring. Readily distinguished from other species by the
almost obliterated stem. Fries commends it highly as an esculent.

Separated from G. esculenta by paler color, shorter stem and different
spores.


=G. Carolinia´na= (Bosc.) Fr. =Pileus= rotund, base free, surface woven
into deep irregular undulating folds. =Stem= conical, sulcate. =Asci=
cylindrical. =Sporidia= 3–3.2×1µ; somewhat fusiform; paraphyses
thickened toward the top.

In woods. Esculent.

Massachusetts. _Sprague._


(Plate CXLVIII.)

[Illustration: GYROMITRA BRUNNEA.]

=G. brun´nea= Underwood—_brunneus_, brown. A stout, fleshy, stipitate
plant, 3–5 in. high, bearing a broad, much contorted, brown ascoma.
=Stem= ¾-1.5 in. thick, more or less enlarged and spongy, solid at the
base, hollow below, rarely slightly fluted, clear white; receptacle 2–4
in. across in the widest direction, the two diameters usually
considerably unequal, irregularly lobed and plicate, in places faintly
marked into areas by indistinct anastomosing ridges, closely cohering
with the stem in the various parts, rich chocolate-brown or somewhat
lighter if much covered with the leaves among which it grows, whitish
underneath; asci 8-spored. =Spores= oval, 28–30µ long, by about 14µ
wide, hyaline, somewhat roughened-tuberculate, usually nucleate, the
highly refractive nucleus spherical or oval, 11µ or, if oval, 14×11µ in
diameter; paraphyses slender, enlarged at the apex, faintly septate.

In rich woods, mostly in beech-leaf mold. Putnam county, Ind., May,
1892, 1893 and 1894. First found by Dr. W.V. Brown.

The plant is esculent, tender and possesses a fine flavor. Often as many
as 8 or 10 plants would be found in one small area, but the plant
appears to be local and never very abundant. Some single plants would
weigh nearly half a pound.


                             =MI´TRULA= Fr.

                          (Emended, _Massee_.)


Ascophore stipitate, fleshy. =Head= subglobose, ovate, or clavate, even,
glabrous, everywhere covered with the hymenium, adnate throughout to the
more or less elongated stem; asci cylindric-clavate, 8-spored. =Spores=
narrowly elliptic-fusiform, hyaline, continuous or septate, irregularly
1–2-seriate; paraphyses present. _Fries._

[Illustration: MITRULLA VITELLINA.]

=M. vitelli´na= Sacc., var. _irregularis_ Pk.—_vitellus_, egg-yolk.
=Pileus= clavate, often irregular or compressed and somewhat lobed,
obtuse, glabrous, yellow, tapering below into the short, rather
distinct, yellowish or whitish stem. =Spores= narrowly elliptical, 8–10µ
long.

When the Irregular mitrula is well grown and symmetrical it closely
resembles the typical European plant, but usually the clubs or caps are
curved, twisted, compressed or lobed in such a way that it is difficult
to find two plants just alike. The plants are usually only one or two
inches high, so that they would scarcely be thought of any importance as
an edible species. But sometimes it grows in considerable profusion in
wet mossy places in woods, so that it would not be difficult to gather a
pint of them in a short time. Its beautiful bright yellow color makes it
a very attractive object. It is our largest species of Mitrula and
occurs in autumn.

It was first reported as an edible species in the forty-second report.
Its flesh is tender and its flavor delicate and agreeable. _Peck_, 48th
Rep.

Ontario, _Dearness_ (LI. R. 4). West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.
Common, gregarious in moist woods. September to November. _McIlvaine._

Those fortunate enough to find this species will hunt for it again
assiduously. Even raw, when cut in strips, it makes a picturesque and
delicious salad.

                               A spatula.


Receptacle erect, spathulate, compressed, hollow, adnate to the stem,
down which it runs for some distance on opposite sides, everywhere
covered with the hymenium. =Stem= subcylindrical, hollow; asci clavate,
apex narrowed, 8-spored. =Spores= elongated, cylindric-clavate,
multi-septate at maturity, arranged in a parallel fascicle in the ascus;
paraphyses filiform, septate.

Distinguished by the broad, flattened ascophore running down opposite
sides of the stem.

Growing on pine leaves or on the ground among moss. _Massee._

Resembling a spatha, an instrument for stirring a liquid, shaped like an

clavate, obtuse or sometimes more or less divided at the apex, hollow,
much compressed, running down the stem for some distance on opposite
sides, glabrous, margin crisped or undulated, surface wavy or slightly
lacunose, yellow, rarely tinged red, .8–1.2 in. high, .6–1 in. broad.
=Stem= white then tinged yellow, 1.2–2.4 in. long, .2–3 lines thick,
hollow, cylindrical or slightly compressed; asci clavate, apex narrowed,
8-spored. =Spores= arranged in a parallel fascicle, hyaline,
linear-clavate, usually very slightly bent, multiguttulate then
multiseptate, 50–60×3.5–4µ; paraphyses filiform, septate, often
branched, tips not thickened, wavy. _Massee._

New York. Woods in hilly and mountainous districts. Common. _Peck_, 22d

Professor Peck gives S. rugosa, which has the club wrinkled.

This odd, pretty little plant was found by me in great numbers at
Eagle’s Mere, Pa., August, 1897, growing among mosses. The contrast of
its bright yellow paddle-shapes against the moss-green is very pleasing
to one who loves choice bits of color. Its consistency when stewed is
tenacious but tender, and its flavor is delicate.

tinged brown), elliptical, epispore smooth or rough; paraphyses present.
_Dill._ Emended. _Massee._

The genus is large. Professor Peck reports 150 American species. Some
are large, others require the microscope to find them.

They are rather indiscriminate in their habitats; some are eccentric;
these grow on damp walls, on dung, in cellars and cisterns, on spent
hops and on old fungi. One or two species grow on sticks under water, an
unusual place for fungi of any kind. Minute species grow upon stems of
herbaceous plants; nine or ten upon the nettle. Two species contain a
milky fluid, P. succosa and P. saniosa. Many are known in Europe which
have not been found in America. European authors differ as to their
qualities; some call them insipid, some speak of them with kindly
respect. Much depends upon their cooking. They are, as a rule, tenacious
in texture. To cook them properly requires time and slow stewing. They
then become soft and rather glutinous. Their flavor is slight but
pleasant, and their consistency agreeable.

P. badia is frequent on bare ground, along wood roads, etc. In the West
Virginia mountains it occurs where there have been brush fires. It is a
meaty plant, without much flavor. It must be cut fine and slowly cooked
if stewed, or can be quickly fried in a hot buttered pan. It has more
flavor fried crisp than stewed.


=P. cochlea´ta=—spiral. Sessile, cespitose, variously contorted and
plicate, fleshy, brittle, disk umber-brown, externally paler and
pruinose, sometimes altogether paler and leather-color or pale
dingy-ochraceous, 2–3.2 in. diameter; when solitary or almost so, at
first globose, then expanding with the margin involute, finally
spreading and irregularly plicate; excipulum spongy and cavernous, due
to the loose weft formed by interlacing, hyaline, thin-walled, flaccid,
septate hyphæ, cortex compact, running out into irregular groups of
cells that form the scurfy exterior; asci cylindrical, apex slightly
truncate, 8-spored. =Spores= obliquely 1-seriate, hyaline, continuous,
smooth, usually 2-guttulate, 16–18×7–8µ; paraphyses slender, septate;
tip slightly clavate, often curved and sometimes branched.

The entire substance is brittle and rather watery, and usually assumes a
yellowish tint when bruised. Smell and taste almost none.

Sometimes the ascophores are closely crowded, hence irregular and much
contorted, and resembling a foliaceous Tremella or a small specimen of
Sparassis crispa. _Massee._

growing singly and then circular in outline and regular, becoming almost
plane; thin, brittle, disk clear, deep orange or sometimes orange-red,
externally much paler, or sometimes almost white, with a pink tinge,

=P. odora´ta= Pk. =Cups= .5–3 in. broad, gregarious or scattered, thin,
sessile, rather brittle when fresh, shallow, expanded or even convex
from the decurving of the margin, at first brownish, then white or
whitish, the hymenium ochraceous-brown; asci cylindrical, opening by a
lid, .01-.012 in. long, .0006-.0008 in. broad, paraphyses filiform,
obscurely septate, slightly thickened at the tips. =Spores= elliptical,
even, 20–22.2×10–12.5µ.

Ground in cellar. Maine. June. _F.L. Harvey._

The plant when fresh has the peculiar fungoid flavor suggestive of that
of chestnut blossoms. The species is apparently allied to P. Petersii,
from which it may be distinguished by its larger spores and distinct but
peculiar odor. The spores also are not binucleate, as in that species.
In drying, the hymenium is apt to become blackish. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey
Bot. Club, Vol. 23, No. 10.

A cluster 4 inches across, in general appearance resembling P. repanda,
was found by the writer at Mt. Gretna, Pa., June, 1898, growing from
between the staves of an empty flour barrel which was exposed to the
weather. The margin, instead of being revolute, turned inward (involute)
until it touched the short stem. The cluster was eaten and had the
flavor of P. repanda. In June, 1899, several pounds grew on and around
the same barrel. Professor Peck recognized it as P. odorata.


=P. cocci´nea= Jacq.—scarlet or crimson. Geopyxis coccinea Mass. (Plate
CXXXVI, fig. 2, p. 508.) Scattered or in groups of 2–3 specimens,
stipitate; at first closed, then expanding and becoming shallowly
cup-shaped, margin entire, .8–1.6 in. across; disk clear and deep
carmine, externally whitish or pinkish, delicately tomentose, due to the
presence of wavy, usually aseptate, hyaline, cylindrical hyphæ, 5–6µ
thick. =Stem= .4-.8 in. long, 1.2–2 in. thick, whitish and tomentose.
=Spores= 1-seriate, elliptic-oblong, ends obtuse, hyaline, wall rather
thick and forming a hyaline border, straight, 25–30×8–9µ; paraphyses
very slender, hardly thickened at the tips.

On rotten branches lying on the ground. Spring.

Readily distinguished among the large, stipitate Pezizæ by the deep
rose-red or carmine disk and the whitish, tomentose exterior. The stem
varies considerably in length; when the fungus springs from the
underside of a branch the stem is often elongated and curved. The base
of the stem is attached to the branch by a mass of whitish, tomentose
mycelium. _Massee._

Jersey, _E.B. Sterling_; Mt. Gretna, Pa., New Jersey. On sticks on

This brilliant fungus is one of the beauties of the woods. Though small
it attracts the eye by its deep carmine in striking contrast with the
somber carpeting. It is frequent when in season. A half pint of it may
be gathered from a few acres. Its substance is tenacious, taste
pleasant. Mr. Massee mentions that it is abundant in some of the woods
near Scarboro, England, and is regularly collected and sold along with
moss for decorative purposes. Exquisite effects may be produced by
arranging the brightly colored fungi among moss and leaves. “Fairy
Cups,” they are called. Rosy must be the lips that do not pale beside
them.


=P. calyci´na= Schum.—resembling a bud. Ascophores cespitose, gregarious
or scattered, narrowed into a short, stout, stem-like base, rather
fleshy, 1–3 mm. broad; disk orange-yellow, externally white and villose,
hairs rather wavy, cylindrical, obtuse, colorless, minutely rough,
100–150×4–5µ; asci subcylindrical, apex obtuse, 8-spored. =Spores=
1-seriate or inclined to be 2-seriate above, hyaline, elliptic-fusiform,
continuous, 18–25×6–8µ; paraphyses slender, hyaline, cylindrical.

Perithecia (the hollow narrow-mouthed cases which contain the spores)
gregarious, with a cottony stroma in which they are more or less
immersed. Mostly parasitic on various Hymenomycetes or Discomycetes;
bright colored, with papilliform (nipple-shaped) or slightly elongated
ostiola (apertures). Asci mostly cylindrical, 8-spored, without
paraphyses. Sporidia oblong or fusoid, uniseptate, hyaline. Conidial
stage represented by Asterophora, etc.

This parasite attacks several species of fungi, and so alters their
structure and appearance that it is difficult to distinguish the
host-plant. The attack is made in the extreme youth of the plant. The
writer is fully satisfied from his own observation that H. lactifluorum
and H. purpurea infest Lactarius piperatus. The milk cells are so
changed by H. lactifluorum that they yield no milk. When attacked by H.
purpurea the milk is a beautiful purple. In both cases the pepperiness
of the host-plant is destroyed. I have seen the same host plant attacked
by both forms of the Hypomyces. After the host-plant of Hypomyces
lactifluorum is fully grown, and infested, it is frequently attacked by
Hypomyces purpureus. Purple spots appear, which gradually spread until
the entire plant is covered. This Hypomyces seems to affect the milk
cells. A beautiful, profuse, purple fluid results.

The parasite is proving itself an enemy to fungi, but a friend to man.
Upon L. piperatus and upon Amanita rubescens it very much adds to the
weight of the plants, and improves the texture and edible qualities. The
same may be said of L. volemus, but not to such a degree. Prof. M.W.
Easton in August, 1899, found this species at Mt. Gretna, Pa., attacked
by a parasitic fungus in such a manner as to destroy its milk-giving
quality and completely transform its gills into a corrugated, granular
surface.

Professor Peck, to whom I submitted the parasite, thinks it a new
species and calls it H. volemi.

Further study of Hypomyces and its effect upon fungi, and of the
particular host-plants is desirable.


=H. lac´tifluorum= (Schw.) Tulasne—_lac_, milk; _fluorum_, flowing.
(Plate CXXXVI, fig. 5, p. 508.) Asci long and slender, sporidia in one
row, spindle-shaped, straight or slightly curved, rough, hyaline,
uniseptate, cuspidate-pointed at the ends, 30–38×6–8µ.

The general appearance is much the same as that of H. aurantius (Pers.)
Tul., but the sporidia are larger, rough and warted, and the felt-like
mycelium is wanting.

In the affected species of Lactarius the gills are entirely obliterated,
so that the hymenium of the agaric presents an even, orange-colored
surface on which the subglobose perithecia are thickly bedded, with only
their slightly prominent reddish ostiola visible. In decay the color
changes to a purplish-red.

On Lactarius, especially L. piperatus.

This fungus puzzled me for many years. August, 1896, I sent several
specimens to Professor Peck of different colors—orange, red, whitish and
purple.

Professor Peck kindly identified the specimens and wrote: “In one the
matrix of the host-plant has not been so completely changed or
transformed as in the other. It would be interesting to know what
species of Lactarius it is that Hypomyces attacks. I have never been
able to ascertain, and have sometimes thought it might be Cantharellus
cibarius, but this specimen of yours indicates, rather, a Lactarius.”

Of the purple specimen he wrote: “This is a beautiful thing, and as I
find nothing like it described I have given it a name—Hypomyces
purpureus Peck.”

Well cooked, in small pieces, it is one of the very best.


=H. purpu´reus= Pk.—_purpureus_, purple. Subiculum effused, purple,
permeating, transforming and discoloring the matrix; perithecia minute,
sunk in the subiculum, the ostiola emergent, black; asci cylindrical;
spores fusiform, uniseptate, purple, with a cusp-like point at each end,
35–40µ long, 7.5µ broad, oozing out and forming beautiful purple masses
or patches on the surface of the matrix.

Pennsylvania. August. _Charles McIlvaine._

The species is similar in all respects to H. lactifluorum, except in
color. It is apparently parasitic on some species of Lactarius, but the
host plant is so transformed and discolored that the species is not
recognizable. _Peck_, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, Vol. 25, No. 6.

H. purpureus Pk. was sent by the writer to Professor Peck in August,
1897, who wrote: “This is a beautiful thing and as I find nothing like
it described, I have given it a name.”

Of itself H. purpureus is a minute parasitic fungus as above described.
But it possesses the power of so altering the structure—changing form,
shape and appearance—of the fungus upon which it has taken its abode
that the host-plant, be it Cantharellus cibarius, Craterellus
cantharellus or one of the Lactari, or whatever the species, becomes
difficult to recognize, so that it is not yet certain upon which species
it is parasitic. It may be upon many.

The present plant seems to be parasitic upon one of the Lactarii. It
therefore becomes necessary to describe the host as it appears when
possessed by the parasite. The plant is variable in shape from an
irregular nodule to a distorted-capped, short-stemmed mass, 2–4 in.
across, 1–3 in. high, hard, brittle, coarse in appearance and rough to
the touch; deep orange, wholly or in part stained with a beautiful
purple. The purple juice exudes and dyes everything with which it comes
in contact. The growth is very heavy for its size.

To all appearances it is the same host as is attacked by Hypomyces
lactifluorum, resembling it in every particular excepting in the purple
stain and juice.

It is frequent in open oak and chestnut woods, but prefers oak. It grows
from among leaves or from grassy spots. August to October.

While it is beautiful in its coloring it is not inviting in appearance
as an edible. Yet sliced, cut small and stewed for twenty minutes it is
one of the very best fungi I have eaten.


=H. vole´mi= Pk. Subiculum very thin, whitish or isabelline; perithecia
minute, brown, nestling in the subiculum; asci very slender, 100–125µ
long, sporiferous part 4µ broad. =Spores= oblong-fusiform, 12–15µ long,
4µ broad, commonly binucleate.

Parasitic on the hymenium of Lactarius volemus. Pennsylvania. _Charles
McIlvaine._

The hymenium of the host plant is changed in appearance by the parasite,
but the stem and upper surface of the pileus remain unchanged. _Peck_,
Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, 27, January, 1900.

The edible qualities are in nowise affected by the parasite.

Subterranean; ascophore irregularly globose, usually large, not

To this family belongs the Truffle of commerce renowned for its
flavoring qualities. It has not yet been found in America, though
several fungi are ignorantly bought in our markets under that name;
notably Coprinus comatus or maned mushroom. The writer has frequently
been informed with all the logical force of genuine market-women that
this was the real Truffle, because they raised it themselves.

Until quite recently but one species of Truffle has been reported as
growing in America. This, Tuber niveum Desf. or Terfezia leonis Tul. was
found by Rev. A.B. Langlois, St. Martinville, La. He reported it as
growing plentifully, buried or nearly so in the red sand land along the
Red river near Natchitoches. He writes me: “The people where it is found
are looking for it with great care and are eating it with great relish.
I had occasion to eat it once and I found it delicious.” He kindly sent
the original illustration from which the accompanying drawing was made.
It was taken from Jour. Myc., January, 1887, J. B. Ellis, who first
published a description of the American representative of the species.
He describes it as “subglobose, up to full two inches in diameter,
strongly plicate or furrowed below, nearly smooth and pale reddish-brown
outside, marbled-white within and of compact texture much like a potato,
but softer. When first dug from the ground the color is pure white, the
reddish tint being due to exposure to the air. The asci obovate or
subglobose, 75–80×60–70µ. Each contains eight globose spores, thickly
clothed with obtuse, elongated, wart-like tubercles and about 20µ in
diameter. The home of the white Truffle is said to be in Northern
Africa, though it is not uncommon in Southern Europe, where its growth
is favored by mild winters.”

It is probable that the Truffle will be found in other southern states.
Perhaps in the north, as Fries reports that two specimens were found
near Linkoping, Sweden, and Mr. H.W. Harkness reports Tubers in the
Sierras at the height of 7,000 feet. It is worth hunting for.

It is possible that the common Truffle—Tuber æstivum—will be found in
America. Fame awaits the finder. A description of it with illustration
is therefore given.


(Plate CLIV.)

[Illustration:

=Tuber æsti´vum= Vitt. Peridium warty, of a blackish-brown color, the
warts polygonal and striate; flesh transversed by numerous veins; asci
4–6-spored; spores elliptical, reticulated.

This plant, the common Truffle of our markets, is abundant in Wiltshire
and some other parts of England, and probably occurs in many places
where it escapes observation from its subterranean habit. _Badham._

It is cultivated largely in France. “Perigord Truffles” are a costly
delicacy. The Truffle is of subterranean habit, growing under various
kinds of trees and from 12–48 in. under ground. As it does not manifest
its presence above ground, dogs and pigs are trained to find it by
scent. An interesting chapter on Truffles will be found in British
Edible Fungi, M.C. Cooke, 1891. Any plant of similar habit, when found,
should be immediately sent by the finder to a known expert for
identification.

Thirteen species of Tuber and several Terfeziæ are reported in
California, and are described and beautifully illustrated in “California
Hypogæous Fungi” by H.W. Harkness, “Proceedings of the California
Academy of Sciences,” 1899.

Terfezia spinosa Harkness closely resembles T. leonis Tul., and T.
(sphærotuber) Californicum n. sp., found under oaks beneath vegetable
humus in Alameda county, Cal., Professor Harkness remarks, is nearly
identical with an edible species found in Italy. All species found in
California are said to be edible, but to be too rare to be of food
value.

There is a well known growth, found from New Jersey south to the Gulf
and west to Kansas, called Tuckahoe (Pachyma cocos), (Plate CLV), an
Indian name meaning a round loaf or cake, and famed for its edible
qualities. Its exact place in plant growth has been variously
determined. It is now conceded that it is the sclerotium or cellular
reservoir of reserve material of some fungus. It is usually found
attached to the roots of trees, in low marshy places. It grows several
feet below the surface, and to the size of a man’s head. It varies in
shape, being oblong or round, having a coarse brown covering, looking
like a cocoanut. Its interior is white, compact, without cellular
structure; it has no mycelium or trace of fructification. It contains as
high as 77 per cent. of pectose and is therefore highly nutritious.

For full accounts see Torrey Bulletin, October, 1882; Smithsonian Inst.
Rep., 1881, p. 693; article by Professor J. Howard Gore; also Garden and
Forest, IX, p. 302.

The illustration is after that in the Century Dictionary, “Tuckahoe.”

As has been stated, the two Cohorts in which a hymenium or spore-bearing
surface is present are called Hymenomycetes and Gastromycetes. In the
first the hymenium is exposed, as in the common mushroom. In the
second—Gastromycetes—the hymenium is at first enclosed in a sac or
peridium, as in the common puff-ball.

The botanical description of Gastromycetes, given by M.C. Cooke, is:
“Hymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in most cases
of closely-packed cells, of which the fertile ones bear naked spores on
distinct spicules, exposed only by the rupture or decay of the insisting
coat or peridium.’

The Gastromycetes are usually large, ground-growing fungi. A few grow
upon wood. The peridium is of dense structure, usually globose and of
considerable thickness. It commonly consists of two layers. These form
the sac holding the spore-bearing structure, which is called the gleba.
The gleba consists of innumerable chambers or cells, curved and
branched, and only to be distinguished by magnifying. The primary
structure is retained in some species throughout the life of the plants,
excepting changes due to growth and maturing, or in others these cells
or chambers are large and few, and form distinct peridiola, which
contain the spores.

The maturing of the plant and the consequent changes in the gleba is
accompanied by various transformations of the peridium.”

It is impossible within the scope of this book to even name all the
genera of Gastromycetes. Professor Morgan’s table of the families and
table of the genera of Lycoperdaceæ are here given. The orders are
defined as are some of the genera, and the edible species are described.

Receptacle composed of obliquely anastomosing bars and stipitate.

                              5. LATERNEA.

Receptacle composed of a few vertical columns and sessile.

The following synoptical tables will exhibit the prominent distinctive
features of the species of Phallus of this state (New York) and the
United States, so far as I am able to get them from the published
descriptions and the specimens at my command.

     _Peck_, 32d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


                           I.—HYMENOPHAL´LUS.

An indusium or veil surrounding the stipe and dependent from its apex
beneath the pileus.

            a. _Veil reticulate, hanging below the pileus._

=P. Dæ´monum= Rumph. =Volva= globose, not very thick, pinkish; segments
3 or 4, irregular. =Stem= cylindric, tapering at each end, cellulose;
the veil reticulate, somewhat expanded and bell-shaped, hanging nearly
to the middle of the stem. =Pileus= bell-shaped, somewhat oblique; the
surface reticulate-pitted after deliquescence; the apex truncate,
smooth, perforate. =Spores= elliptic-oblong, 4×2µ.

=Plant= 9 in. high. =Volva= 2 in. in diameter. =Stem= 1⅛ in. thick at
the middle. =Pileus= 2 in. in height; the lower edge of the veil hangs
about 4 in. from the apex of the stem. The short veil and the smooth
ring at the apex will distinguish this species from the next. _Morgan._

Growing on the ground in woods.

Ohio, _Morgan_, _Lea_; Maryland, _Miss Banning_; New York, _Peck_.

Mt. Gretna, ground in mixed woods, August, 1899. _McIlvaine._

Several specimens were found; but two in the early or ovum stage. In
this condition the species is edible. Quality same as P. impudicus.


=P. duplica´tus= Bosc. =Volva= depressed globose, thick, flabby white;
segments 3–5, acute. =Stipe= fusiform-cylindric cellulose; the veil
reticulate, hanging down to the volva, sometimes much expanded, often
torn and shreddy with pieces adherent to the stipe. =Pileus=
campanulate, reticulate-pitted after deliquescence; the apex acute, not
regularly perforate. =Spores= elliptic-oblong, 4×2µ.

=Plant= 6–8 in. high. =Volva= 2½ in. in diameter. =Stipe= 1¼ in. thick
in the middle. =Pileus= 2 in. in height. The long veil usually clings
close to the stipe though sometimes swinging free and much expanded. In
this species the gleba extends over the apex and there is no thick
smooth ring encircling the perforation as in the preceding species (P.
Dæmonum). _Morgan._

Growing in woods about old stumps and rotten logs. West Virginia, in
woods, along mountain trails; Mt. Gretna, Pa., in mixed woods, summer.
_McIlvaine._

In the forests of the West Virginia mountains, P. duplicatus is
frequent. Before rupture of the volva the plant is a semi-gelatinous
mass, tenacious and elastic. It has little taste or smell. Cut in slices
and fried, or stewed, it is a tender, agreeable food.

        _b. Veil not reticulate, concealed beneath the pileus._


=P. Ravenel´ii= B. and C. =Volva= subglobose or ovoid, pinkish; with an
inner membrane, the lower half of the veil surrounding the base of the
stem; segments 2 or 3. =Stem= cylindric, tapering at each end,
cellulose; the veil membranous, scarcely half as long as the pileus and
concealed beneath it. =Pileus= conico-bell-shaped; the surface not
reticulate-pitted after deliquescence; the apex smooth and closed or
finally perforate. =Spores= elliptic-oblong, 4–5×2µ.

=Plant= 5–7 in. high. =Volva= 1½-2 in. in diameter. =Stem= nearly 1 in.
thick. =Pileus= 1½ in. in height. This species vitiates the genus
Dictyophora and it can not very well be placed in Ithyphallus.

Growing in woods and fields about rotting stumps and logs. _Morgan._

South Carolina, _Ravenel_; Ohio, _Morgan_; New York, _Peck_.


         II.—ITHYPHAL´LUS Fischer. (_Gr_—erect; _Gr_—phallus.)

Stipe without an indusium or veil dependent from its apex. _Morgan._


=P. impudi´cus= Linn. (Plate CLVIII.) =Volva= globose or ovoid, white or
pinkish; segments 2 or 3. =Stem= cylindric, tapering at each end,
cellulose, without a veil. =Pileus= conic-campanulate; the surface
reticulate pitted after deliquescence, the apex smooth, at first closed,
at length perforate. =Spores= elliptic-oblong, 4–5×2µ.

Growing on the ground in woods.

=Plant= 6–8 in. high. =Volva= 2 in. in diameter. =Stem= 1¼ in. thick.
=Pileus= 2 in. in height.

By the elongation of the stem the thin membrane which separates the
stipe from the pileus is torn into shreds and the pileus is thus
liberated from the stipe except at the apex. _Morgan._

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Summer and autumn. _McIlvaine._

P. impudicus makes itself known wherever it grows. The stench of the
full-grown plant is aggravatingly offensive, attracting blow-flies in
quantities, and the carrion beetle Necrophorus Americanus. It is common
over the United States, in woods, open fence corners, along road-sides,
but a favorite abode is in kitchen yards and under wooden steps, where,
when mature, it will compel the household to seek it in self-defense. It
is a beautiful plant.

When in the egg-shape it is white or light dull-green, semi-gelatinous,
tenacious and elastic. As many as a dozen sometimes grow in a bunch,
each from a peculiar white, cord-like root or mycelium. They look, when
young, like bubbles of some thick substance. In this condition they are
very good when fried. They demand to be eaten at this time, if at any.




                        GENUS II.—=MUTI´NUS= Fr.


=Stipe= hollow within, the wall composed of a single layer of
round-celled tissue. =Pileus= wholly adnate to the summit of the stipe,
the gleba occupying its outer surface. _Morgan._

Distinguished from Ithyphallus by the cap being adnate to the
receptacle.


(Plate CLIX.)

[Illustration:

  MUTINUS CANINUS.
  (After Massee and Morgan.)
]

=M. cani´nus= Fr. (_Phallus caninus_ Berk.; _Phallus inodorus_ Sow.)
=Receptacle= elongato-fusiform, cellular, white or rosy. =Pileus= short,
subacute, rugulose, red. =Spores= cylindrical, involved in green mucus,
3–5×2µ.

In woods and bushy places. Sporophore from ½-¾ in. before the volva is
ruptured. When fully evolved 3–4 in. high. Sometimes scentless, at
others with a distinct odor, but never so strong and disagreeable as in
Ithyphallus impudicus. _Massee._

=Spores= elliptic, 6×4µ _Morgan_; 3–5×2µ _Massee_.

New England, _Frost_; New York, _Warne_; West Virginia, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, _McIlvaine_.

This species is common. Few old woods are without it. It is conspicuous
in color among the brown of the forest carpet. The plant has not the
mal-odor of its relations, but is not pleasant. In the egg shape it is
gelatinous, tenacious, rather firm, edible and good when sliced and
fried.


=M. bovi´nus= Morg. =Volva= oblong-ovoid, pinkish, segments 2 or 3.
=Stem= cylindric, tapering gradually to the apex, white or pinkish
below, bright red above. =Pileus= indeterminate, conic-acuminate,
perforate at the apex. =Spores= elliptic-oblong, 4–5×2µ.

=Plant= 4–7 in. in height, the stem ¾ of an in. in thickness, the volva
not much thicker and 1–1½ in. in height; the pileus occupies 1–2 in. of
the pointed apex, but is not definitely limited below. This plant has
the strong disagreeable odor of other Phalloids.

Growing in rich soil in cultivated grounds and in woods. _Morgan._

Common in mixed woods, West Virginia, Pennsylvania. Smell strong, but
not so offensive as P. impudicus. Edible in the egg-shape.


=M. brevis= B. and C.—short. =Volva= globose or ovoid, segments 2 or 3.
=Stem= bright red, coarsely cribrose, attenuated below. =Pileus=
somewhat broadly clavate, sometimes conical, but always more or less
obtuse, perforate at the apex.

=Plant= 2–3 in. high. =Stem= 4–5 lines thick, the volva ¾ of an in. in
diameter, the pileus sometimes half as long as the stem.

Growing on the ground in fields and gardens. _Morgan._

North Carolina, _Curtis_; South Carolina, _Ravenel_; New England,
_Wright_; New York, _Howe_, _Gerard_, _Peck_.


In the remaining genera, Clathrus, Simblum, Laternea, no species have
been reported as tested.

                      FAMILY II.—=LYCOPERDA´CEÆ.=

Peridium sessile, usually with a more or less thickened base or
sometimes stipitate, at maturity filled with a dusty mass of mingled
threads and spores.

This order contains many of our most delicious and important food
species. The characteristics of all genera are given. In several of them
no species are reported edible, but it is more than probable that all
are. The genera are therefore given in this table, but are omitted in
place to save room. The omitted genera are Nos. 1, Polyplocium; 2,
Batarrea; 3, Myriostoma; 5, Astreus; 6, Mitremyces.

                       _Gr_—the earth; _Gr_—star.


Mycelium filamentous or fibrous, much branched and interwoven with the
soil. Peridium subglobose, composed of two distinct persistent coats;
outer peridium thick, fleshy-coriaceous, at first closely investing the
inner, but discrete (distinct) at maturity splitting from the apex
downward into several segments which become reflexed; inner peridium
thin, membranaceous then papyraceous (like parchment), sessile or with a
short pedicel, dehiscent at the apex by a single mouth. Capillitium
taking its origin from the inner surface of the peridium and also from a

long, slender, thickest in the middle and tapering to each extremity,
fixed at one end and free at the other. =Spores= small, globose,
minutely warted, brown. _Morgan._

(Plate CLX.)

[Illustration:

  GEASTER HYGROMETRICUS.
  Natural size. (After Morgan.)
]

G. minimus, when found by the writer, was not tested because not found
in condition. It is a plant beautiful in its oddity. Its seven to nine
outer segments of skin loosen at the bottom, spring up, raising the oval
body of the plant with them, turn their points down and balance on the
lower points, and look, in miniature, just as would two sectional orange
peels spread at their loose points if one was rested, point to point,
upon the other. This hoisting of the spore-bearing part aloft, that it
may better eject its spores to the wind, does not seem to have been
noted by Professor Morgan. Specimens sent to Professor Peck by the
writer beautifully illustrated this enterprise of the plant.


=G. hygrome´tricus= Pers. (Plate CLX, 2 figs., p. 580.) Peridium
depressed-globose, the cuticle deciduous with the mycelium; outer
peridium deeply parted, the segments 7–20, strongly hygrometric, acute
at the apex; inner peridium depressed-globose, sessile, reticulate,
pitted, whitish becoming gray or brownish; the mouth an irregularly
lacerate aperture. Threads of the capillitium rather thinner than the
spores, hyaline. =Spores= globose, minutely warted, brown, 8–11µ in. in
diameter.

Growing in fields and woods in sandy soil. A very common species found
everywhere in the world. Inner peridium ¾-1 in. in diameter, the
segments expanding to a breadth of 2–3 in. The inner layer of the outer
peridium is cartilaginous-gelatinous, hard and rigid when dry, swelling
greatly and flexible when wet though constantly becoming more and more
cracked and fissured, it retains its hygroscopic qualities a long time,
and the outer peridium remains lying on the soil, stellate in shape,
spreading out its rays in moist weather and bending them inward in dry.
_Morgan._

Mr. Morgan made a new genus—Astræus, in which he placed this species. It
is so widely known as Geaster hygrometricus that to avoid confusion it
is placed in its old genus.

This natural barometer, spreading its stellate covering on the soil
about it when the air is laden with moisture, and closing it around its
puffy body when humidity is absent, is odd and interesting. The entire
genus is more or less gifted with this weather-wise quality. The species
is very common, but seldom found in number. Once, in the West Virginia
mountains, 1882, I found a large patch of it, and was able to collect
from it enough young ones to test its edibility. It is difficult to find
before it bursts its outer coat. When young it is, when cooked, soft and
creamy inside. The outer part is tough and semi-glutinous but of
pleasant texture. It has not a marked flavor, but makes a succulent
dish.

[Illustration:

  TYLOSTOMA
  MEYENIANUM.
  (After Morgan.)
]

Plants growing on the ground, oftenest in dry and sandy regions. The
genus is readily distinguished from all others of the Lycoperdaceæ by
the entire peridium being mounted upon the apex of the stem. _Morgan._

The genus contains but few species. Those I have found were not in
condition to test. There is no report upon the edibility of any.




                      GENUS VIII.—=CALVA´TIA= Fr.


Mycelium fibrous, usually thick and cord-like, rooting from the base.
=Peridium= large, globose and nearly sessile, or turbinate with a
well-developed base; cortex a very thin adherent layer, often smooth and
continuous, sometimes composed of minute spinules or granules; inner
peridium a loosely woven and very fragile covering, after maturity
breaking up into fragments from above downward and gradually falling
away. Subgleba cellulose, mostly definitely limited and concave above,
persistent; mass of spores and capillitium dense, compact, persistent a
long time and slowly dissipating after the fracture of the peridium; the
threads very long, slender, much branched and interwoven. =Spores=
small, globose, usually sessile or with only a minute pedicel. _Morgan._

Puffballs of the largest size, growing on the ground in fields and
woods. _Morgan._


                              I.—SESSILES.

Peridium very large, without a distinct base; subgleba nearly obsolete,
the mass of spores and capillitium quite filling the interior.


=C. gigantea= Batsch.—gigantic. (_L. bovista_ Linn.; _L. maximum_
Schaeff.; _L. giganteum_ Batsch.) Very large, 10–20 in. in diameter,
obconic or depressed-globose, nearly or quite sessile, white or whitish,
becoming discolored by age, smooth or slightly roughened by weak spinose
or minute floccose warts, sometimes cracking in areas; capillitium and
spores yellowish-green to dingy-olive. =Spores= smooth, 4µ in. in
diameter. Edible. _Peck_, 32d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= globose, even or sometimes minutely warted, 3.5–4.5 in. in
diameter, often with a minute pedicel. _Morgan._

Common over the states. Growing on the ground in grassy places in fields
and woods. August to October.

As the name implies, this species is gigantic. It is the largest of all
fungi. It has attained the diameter of three feet in this country, but
is reported larger in Europe. I have found it in West Virginia weighing
nine pounds, but one is reported as found in Gordon Park weighing
forty-seven pounds. I have often followed the advice of Vittadini and
sliced a meal for my family from growing individuals. The cut surface
contracts and dries. The plant seems to be deprived of its power to
further ripen. It can thus be cut for many days. It has other than food
uses in its dry form—as a sponge, as tinder, as a color, as a styptic in
hemorrhage; the Finns make a remedy of it for diarrhea in calves, and it
is burned under bee-hives to stupefy bees.

It, as well as L. cyathiforme, is an admirable and delicate fungus.


=C. pachyder´ma= Pk. _Gr_—thick-skinned. =Peridium= very large, globose
or obovoid, often irregular, with a thick cord-like root; cortex thin,
smooth, whitish, persistent, drying up into polygonal areolæ which are
white in the center with a brown border; inner peridium very thick but
fragile, with a separable membranaceous lining, after maturity gradually
breaking up into fragments and falling away. Subgleba obsolete; mass of
spores and capillitium greenish-yellow then olive-brown; the threads
very long, occasionally septate, branched, mostly thinner than the
spores. =Spores= globose, distinctly warted, 5–6µ in diameter, sometimes
with a minute pedicel.

Growing on the ground. Arizona, _Pringle_; Dakota, _Miss Nellie Crouch_.
=Peridium= 4–8 in. in diameter. Remarkable for its thick peridium, which
becomes white spotted and areolate. _Morgan._

I have not seen this species.

  CALVATIA CYATHIFORMIS.
  (Lycoperdon Cyathiforme.)
]


                           II.—CYATHIFORMES.

Peridium large, top-shaped, with a stout thick base; subgleba limited
and concave above, persistent.


=C. cyathifor´mis= Bosc.—cup-shaped. (_L. cyathiforme_ Bosc.) (Plate
CLXII, p. 584.) =Peridium= 3–6 in. in diameter, globose or
depressed-globose, smooth or minutely floccose or scaly, whitish
cinereous brown or pinkish brown, often cracking into areas in the upper
part, commonly with a short, thick, stem-like base; capillitium and
spores purple-brown, these and the upper part of the peridium falling
away and disappearing when old, leaving a cup-shaped base with a ragged
margin. =Spores= globose, rough, purple-brown, 5–6.5µ broad. _Peck_,
48th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Common over United States. Indiana, _H.I. Miller_; West Virginia, New
Jersey. On open grassy ground. July to October. _McIlvaine._

Often a queer, ragged, cup-shaped, purplish mass is noticed protruding
from the ground, looking as if the upper half had been cut off
horizontally. This is the mature C. cyathiformis, or rather, what is
left of it. The upper half has blown away and is spreading its spores
elsewhere.

A first-class Lycoperdon, meaty and of excellent flavor. When it occurs,
it is usually in plenty. On the great parade ground at Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
it annually appears in large quantities. Cows are fond of it, and it is
this fungus which is currently believed among farmers to affect milk. I
have watched cows pawing it to pieces and eating portions of it.


=C. fra´gilis= Vitt.—fragile. =Peridium= obovoid, plicate below, with a
short-pointed base and a cord-like root. Cortex a smooth continuous
layer, very thin and fragile, separable, white or grayish, becoming
brownish and tinged with violet and purple, commonly areolate above;
inner peridium thin, violet to purple, velvety, extremely fragile, after
maturity the upper part soon breaking up into fragments and falling
away. Subgleba occupying but a small portion of the peridium, cup-shaped
above, persistent; mass of spores and capillitium from violet to pale
purple; the threads very long, mostly thinner than the spores, scarcely
branched. =Spores= globose, minutely warted, 4–5.5µ in diameter,
sessile.

Growing on the open prairies. Wisconsin, _Brown_; Iowa, _McBride_;
Nebraska, Wyoming, _Webber_; Kansas, _Cragin_; California, _Harkness_.

stout thick base and a cord-like root. Cortex a thickish floccose layer,
with coarse warts or spines above, whitish then ochraceous or finally
brown, at length breaking up into areola which are more or less
persistent; inner peridium thick but fragile, thinner about the apex,
where it finally ruptures, forming a large irregular lacerate aperture.
Subgleba occupying nearly half the peridium, cup-shaped above and a long
time persistent; mass of spores and capillitium compact, farinaceous,
greenish-yellow or olivaceous, becoming pale to dark-brown; the threads
very much branched, the primary branches two or three times as thick as
the spores, very brittle, soon breaking up into fragments. =Spores=

An excellent species.


=C. hiema´lis= Bull.—belonging to winter. =Peridium= obovoid or
top-shaped, depressed above, with a stout thick base and a cord-like
root. Cortex a thin furfuraceous coat, with stout convergent spines
above, whitish or gray, becoming yellowish and reddish, after maturity
gradually falling away from the upper part; inner peridium thin,
submembranaceous, pallid or brownish, dehiscent at the apex by an

=C. craniifor´mis= Schw.—_cranion_, a skull. =Peridium= very large,
obovoid or turbinate, depressed above, the base thick and stout, with a
cord-like root. Cortex a smooth continuous layer, very thin and fragile,
easily peeling off, pallid or grayish, sometimes with a reddish tinge,
often becoming folded in areas; the inner peridium thin, ochraceous to
bright brown, velvety, extremely fragile, after maturity the upper part
breaking up into fragments and falling away. Subgleba occupying about
one-half of the peridium, cup-shaped above and a long time persistent;

olivaceous; the threads very long, about as thick as the spores,
branched. =Spores= globose, even, 3–3.5µ in diameter, with a minute
pedicel.

Growing on the ground in woods. =Peridium= commonly 3–6 in. in diameter
and 4–5 in. in height, but much larger specimens are sometimes met with.
This species abounds in the woods of southern Ohio, growing in great
patches of numerous individuals. I do not know that the edible qualities
of this species have been tested. _Morgan._

Chester county, Pa. Springton Hills. On ground in mixed woods. August to
October. _McIlvaine._

Not a frequent species with us. I have seen it only in the locality
named. The substance is very like that of L. pyriforme. When white it
has a strong but pleasant odor, and in this condition it is an excellent
fungus. The slightest change to yellow makes it bitter.

=C. rubro-fla´va= Cragin—reddish-yellow. =Peridium= obconic, tapering
gradually downward to the rooting mycelium. Cortex a very thin
furfuraceous or granulose coat, with a few short, scattered spinules
above; inner peridium thin and fragile, at first whitish, soon becoming
orange-red to orange-brown in color, after maturity the upper part
breaking up into fragments and falling away. Subgleba occupying about a
third part of the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium reddish-ocher
then olivaceous-orange; the threads very long, rather thicker than the
spores, branched. =Spores= globose, even, 3–3.5µ in diameter, sometimes
with a minute pedicel.

Growing on the ground. Kansas, _Cragin_, _Kellerman_. =Peridium= 1½-3
in. in height with a breach of 1–2 in. The peculiar orange or rather
reddish-ocher color with which the whole plant is pervaded at maturity
is very remarkable. _Morgan._


                            III.—STIPITATÆ.

Peridium depressed, globose above, abruptly contracted below into a long
stem-like base; subgleba not definitely limited above, continuous with
the capillitium, persistent.


=C. sacca´ta= (Vahl.) Fr.—_saccus_, a bag or pouch. Medium size, 2–4 in.
high, 1–2 in. broad. =Peridium= depressed-globose or somewhat lentiform,
supported by a long stem-like base, furfuraceous with minute persistent
mealy or granular warts or spinules, often plicate beneath, white or
creamy-white, at maturity becoming brown or olive-brown, subshining and
very thin or membranous, breaking up into irregular fragments which
sometimes adhere to the capillitium for a considerable time, the
stem-like base cylindrical or narrowed downward, sometimes thick;
capillitium rather dense, subpersistent, and with the spores dingy-olive
or dingy-brown, sometimes verging toward purplish-brown. =Spores= rough,
4–5µ in diameter. Edible.

Low mossy grounds and bushy swamps, especially under alders. Sandlake,
Center and Adirondack mountains. August to October. _Peck_, 32d Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

West Virginia, 1881–1885; Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina.
Frequent, thin moist woods. July to November. _McIlvaine._

C. saccata, the long-stemmed puff-ball, is a common and pleasing
species. Shape, color, feel, combine to make it attractive. It is one of
the very best we have. When white inside and otherwise in good condition
it is delicious.

=C. ela´ta= Massee. =Peridium= globose or depressed-globose above,
plicate below and abruptly contracted into a long stem-like base; the
base slender, cylindric or tapering downward, sometimes pitted; mycelium
fibrous and filamentous. Cortex a very thin coat of minute persistent
spinules or granules; inner peridium white or cream-colored, becoming
brown or olivaceous, very thin and fragile, after maturity the upper
part soon breaking up into fragments and falling away. Subgleba
occupying the stem-like base, a long time persistent; mass of spores and
capillitium brown or brownish-olivaceous; the threads very long,
branched, the main stem as thick as the spores, the branches more
slender. =Spores= globose, even or very minutely warted, 4–5µ in
diameter with a short or minute pedicel.

Growing among mosses in low grounds and bushy places. New England,
_Humphrey_; New York, _Peck_. =Peridium= 1–2 in. in diameter and 3–6 in.
in height, the stem-like base ½-¾ of an inch in thickness. This American
form of Lycoperdon saccatum has lately been separated from it, and
named, figured and described as Lycoperdon elatum by George Massee.
_Morgan._

Edible.




                     GENUS IX.—=LYCOPER´DON= Tourn.


Mycelium fibrous, rooting from the base. =Peridium= small, globose,
obovoid or turbinate, with a more or less thickened base; cortex a
subpersistent coat of soft spines, scales, warts or granules; inner
peridium thin, membranaceous becoming papyraceous, dehiscent by a
regular apical mouth. _Morgan._

When the plant sits (without stem) directly upon the ground or wood it
is _sessile_. The outer layer of the two parts of its covering is the
_exterior peridium_ (sometimes spoken of as _cortex_). This frequently
breaks up into scales, spines, bristles, minute flocculent or powdery
masses, and these vary in size and in many species disappear as the
plant matures. These are of determining value in several species of
Lycoperdaceæ. Plants with coarse, long spines are _echinate_ because
they bristle. When the spines incline together and form a point they are
_stellate_. Various formations of this outside covering are also called
_warts_. The inner rind or skin is the true _peridium_.

The mass of thread-like filaments which fills the interior of the plant
is called the _capillitium_. The filaments are deftly interlaced. At
times filaments springing from the base do not interlace with the
others; these are called _columellæ_. These filaments bear the
spores—the dust which puffs out in such quantity and gives the common
name to the plant—puff-ball—and its Mephistophelian one—The Devil’s
Snuff-box. In some species the filaments at the base of the plant are
_sterile_—they do not bear spores. These filaments are more contracted
and form the neck, stem or _subgleba_. The _gleba_ is the upper interior
of the plant, in which the spores are contained. See plate CLVI.

_Dehiscent_ is said of an organ which opens of itself at maturity. A
plant is dehiscent at the discharging point of its spores. If this is at
the summit it is _apically dehiscent_.

The descriptions herein given of American representatives of European
species are in many instances those of A.P. Morgan, who has made special
study of this genus, and those of Professor C.H. Peck, whose interstate
experience acquaints him with every varying form. Mr. Morgan has kindly
given permission to use his text and drawings.

No one has yet had reason to doubt the harmlessness of any puff-ball.
There are a few I have not eaten, but believing that these will be
proven edible, descriptions of all species occurring in America are
given.

There are first and second-class puff-balls. Usually the small species
are slightly strong, and if a shade of yellow appears upon breaking any
puff-ball, it will be more or less bitter and will spoil a whole dish.
The larger species are milder. The flavor of puff-balls appears to be
issued to them as a ration. It is all there in a little fellow, and in a
big one it is simply spread through more substance.

Lafayette B. Mendel in Am. Jour. of Physiology, March, 1898, gives the
nitrogenous compounds in L. bovista as:

               Nitrogen soluble in gastric juice     3.13
               Digestible protein nitrogen           3.13

    (_a_) _Cortex consisting of very long convergent spines; denuded
                           peridium smooth._


=L. echina´tum= Pers.—prickly. (_L. Peck´ii_ Morg.) (Plate CLVI, fig. 2,
p. 568.) =Peridium= ¾-1½ in. broad, subglobose, generally narrowed below
into a short stem-like base, whitish brownish or pinkish-brown, echinate
above with rather stout spines, which at length fall off and leave the
surface smooth; toward the base spinulose or furfuraceous; capillitium
and spores dingy-olive. =Spores= minutely rough, 4µ in diameter.

Ground and decaying wood in woods. Albany, Forestburg and Adirondack
mountains. August to October.

The whole plant is generally obovate, pyriform or turbinate, and the
spines are larger and more or less curved at and near the apex,
diminishing in size toward the base where they are more persistent. In
the immature condition it is difficult to distinguish it from L.
pedicellatum; but when mature its smooth peridium and spores destitute
of pedicels separate it. _Peck_, 32d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

L. echinatum appears to be common to all the states. August to frost. It
is frequent but not abundant. Raw the taste is slight. Cooked it is
tender and of good flavor.


=L. pulcher´rimum= B. and C. (_L. Frost´ii_ Pk.) =Peridium= usually
obovoid, sometimes subturbinate, with a short stout base; the mycelium
forming a thick cord-like root. Cortex consisting of very long white
spines, converging and often coherent at the apex; the spines at length
fall away from the upper part of the peridium, leaving the inner
peridium with a smooth purplish-brown shining surface, sometimes faintly
reticulated. Subgleba occupying about a third part of the peridium; mass
of spores and capillitium at first olivaceous, then brownish-purple; the
threads much branched, the main stem thicker than the spores, the
branches long, slender and tapering. =Spores= globose, minutely warted,
4.5–5.5µ in diameter.

=Peridium= 1–2½ in. in diameter and 1–2 in. in height.

The fresh specimens of this plant have a strong and not unpleasant
fragrance.

Growing in low grounds, in fields and woods. September, October.

L. pulcherrimum is frequent, but not abundant. It ranks with
second-class puff-balls. It is good when young and fresh.

sometimes depressed, 10–18 lines broad, echinate with rather long stout
crowded brown spines which are either straight curved or stellately
united and which at length fall off and leave the surface reticulate
with brown lines; capillitium and spores brown or purplish-brown,
columella present. =Spores= rough, 5–6.5µ in diameter.

=L. hirtum= Mart.—hairy. =Peridium= broadly turbinate, depressed above,
contracted below into a short, thick, tapering or pointed base, with a
cord-like root. Cortex a dense coat of soft spines, long, slender and
convergent above, becoming shorter downward, gray or brownish in color;
these finally fall away, leaving the inner peridium with a brown or
purplish-brown, smooth, shining surface. Subgleba occupying from
one-third to one-half of the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium
olivaceous, then brownish-purple; the threads branched, the main stem
about as thick as the spores, with slender, tapering branches. =Spores=
globose, distinctly warted, 5–6µ in diameter.

Growing on the ground in woods. =Peridium= 1–2½ in. in diameter and 1½-2
in. in height. This species in this country heretofore has been included
with L. atropurpureum. I have followed Mr. Massee in keeping them
separate. This is perhaps L. bicolor W. and C., of the Pacific Coast
Catalogue. _Morgan._

New York, _Peck_, 46th Rep.; West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.
Ground in woods. August to October. _McIlvaine._

It is edible. Good when young and fresh.


=L. atropurpur´eum= Vitt.—_ater_, black; _purpureus_, purple—of the
spores. =Peridium= globose depressed-globose or obovate, 6–30 lines
broad, generally narrowed below into a short stem-like base, white
cinereous or brownish, mealy-spinulose, hairy-spinulose, echinate or
stellately echinate, when denuded smooth and subshining; capillitium and
spores finally purplish-brown, columella present. =Spores= rough, 5–6µ
in diameter.

Sandy pastures, woods and bushy places. Common. August to October.

This appears to be one of the most polymorphous species we have. It is
so variable that I have been obliged to modify the usual description
very much, in order to include forms which are quite diverse, yet which
appear to me to run together in such a way that I am unable to draw any
satisfactory line of distinction between them.

There are three principal varieties which I have referred to this
species. The first is usually 1–2 in. broad, sessile, or with a very
short stem, nearly smooth, being mealy or pruinose, and having a few
minute, weak, scattered spinules or scales. Its color is generally
whitish or white slightly clouded with brown. It grows in sandy pastures
and cleared lands, and is probably the nearest of the three in its
resemblance to the type.

I regard the second and third as worthy of a name and designate and
define them as follows:

Var. _hirtel´lum_. =Peridium= hairy-spinulose with erect or curved
sometimes stellately united spinules, which are often of a blackish
color.

Ground and decaying vegetable matter in woods.

Var. _stella´re_. =Peridium= echinate or stellately echinate with rather
stout easily deciduous spines.

Ground in woods and bushy places.

In this species the capillitium and spores are at first greenish-yellow,
olive-tinted or brownish; but when fully mature they are purple-tinted.
Some care will, therefore, be necessary, lest the last variety be
confused with the Echinate Puff-ball, L. echinatum. _Peck_, 32d Rep.
N.Y. State Bot.

=Spores= 6–7µ _Massee_; globose, distinctly warted, 5.5–6µ, _Morgan_.

Ohio, West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. On ground in woods.
August to October. _McIlvaine._

L. atropurpureum is frequent, not abundant. It is edible, good.


  (_c_) _Cortex composed of minute spinules; denuded peridium smooth._


=L. cu´pricum= Bon.—coppery. =Peridium= obconic, depressed above and
tapering downward, the base plicate, with a fibrous mycelium. Cortex
gray or flesh-color, composed of minute spinules circularly arranged and
convergent and coherent at the apex; these dry up, becoming dark
purplish in color, and finally fall away from the smooth, shining,
copper-colored surface of the inner peridium. Subgleba occupying nearly
a third part of the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium, at length
purplish-brown; the threads branched, the main stem thinner than the
spores, with long, tapering branches. =Spores= globose, distinctly
warted, 6–7µ in diameter.

Growing in sandy soil in woods. New Jersey, _Ellis_.

Peridium about 1 in. in diameter and an inch or more in height. The
microscopic features are given from specimens received from Mr. Ellis.
_Morgan._

Near Haddonfield, N.J., 1891–1896. Sandy woods. _McIlvaine._

Not frequent. Those found upon several occasions were eaten and found
good.


=L. asterosper´mum= D. and M.—_aster_, star; _sperma_, seed. =Peridium=
obovoid or pyriform (pear-shaped), the base short and pointed, with a
slender fibrous mycelium. Cortex a thin coat of minute spinules with
intermingled granules, gray or brownish above, paler below; these dry up
and are a long time persistent, but they finally fall away, leaving the
inner peridium with a pale brown, smooth, shining surface. Subgleba
obconical, occupying nearly a third part of the peridium; mass of spores
and capillitium olivaceous, then brownish-purple; the threads about as
thick as the spores, with slender tapering branches. =Spores= globose,
distinctly warted, 5.5–6.5µ in diameter.

=Peridium= 1–1½ in. in diameter. A very pretty species of regular form;
its glossy cortex is quite persistent. _Morgan._

Growing on the ground in open woods. Ohio, _Morgan_; Nebraska, _Webber_.

New York, _Peck_, 46th, 51st Rep.; Ohio, _Lloyd_.


=L. delica´tum= Berk. =Peridium= subglobose, plicate underneath, with a
fibrous mycelium. Cortex a thin coat of minute spinules and granules,
gray or brownish above, whitish below, finally falling away from the
smooth, shining, pale or brownish surface of the inner peridium.
Subgleba very small or quite obsolete; mass of spores and capillitium
olivaceous, then pale or brownish-purplish; the threads rather thinner
than the spores, with slender tapering branches. =Spores= globose,
distinctly warted, 5–6µ in diameter.

=Peridium= 1–2 in. in diameter. _Morgan._

Growing on the ground. Pennsylvania, _Gentry_; Missouri, _Professor

=L. glabel´lum= Pk.—smooth, bare. Subglobose or subturbinate, 1–1.5 in.
broad, sometimes narrowed below into a short stem-like base,
furfuraceous with very minute nearly uniform persistent warts, which
appear to the naked eye like minute granules or papillæ, yellow, opening
by a small aperture; inner mass purplish-brown, capillitium with a
central columella. =Spores= purplish-brown, globose, rough, 5–6.5µ in
diameter.

Ground in copses and in pine woods. West Albany and North Greenbush.
Autumn. _Peck_, 31st Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Ohio, _Morgan_; Wisconsin, _Trelease_; West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey. Frequent. Autumn. _McIlvaine._

One of the prettiest Lycoperdons. Symmetrical, and otherwise attractive.
Sweet, firm, solid. It is not high in flavor, but is delicate.


=L. elonga´tum= Berk.—elongated. =Peridium= globose above, contracted
below into a stout thick base, more or less elongated and cylindric or
tapering downward; mycelium composed of thick fibers. Cortex a loose
flocculose white or yellowish coat, drying up into a mealy or
furfuraceous persistent layer, which scarcely reveals the pale shining
surface of the inner peridium. Subgleba occupying more than half the
interior of the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium pale
olivaceous, then pale brown or finally purplish; the threads much
branched, the main stem much thicker than the spores, the branches
tapering. =Spores= globose, distinctly warted, 5.5–6.5µ in diameter.

Growing on the ground in damp woods. Ohio, _Morgan_. =Peridium= 1–2 in.
in diameter and 2–3 in. in height, the base ¾-1 in. in thickness. In
form it somewhat resembles L. gemmatum, but it has a cortex like that of
L. glabellum. _Morgan._

New York, _Peck_, 49th Rep. Closely allied to L. glabellum. Its stout
elongated base serves as a mark of distinction.

Ohio, _Morgan_; Pennsylvania, Washington, Pa., Myc. Club.

Not common. Sometimes tufted, three or four together. Edible, good.


=L. el´egans= Morgan—elegant. =Peridium= large, depressed globose,
plicate underneath and sometimes with a narrow umboniform base, which is
continuous with the thick root. Cortex at first flocculose, white or
yellowish, drying up into a dense furfuraceous persistent coat, which
becomes ochraceous or brownish in color, and sometimes obscurely
areolate. Subgleba broad, convex above, occupying a third part or more
of the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium olivaceous, then
pale-brown or finally purplish-brown; the threads much branched, the
main stem thicker than the spores, the branches long and tapering.
=Spores= globose, distinctly warted, 5–6µ, in diameter.

Growing on rich soil on the open prairie about Iowa City, Ia., _Prof.
T.H. McBride_. =Peridium= 1½-3 in. in diameter. In form and size this
species somewhat resembles Calvatia fragilis, but the threads are
arranged in two sets as in Lycoperdon; the cortex is similar to that of
L. glabellum; the mycelium forms a remarkably thick root. _Morgan._

=L. rimula´tum= Pk.—_rimula_, a small chink. =Peridium=
depressed—globose or broadly obovoid, plicate underneath with a slender
fibrous mycelium. Cortex at first a thin, smooth, continuous fibrillose
layer, gray or bluish-gray, sometimes with a purplish tinge; this at
length breaks into a network of fine lines or fissures, gradually dries
up into minute thin adnate scales, and finally falls away from the
smooth grayish or purplish-brown surface of the inner peridium. Subgleba
broad, but distinct, plane above, occupying about a fourth part of the
peridium; mass of spores and capillitium purplish-gray, then
brownish-purple; the threads simple or scarcely branched, variable in
thickness, but always thinner than the spores. =Spores= glovose,
distinctly warted, 6–7µ in diameter, often pedicellate.

Growing on the ground in fields and open woods. New York, _Peck_; South
Carolina, _Atkinson_; Ohio, _Morgan_; Wisconsin, _Trelease_. =Peridium=
¾-1½ in. in diameter, scarcely an inch in height. _Morgan._

A pretty species, generally in groups. Frequent. It is not common, but
occasionally generous patches of it are found. Edible, good.


=L. vela´tum= Vitt.—_velatus_, having a velum. =Peridium= globose or
obovoid, with a cord-like root. Cortex white or yellowish, at first a
thickish continuous layer, then breaking up into circular or irregular
persistent patches with fimbriate margins. Subgleba occupying about a
third part of the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium olivaceous,
then purplish-brown; the threads branched, the main stem nearly as thick

the base short and obconic or more elongated and tapering or
subcylindric, arising from a fibrous mycelium. Cortex consisting of
long, thick, erect spines or warts of irregular shape, with intervening
smaller ones, whitish or gray in color, sometimes with a tinge of red or
brown; the larger spines first fall away, leaving pale spots on the
surface, and giving it a reticulate appearance. Subgleba variable in
amount, usually more than half the peridium; mass of spores and
capillitium greenish-yellow, then pale-brown; threads simple or scarcely
branched, about as thick as the spores. =Spores= globose, even or very
minutely warted, 3.5–4.5µ in diameter.

Edible, but not pleasant. _Peck._ Edible, _H.I. Miller_.

Professor Peck gives two varieties:

Var. _hir´tum_. Turbinate, subsessile, hairy with soft, slender warts
which generally become blackish.

Var. _papilla´tum_. Subrotund, sessile, papillose,
furfuraceous-pulverulent.

Very common and known in all countries. It is, to my thinking, our
prettiest puff-ball. Its beautifully studded surface, reminding of
exquisite settings, is in itself worth studying for the designs. It is
usually solitary or in small groups, but at times these groups contain
scores of individuals. It grows in the open on the ground or from both
ground and wood, in woods.

I think it equal to any other puff-ball. But great care must be taken to
examine each specimen before putting it into the pan. A single one,
which has turned yellow in the slightest degree, will spoil a whole
dish. And this is the case with any of the small puff-balls. One ageing
L. pyriforme will embitter a hundred.


=L. perla´tum= Pers.—_perfero_, to endure. (Enduring through winter.)
=Peridium= turbinate, broad and depressed above, plicate underneath and
contracted into a short and pointed or sometimes elongated and tapering
base; mycelium fibrous. Cortex of long slender spines, mingled with
smaller spinules and warts, gray brown or blackish in color; the longer
spines first fall away, leaving a reticulate surface to the inner
peridium. Subgleba occupying one-third to one-half of the peridium; mass
of spores and capillitium greenish-yellow, then brownish-olivaceous; the
threads mostly simple, some of them thicker than the spores. =Spores=
globose, even or very minutely warted, 3.5–4.5µ in diameter.

Growing on the ground in woods. =Peridium= 1–2 in. in diameter and 1–2
in. in height. This is _L. gemmatum_, var. _hirtum_, of Peck’s United

=L. excipulifor´me= Scop.—_excipula_, a receptacle. =Peridium=
turbinate, depressed above, plicate below and contracted into a more or
less elongated base. Cortex of large stout spines, convergent above,
becoming smaller downward, which at length fall away, leaving a
tomentose surface to the inner peridium. Subgleba occupying one-half or
more of the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium greenish-yellow,
then brownish-olivaceous; the threads about as thick as the spores,
scarcely branched. =Spores= globose, minutely warted, 4–5µ in diameter.

into a stem-like base, whitish or cinereous, becoming dingy or
smoky-brown with age, echinate with rather dense spines which are either
straight, curved or stellately united and which at length fall off and
leave impressions or obscure reticulations on the surface; capillitium
and spores greenish-yellow, then dingy-olive, columella present.
=Spores= smooth, pedicellate, 4–4.5µ in diameter, the pedicel three to
five times as long.

Ground and decaying wood in woods and bushy places. Croghan, Center,
Brewerton and Catskill mountains. Autumn. Oneida. _Warne._

The pedicellate spores constitute the peculiar feature of this species.
It is one which suggests the name and which enables the species to be
easily distinguished from all its allies. The spore is terminally and
persistently attached to the pedicel, as in some species of Bovista. The
plant is sometimes sessile, but usually it is narrowed below into a
stem-like base. In the immature state it has a rough, shaggy appearance,
but the spines shrivel with age so that it appears less rough when old.
The pitted surface of the denuded peridium affords a mark of distinction
from L. echinatum. L. pulcherrimum B. and C. is evidently the same
species, but the name here adopted has priority of publication. _Peck_,

with a very short rooting base and a slender fibrous mycelium. Cortex
consisting of a pale yellowish farinaceous layer, covered by a coat of
soft, fragile white spines, curved and convergent at the apex; after
maturity it soon disappears, leaving a pale smooth surface to the inner
peridium. Subgleba small, but distinct, convex above and definitely
limited; mass of spores and capillitium greenish-yellow, then pale
olivaceous; the threads long, simple, hyaline, two to three times as
thick as the spores. =Spores= globose, even, 3.5–4µ in diameter.

=Peridium= ⅜-¾ of an inch in diameter. This is _L. Wrightii_, var.
_typicum_, of Peck’s U.S. species of Lycoperdon. The peculiar
characteristic of the species is the hyaline threads of the capillitium;
although they are of large diameter, yet the walls are very thin and the
threads collapse in drying. _Morgan._

General. Growing gregariously and sometimes cespitosely on the ground,
in meadows, pastures and even in cultivated fields.

I have met with this very small and rare species but once, and then but
two specimens were found. In these the apex was compressed or laterally
flattened, instead of papilliform, as required by the original
description of the species; but in all other respects they agree well
with the specific characters. The plant is very distinct from all our
other species by its small size and ovate or conical shape. _Peck_, 32d

=L. Wright´ii= B. and C.—in honor of Charles Wright. =Peridium= globose,
depressed-globose or lentiform, 6–24 lines in diameter, generally
sessile, white or whitish, echinate with deciduous sometimes crowded
stellate spines or pyramidal warts, when denuded smooth or minutely
velvety; capillitium and spores dingy-olive, columella present. =Spores=
smooth, 4µ in diameter. Edible.

Ground in pastures and grassy places. Very common. July to October.

This is another very variable species. The typical form is a small one,
minutely echinate and having the denuded peridium smooth. The plant
often occurs much larger and more coarsely echinate with stout angular
spines or pyramidal warts, which fall off and generally leave the
surface of the peridium velvety.

Var. _typ´icum_. Small, 6–9 lines broad, globose, minutely echinate, the
warts quickly falling off and leaving the peridium smooth. (L. Wrightii
B. and C.)

Var. _sep´arans_. Larger, 10–24 lines broad, subglobose or lentiform,
echinate with coarse substellate spines or pyramidal warts, which at
length fall off and leave the peridium smooth or velvety. (L. separans
Pk.)

Var. _atropunc´tum_. Larger, 10–15 lines broad, subglobose, pure white,
warts or coarse spines brown or blackish at the tips.

This species is generally gregarious, but sometimes it forms tufts of
several individuals closely crowded together. It sometimes occurs in
cultivated grounds and stubble fields. The under surface is occasionally
plicate as in the long-stemmed puff-ball. In the var. separans the warts
or spines are crowded at their thickened bases and slightly attached to
each other, so that they come off at maturity in flakes or patches. When
the denuded surface of the peridium is velvety, it is usually of a
darker color than when smooth, being subcinnamon, reddish-brown or
dark-brown. _Peck_, 32d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

Ground in grassy places. July to frost. _McIlvaine._

                      GENUS XI.—=CATAS´TOMA= Morg.


Puff-balls growing just beneath the surface of the ground and connected
immediately with it by filamentous threads, which issue from every part
of the cortex; after maturity, when the peridium breaks away, the lower
part of the outer coat is held fast by the soil, while the upper portion
which has attained the surface remains, covering the inner peridium like
a cap or inverted cup; consequently the apparent apex at which the mouth
is situated is the actual base of the plant as it grows. The capillitium
threads are similar to the densely interwoven hyphæ, which form the
inner peridium and are evidently branches of them radiating from the
interior. It is plain that the affinities of these plants are closest
with Tylostoma and Astræus, but the needs of a systematic arrangement,
according to more obvious characters, causes us to place them next to
Bovista. _Morgan._

I have not seen this acrobatic species. Study of its unique habit
suggests the query: Is not the turning over of its spore-filled portion
a substitute for an original but lost power of growing right side up?

=B. nigres´cens= (Vitt.) Pers.—blackish. Peridium subglobose, with a
fibrous mycelium. Cortex a thin, smooth, white continuous layer, at
maturity breaking up into scales, which soon disappear; inner peridium
thin, flaccid, becoming dark-brown, smooth and shining, dehiscent at the
apex by a lacerate mouth. Mass of spores and capillitium soft, lax, at
first ochraceous or olivaceous, at length purplish-brown; the threads
flexuous, about 1 mm. in extent, three to five times branched, the main

Peridium 1–2 in. in diameter. I have never succeeded in obtaining an
American specimen of this species; my description is drawn up from
European specimens. _Morgan._

=B. plum´bea= Pers.—lead-colored. Peridium ¾-1¼ in. in diameter,
depressed-globose, with a fibrous mycelium. Cortex a thin, smooth, white
continuous coat, loosening at maturity and shelling off, except
sometimes a small portion about the base; inner peridium thin, tough,
smooth, lead-colored, dehiscent at the apex by a round or oblong
aperture. Mass of spores and capillitium soft, lax, ochraceous or
olivaceous, then purplish-brown, the threads .8–1.0 mm. in extent, three
to five times branched, the main stem 12–16µ thick, the ultimate

groups. Spring to autumn; after rains, _McIlvaine_.

Edible. _Trelease_, _Badham_.

The botanic difference between a Lycoperdon and a Bovista does not
affect the Mycophagist. He can not distinguish the difference when
cooked. B. plumbea is given in Cooke and in Massee as Lycoperdon
plumbeum. Bovista plumbea is a first-class edible.

except sometimes a small portion about the base; inner peridium thin,
smooth, flaccid, reddish-brown, dehiscent by a regular apical mouth.
Mass of spores and capillitium olivaceous, then reddish-brown; the
threads curled and flexuous, with an expanse of 1.0–1.5 mm., two to four
times branched, the main stem 10–15µ thick, the ultimate branches very

Mycelium funicular, rooting from the base. =Peridium= subglobose,
without a thickened base; cortex a smooth continuous layer, at first
closely adnate to the inner peridium, after maturity gradually breaking
up and falling away; inner peridium thick, tough, coriaceous, becoming

Puff-balls of considerable size, growing in the sandy soil of dry
regions. A very distinct genus, in no way related to Scleroderma, and
resembling it only in its thick, corky, inner peridium. The threads of
the capillitium originate within the tissue of the gleba, along with the
spores, and are set free by deliquescence, the same as in Bovista.
_Morgan._


=M. spinulo´sum= Pk. =Peridium= globose, depressed globose, sometimes
elongated and often irregular, with a thick, cord-like root. Cortex at
first a thickish, white, smooth, continuous layer; after maturity it
cracks or becomes furrowed into large polygonal areas, and at length
falls away in large flakes or scales; inner peridium very thick, at
first white and coriaceous, becoming hard, dry, brown and rigid, the
upper part finally breaking up into irregular lobes or fragments. Mass
of spores and capillitium compact then friable, at first olivaceous,
then dark purplish-brown; the threads bent, curved and flexuous,
subhyaline, .2-.7 mm. in length, about the same thickness as the spores,
with a few short branches, and with scattered prickles, which are most
abundant toward the acute extremities. =Spores= globose, very minutely
warted, opaque, 9–12µ in. diameter, often with a minute or slender
hyaline pedicel.

Skin firm with an innate bark, bursting irregularly; woolly threads
adhering on all sides to the bark and forming distinct veins in the
central mass. Base sterile, usually becoming elongated into a stem-like
structure. =Spores= large, granulated.

Scleroderma vulgare and verrucosum are general and very common over the
United States. S. bovista and S. geaster have the same range but are not
so common. They much resemble puff-balls, but are more pudgy,
solid-looking. All are edible. Their qualities are noted under their
descriptions.


(Plate CLXXX.)

[Illustration: SCLERODERMA VULGARE.]

A-B. Firm when young and remain nearly so when mature.

=S. vulga´re= Fr.—_vulgaris_, common. (Plate CLXXX.) Subsessile,
irregular; bark corky, hard, opening indefinitely; inner mass in which
the spores are collected into little heaps separated by a few grayish
woolly threads, bluish-black. =Spores= dingy; in the mass blackish with
purple tinge, globose, warted, 9–11µ _Massee_.

The larger form is generally of a yellowish or brownish hue, surface
warty or covered with rough scales; the smaller, stemless minutely
warty, bright brown.

Under trees, etc. Often cespitose, 1–3 in. across. =Peridium= variable,
white or pale-brown, often becoming pink when cut. Dehiscing by decay of
upper portion of peridium. _Massee._

Scleroderma vulgare is one of our most common and plentiful toadstools.
Its hard, rough, warty, light brown knobs, single or clustered, growing
along brook-banks or under trees, generally choosing hard ground, are
known to all who observe Nature’s curiosities. When quite young they are
white inside. As they enlarge the center darkens and this purplish color
finally develops into a grayish-purplish-black which extends throughout
the interior and gives it a granular appearance. The fungus is solid,
cutting like a potato. Its smell is strong; also its taste when raw.
Sliced and well-cooked the species is good, even after it has become
purplish, but if a single one is wilted it will embitter a whole dish.
Or if it is not very well stewed or fried it remains strong. In no
condition is it injurious. Specimens must be pared, and the base well
cut away.


=S. bovis´ta= Fr. Subsessile, often irregular, peridium thin, pliant,
almost smooth; tramal walls floccose, _yellow_, mass of spores
olive-brown, spores globose, warted, 10–13µ.

Sandy soil under trees, etc. From 1–2 in. across. Distinguished by the
thin, almost smooth peridium, and the yellow tramal walls. _Massee._

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. On ground under trees. June to
November. _McIlvaine._

Not rough like S. vulgare and S. verrucosum, nor as solid. Same habit,
same edible qualities when young. It is not good after it begins to
change color.


=S. verruco´sum= Pers.—_verrucosus_, covered with warts (_verruc[oe]_).
Peridium thin above, ochraceous or dingy brown, covered with minute
warts, subglobose, continued downward as a more or less elongated
stem-like base. =Spores= umber in the mass; trama whitish.

S. vulgare, but is distinguished by the thin peridium and absence of
purple tinge in the immature spore mass. _Massee._

West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. June to October. On ground
under trees. Same habit as S. vulgare. _McIlvaine._

S. verrucosum closely resembles S. vulgare. The distinctions are noted
in the description. It must be young, fresh and white inside, or it is
bitter. It is not of as good quality as S. vulgare.


=S. geas´ter= Fr.—resembling genus Geaster in its manner of opening.
Subglobose, sessile, peridium thick, rigid, almost smooth, splitting in
an irregularly stellate manner at the apex.

Sandy places. Known by the peridium dehiscing in a stellate manner; from
1–2 in. across. _Massee._

Peridium irregularly globose, thick, attenuated downward into a
stem-like base, opening by disintegration of its upper portion; internal
mass (gleba) divided into distinct sack-like cells.

Allied to Scleroderma and distinguished by the cavities of the gleba
containing distinct peridiola. _Massee._


=P. pisocar´pium= Fr. _Gr_—a pea; _Gr_—fruited. =Peridium= irregularly
globose, indistinctly nodulose, passing downward into a stout stem-like
base; peridiola irregularly angular, 4–5×2–3µ, yellow. =Spores= globose,
warted, coffee-color, 9–13µ _Massee_.

P. pisocarpium was quite common at Mt. Gretna, Pa., from August to
October, 1898, in open pine and mixed woods, growing from sandy ground.
The height reached 5 in. and diameter 2 in. The shapes were usually
those of inverted pears, more or less flattened along their lengths.
Skin hard, polished, olivaceous-black with dull yellow mottlings, not
unlike rattlesnake skin. When broken the peridiola (small ovate
cylinders which bear the spores within) are very distinct, often over ⅛
in. long. The entire interior is dark when mature, and the rupture of
the plant is irregular and by disintegration of the upper part. They
often dry without rupturing. Search as I would, I could not find a young
one, or one in edible condition. The plant is here given because
interesting and one the student will wish to identify. It is so odd that
it is not surprising to find it employed as a medicine in China.

                 TOADSTOOL POISONING AND ITS TREATMENT

                          BY W.S. CARTER, M.D.
  Professor of Physiology and Hygiene, University of Texas, Galveston,
                                 Texas.


The poisonous mushrooms, or so-called toadstools, may be grouped in two
classes: (1) Those containing minor or irritant poisons, which act
locally on the gastro-intestinal tract, such as the Clitocybe illudens,
Lepiota Morgani and others, and (2) those containing major poisons which
act on the nerve centers after absorption, causing symptoms to appear a
long time after the poison has been taken and very often terminating
fatally. This group includes the Amanita muscaria, the Amanita bulbosa
or Am. verna and the Amanita phalloides.

From the prompt way in which vomiting and purging begin after eating the
toadstools of the first group there seems to be no doubt of the local
irritant action on the alimentary canal. Grave symptoms from any
constitutional effect or any serious disturbances of the circulation do
not occur. Although intensely disagreeable, such poisoning terminates in
recovery and may not be regarded as dangerous unless the poison be taken
in enormous quantity or by one in poor health.

In poisoning by the deadly toxic Amanitæ vomiting and purging may also
occur as prominent symptoms, but generally only occur late—ten to
fifteen hours after eating the toadstool—and are due to the action of
the poison on the nerve centers. This is clear from the fact that these
symptoms appear when the poison is given either hypodermatically or
intravenously to animals.

It is exceedingly unfortunate that these deadly poisonous toadstools do
not give some warning either in an unpleasant taste or contain an
irritant which would act locally to cause emesis and purgation, for in
that case the patient would get rid of the poison before such large
quantities were absorbed and fatal poisoning would be less frequent.
They are not at all unpalatable and sometimes large quantities are eaten
by mistake.

Formerly frequent allusion was made to the possibility of poisoning by
decomposition products from putrefactive changes in mushrooms. Not a
single case has come to the writer’s notice where this form of poisoning
has _actually_ occurred. In many reported cases of poisoning it is
distinctly stated they were eaten soon after gathering; in none does the
reporter mention any suspicion of poisoning of this nature.

At one time very many mushrooms were supposed to be poisonous. We now
know that there are only a few dangerous ones, and where serious
poisoning occurs it seems clearly to be due to some definite and
constant poisons contained in certain fungi. We shall not deal here with
the irritant poisons, as they are not dangerous and usually Nature gets
rid of them easily, but shall consider the poisons of the Amanita
muscaria or “Fly mushroom,” the A. bulbosus vernus Bull. or A. verna,
and the A. phalloides or “death cup.” The writer has not had any
personal experience with poisoning by these in man, but bases his
observations upon over one hundred experiments made upon lower
animals.[C] This is a distinct advantage in reaching any conclusion, as
the facts are definite without any doubt as to the _kind_ or _quantity_
of the poison taken. In many of the reports of poisoning by mushrooms in
man no mention of the species is made. In all these cases many kinds
have been mixed together in preparing them for the table and it has
never been known how many of the poisonous and how many of the edible
ones have been eaten by any one individual partaking of the dish. Of
course the fluid in which they are cooked contains some of the poison.
This explains why some patients recover after having eaten several
mushrooms while others die from a part of one only. (See report of six
cases by Dr. G.E. Caglieri, New York Med. Record, August 28, 1897; also
Dr. Berry’s cases reported by Prentiss, Philadelphia Med. Journal,
September 24, 1898.) Then, too, different poisonous species may be mixed
together. The symptoms produced by the different Amanitæ poisons are
quite different. Those containing irritant poisons may be taken with
those containing deadly poisons. This accounts for the great variety of
symptoms presented in cases reported.

Footnote C:

  All of the toadstools used have been very kindly furnished and
  identified by Capt. Chas. McIlvaine. Unfortunately only fifteen
  experiments could be made with the fresh fungi while the writer was at
  the University of Pennsylvania. Since leaving there it has been
  impossible to get any in a fresh state, and the other experiments have
  been made either with dried fungi or alcoholic or glycerine extracts
  of the fresh.

                     POISONING BY AMANITA MUSCARIA.

The symptoms of poisoning by this fungus usually appear from eight to
twelve hours after it has been eaten, unless it has been taken in
enormous quantities, as in the cases reported by Prentiss (Phila. Med.
Jour., September 24, 1898), where they came on in half an hour.

These begin with cramp-like pains in the extremities, colicky pains in
the abdomen, burning thirst, vomiting and purging. The pulse may be very
slow and strong at first, but later becomes rapid, small and feeble. The
blood pressure is low and, as a result of this disturbance of the
circulation, faintness is a common early symptom. Extreme pallor is
often noticed. The secretions are increased, and the sweat and the
saliva may be secreted in abnormal quantities.

The pupils are strongly contracted and dullness of the vision or double
vision may be noticed early.

The respirations are slow and become shallow and stertorous when the
poisoning is severe.

The mental state may be clear at first, but becomes dull, deepening into
unconsciousness and deep coma if a large quantity has been taken.

Convulsions are reported to have occurred in some cases from poisoning
by this toadstool in man. The dried Amanita muscaria or extracts of the
fresh fail to produce convulsions in the lower animals, even in frogs,
which are very susceptible. Either there is a considerable difference in
the susceptibility to this poison or there is some poison present in the
fresh fungus which is lost by drying.

Small amounts of the dried Amanita muscaria are said to be used by
inhabitants of northern Asia for the stimulating effect upon the nervous
system, producing, like other narcotic poisons, a dreamy state of
intoxication, deepening into sleep (Von Boeck in Ziemssen’s Cyclopedia
of Medicine, Vol. VII).

In animals the most striking effect is upon the circulation. When
injected intravenously it causes tremendous inhibition of the heart’s
action—a moderate amount causing the heart to beat slowly and
powerfully; a large amount causing complete arrest. Even with the
partial inhibition there is an enormous fall of pressure. The slowing of
the heart soon passes off, and when a moderate amount has been injected,
the circulation quickly returns to normal.

In one of my experiments on a dog, the heart stopped for 1¾ minutes and
then began beating again, the circulation soon recovering.

Late in the poisoning the heart beats may be rapid and feeble and the
blood pressure low. The lowered blood pressure is largely due to
dilatation of the small blood vessels resulting from a loss of control
over them by the nerve center which normally keeps the arterioles in a
state of partial contraction.

The inhibition of the heart is due to the action of the well-known
alkaloid _muscarine_ upon nerve ganglia in the heart. The contraction of
the pupil and the increased secretory activity of the glands are also
due to this substance which was discovered by Schmideberg and Koppe in
1869.

It was soon found that although dogs recovered from the _immediate_ or
_early effects_ (_i. e._, from the muscarine) of enormous quantities of
toadstools, they succumbed from the _late effects of much smaller
quantities_. Atropine fails to avert this result from the late effect,
whether given before the poison, with it, or after it. The inhibition of
the heart passes off long before death occurs. Late death does not
appear to be due to muscarine.

All these facts put together point to the existence of some other poison
or poisons in the Amanita muscaria to which atropine is _not_ an
antidote.

This peculiar poisoning causing death so late will be discussed again
after considering the other poisonous mushrooms as they act similarly.

Gastro-intestinal symptoms were not as common in my experiments with
Amanita muscaria as with the Amanita phalloides. Vomiting and purging
occasionally occurred early, but much more frequently late in the
poisoning and often not at all.

Convulsions did not occur in any of the animals poisoned by this fungus.
Convulsions are recorded in some cases of poisoning in man, but not so
constantly as with the A. phalloides and A. verna. Where they occurred
either a large amount had been taken (as in Prentiss' case) or there is
some doubt about the Amanita muscaria having been the only toadstool
eaten (as in Caglieri’s cases). Frogs are very easily thrown into
spasms, but no spasms were observed, even in fatal poisoning of them by
this toadstool.

Regarding cerebral symptoms, little can be said except that
unconsciousness and coma may come on early and persist till death. In
cases terminating fatally the animal seemed to be conscious, but so
depressed that it was unable to stand or even move when called.

Concerning differences in the susceptibility of different animals to the
poisons of Amanita muscaria, cats seemed to be more susceptible than
dogs in the earlier experiments with extracts of the fresh fungus, but
more numerous experiments with the dried fungus failed to show any
greater difference than can be observed between different animals of the
same kind.

As to the nature of the poisons very little can be stated from the
experiments, as they were undertaken as a preliminary step to chemical
studies to be carried on later. The alkaloid muscarine is one of our
best known poisons and nothing can be added to what is already known
about it. The poisons are extracted by distilled water as well as by a
solution of sodium chloride; they are soluble in glycerine and in
alcohol and very little difference can be seen in the action of these
extracts, unless the alcoholic extract contains more of the muscarine,
while the glycerine extract contains more of the other poisons.

It is stated that muscarine is not poisonous to flies; that the Amanita
muscaria contains a volatile poison which is poisonous to flies (hence
the name “Fly mushroom”), and which is lost by drying; that inhabitants
of northern Asia use the _dried_ fungus (after the volatile poison has
been lost) for producing intoxication (Von Boeck in Ziemssen’s
Cyclopedia, Vol. VII, p. 927). My experiments have been entirely with
mammals and frogs, and unfortunately those performed with the fresh
toadstools were not numerous enough to enable me to draw positive
conclusions as to any loss of toxicity by drying. A single experiment
with a cat seemed to indicate that boiling of the fungus lessened the
toxicity but subsequent experiments indicated that a boiled solution was
no less toxic than one not boiled.

One thing we can state definitely; that boiling the dried A. muscaria
does not destroy its toxicity. This indicates that the poison is not of
an albuminous nature, which would be coagulated by heat.

Whether or not any volatile poison is lost by boiling a solution of the
fresh fungus or by drying at 40° C. can not be stated definitely as the
experiments made with the fresh fungus were few in number on account of
the extreme difficulty in getting them perfectly fresh.

The average of six observations in which it was possible to weigh the
toadstools before and after drying at 40° C. showed a loss of 84.4 per
cent. of water. In other words, 1 gram of the dried equals 6.4 grams of
the fresh.

Comparing the lethal doses of the _dried_ with the lethal doses of the
_fresh_ extracted by glycerine and alcohol, it does not appear that
there is any great loss of the toxicity by drying as is shown by the
following: Lethal dose of dried in Experiment 31 was .085 gram. per kilo
of body weight; in Experiment 55, .033 gram. per kilo caused _early_
death, while .223 gram. of dried per kilo and .120 gram. per kilo caused
death from _late_ effects (Exps. 32 and 57). The lethal doses of the
_fresh_ were .91 gram. per kilo (Exp. 29) and 1.055 gram. per kilo (Exp.
36) when a glycerine extract of the fresh growth was used, while 1.222
gram. per kilo (Exp. 16) made from an alcoholic extract failed to kill.

It may be well to introduce here the results of an experiment which
shows there is no highly poisonous volatile material given off from the
A. phalloides. This is rather an important fact to determine, as the
opinion is held by some that there is a volatile poison, and most of my
experiments were made with the dried fungus. A 1 per cent. solution of
fresh A. phalloides was distilled until three-fourths of the fluid had
passed over as distillate. The latter was injected into the vein of a
dog and found not at all toxic. The opportunity has not been afforded me
of repeating this experiment personally, but Dr. J.P. Arnold has kindly
repeated it for me, injecting the distillate into rabbits and frogs and
failed to find it toxic. Certainly if there is any volatile poison in
the A. phalloides it must be either in very minute quantity or very
slightly toxic.

                      ANTIDOTAL VALUE OF ATROPINE.

In arriving at any conclusion we must bear in mind the variation of
different animals in their susceptibility to poisons. Thus, to give the
greatest difference observed, .085 gram. dried Amanita muscaria per kilo
of body weight killed one dog in an hour, while in another dog .223
grams. of the same preparation per kilo only killed after 24 hours, the
cardiac inhibition having disappeared one-half hour after the poison was
injected. However, an average of six (6) experiments on cats and dogs
with dried A. muscaria in which no antidote was given shows the lethal
dose to be .103 gram. per kilo of body weight. The average of four (4)
experiments, in which the fungus, dried in the same way, was used but
_atropine was given as an antidote_, gives the lethal dose of .335 gram.
per kilo and death only occurred _late_ in each case. There can be no
doubt, therefore, of the antidotal value of atropine for poisoning by
Amanita muscaria.

It should be borne in mind, however, that it is not an infallible
antidote even when given early, and that it does not prevent death from
the _late effects_ in severe cases, although given in large doses. In
some experiments atropine was administered at the same time the poison
was given and in others before it.

The important practical lesson is that too much reliance should not be
placed upon atropine. It will be shown later that it has little value as
an antidote to A. verna and A. phalloides. Probably these fungi contain
less muscarine than A. muscaria. Although there is no drug so
antagonistic in its physiological action to the poison of the A.
muscaria as atropine, the use of other remedies should not be neglected.
The symptoms have to be treated as they arise. Strychnia, alcohol in
moderate amounts and suprarenal extract could all be used to advantage
in restoring the circulation, especially late in the poisoning. Atropine
merely removes the inhibition of the heart which occurs as an early
symptom.

External heat should be applied if the body temperature is subnormal.
The treatment of gastro-intestinal symptoms will depend upon the
conditions of each individual case. The injection of a large amount of
warm physiological salt solution (.6-.7 per cent. sodium chloride) into
the subcutaneous tissues should also be tried in severe cases seen late
in the poisoning.

         POISONING BY AMANITA VERNA OR A. BULBOSUS VERNA BULL.

The symptoms appear from six to fifteen hours after the ingestion of the
poison and may be largely choleraic in nature, _i. e._, vomiting and
purging, the discharges from the bowel being watery with small flakes
suspended and sometimes containing blood.

The disturbance of the circulation is somewhat similar to that caused by
A. muscaria, viz., slow, strong pulse early, but rapid and weak later.
Dizziness and faintness may be early symptoms. Sometimes the skin is
pale and covered with cold, clammy sweat; at others there is great
cyanosis. The body temperature is subnormal, unless nervous symptoms are
very severe. Very prominent among the symptoms are tetanic convulsions,
which may appear comparatively early and persist until the end.

In animals the effect of this toadstool is entirely different from that
of A. muscaria. Perhaps the most striking difference is the frequency
with which convulsions appear. Convulsions occurred repeatedly in
mammals and in nearly every frog to which the toadstool was given. This
fungus seems to contain some poison that acts upon the spinal cord very
much as strychnia does, though less powerfully, of course.

The circulatory conditions are also different. The inhibition of the
heart may be pronounced as an early condition, but the pressure does not
return to the normal after this disappears, either from giving atropine
or from cutting the pneumogastric nerves. Section of these nerves
removes the cardiac inhibition much more completely than after poisoning
by the A. muscaria. There is often a fall of pressure without cardiac
inhibition. In other words, there is a much greater permanent fall of
blood-pressure due to paralysis of the nerve center controlling the
blood vessels (vaso-motor center). This condition will last a long time
and does not show the same tendency to disappear as after A. muscaria.
Moreover it is produced by comparatively small amounts of the A. verna.

The respirations are very slow. The blood is poorly oxygenated and this
probably causes the cyanosis sometimes observed in men poisoned by this
fungus.

Bloody fluid is sometimes vomited or comes from the nose. It may also
occur in the discharge from the bowel.

Retching and purging occurred more frequently as early symptoms than in
animals poisoned by A. muscaria.

Coma appeared early and continued until death. The administration of
atropine soon after giving the poison when cardiac inhibition was
present, caused a slight temporary rise of blood pressure but did not
affect the dilated condition of the blood vessels. The pressure
continued low notwithstanding the atropine. Although the experiments
with this fungus were not as numerous as with the A. muscaria because of
difficulty in obtaining it, yet it seems clear that atropine is of very
little value as an antidote. Death very rarely resulted from the cardiac
inhibition occurring early but usually came on late after that condition
had disappeared. The lethal dose was no larger when atropine was given
than when no antidote was used.

Amanita verna is very much more toxic than A. muscaria, the average of
four experiments in which the former was given without an antidote being
.034 gram. (dried) per kilo of body weight, while .103 gram. (dried) per
kilo, was the average for the latter fungus.

                    POISONING BY AMANITA PHALLOIDES.

The symptoms described in man are very similar to those caused by the A.
verna, except that the convulsions are less constant and cyanosis is not
mentioned. In some cases vomiting and purging are prominent symptoms.
There is dizziness and fainting, extreme ashy pallor, cold skin covered
with sweat, subnormal temperature, muscular twitchings and occasional
convulsions and somnolence which deepens into coma and lasts until
death, which usually occurs two or three days after eating the poison.
Sometimes the gastro-intestinal symptoms are less severe or may be
absent, though they are usually present; in that case the nervous
symptoms are more prominent, particularly the convulsions and
circulatory disturbance.

In experiments upon animals the convulsions were not observed so
constantly as with the A. verna. Out of twenty-five dogs poisoned by the
Amanita phalloides, convulsions only occurred twice, while twelve frogs
injected with different preparations (dried toadstool and glycerine and
alcoholic extracts of the fresh) failed to show a convulsive seizure in
a single instance. It seems to be difficult for mycologists to draw a
sharp line between the A. verna and the A. phalloides and say to which
of these two certain fungi belong. This may explain why convulsions are
recorded more frequently in persons poisoned by this toadstool than in
animals poisoned by it. Frogs are very susceptible to poisons acting
upon the spinal cord, and all of those poisoned by lethal doses of A.
verna had convulsions, while none of those poisoned by the A. phalloides
had any. It would therefore appear from this striking difference in the
physiological actions that the two are separate and distinct.

The circulatory and gastro-intestinal symptoms were quite similar to
those caused by the A. verna.

A. phalloides is less toxic than the A. verna, but more so than the A.
muscaria, the average lethal dose of the dried fungus (eight
experiments) for dogs, where no antidote was used, being .117 gram. per
kilo.

The antidotal value of atropine is very slight, if indeed it has any
action other than removing the temporary cardiac inhibition. The animals
very seldom died from this, but mostly from the late effects after the
inhibition had disappeared. In four experiments on dogs in which
atropine was given either at the same time as the poison or before it,
the average lethal dose was .198 gram. of the dried fungus per kilo. Two
dogs were killed by .1 gram. per kilo without atropine; another was
given the same amount and was given atropine hypodermatically a number
of times and recovered, though very ill for two days.

Transfusion of physiological salt solution (.6 per cent. table salt) was
practiced in three dogs. Although death occurred in all of these and the
lethal dose was not unusually high, the pressure was restored for a time
at least. It should be employed in treating poisoning in man, and not be
depended upon as the _only_ procedure, but used in conjunction with
other remedies. This will be referred to again in describing treatment.

It will be seen from the above that poisoning by the A. verna and A.
phalloides present symptoms in the lower animals which are quite
different from those caused by the A. muscaria, and that in either case
poisoning is far more serious than by the latter fungus. This is not
only because they are so much more toxic, but also because there is no
decidedly antagonistic action by atropine, and hence its value as an
antidote is much less.

In treating a case of poisoning by either A. verna or A. phalloides the
only thing that can be done is to meet the indications in the individual
case. If the heart is beating slowly, atropine should be given in
liberal doses. This will not overcome the chief disturbance of the
circulation, viz., the tremendous dilation of the blood vessels.
Strychnia will do this to a certain extent, but its use may be
contra-indicated by twitchings or convulsions from the toadstools. If it
can be used it is exceedingly valuable, as it stimulates not only the
vaso-motor center but the respiration and heart as well. Caffein or
strong coffee may also be used to this end if the stomach will retain
it. Suprarenal extract should also be given hypodermatically, as it will
restore the blood pressure more nearly to normal than any other drug,
according to our experiments. It has the advantage of not increasing the
excitability of the spinal cord as strychnia does, and hence would not
be contra-indicated by nervous symptoms.

Perhaps the most rational treatment to meet the most serious condition
of the poisoning by these toadstools is the transfusion of normal saline
solution (.6-.7 per cent. solution of table salt) into the subcutaneous
tissues. This should, of course, only be given by a physician, as great
care is required in sterilizing the syringe. It can be given with a
fountain syringe and aspirating needle beneath the skin of the thigh.
Large quantities should be used—at least a quart (1000 cc.) or more. The
fluid is rapidly absorbed by the lymphatics and gets into the blood
vessels. It restores the blood pressure by increasing the fluid in the
vessels and also doubtless aids the organs of excretion in eliminating
the poison; at the same time it would relieve the intense thirst
patients complain of. Clinicians who have observed cases of poisoning by
the A. phalloides in man have suggested this procedure as the most
rational one to meet the symptoms presented. From the condition produced
in animals poisoned by this toadstool the writer was led to the same
conclusion. In two experiments upon dogs, when transfusion of warm
physiological salt solution was made directly into the vein after
poisoning by the A. phalloides, death occurred in both cases and the
lethal dose was not unusually large, although the amount transferred was
equal to the estimated volume of the blood of the animal in one case and
half that amount in another. In another animal atropine was given before
the poison and the pressure had been reduced by the latter to one-fifth
of the normal, the transfusion of an amount of normal salt solution
equivalent to two-thirds of the bulk of blood restored the pressure to
three-fourths of normal in about 15 minutes, but further injection of
the poison caused late death.

Although the rise of pressure is not so great from transfusion as from
suprarenal extract in large doses, it is more _permanent_. Transfusion
(or transfusion into the subcutaneous tissues by hypodermoclysis which
amounts to the same thing) has the additional advantage of increasing
the flow of urine, which is often suppressed in these cases. Even if it
does no good it can do no harm if done antiseptically and should be
tried but _always in conjunction with other remedies_.

A remarkable case of recovery after the injection of a large amount of
normal saline solution has been reported by Delobel (Presse medicale
September 30, 1899). A man aged fifty-two ate some A. phalloides; he was
seen four hours afterward. The skin was covered with cold, clammy sweat;
body temperature was sub-normal; shivering and tremors present; had not
vomited or purged; urine suppressed; respiration stertorous; pulse 28
per minute and so feeble that it was almost imperceptible. Two full
doses of atropine were given hypodermatically as well as 10 cc. of ether
and 200 cc. of strong coffee with 20 cc. of rum were given by the mouth
and hot bottles applied externally. In spite of all this the symptoms
became worse and the patient sank into a condition of profound collapse,
the pulse dropping to 24 per minute and the tremors ceased. One liter (1
quart) of normal saline solution was injected hypodermatically and
improvement began in 15 minutes after the injection. The respiration
lost the Cheyne-Stokes character; the pulse improved in tension and in
an hour was 60 per minute; the skin improved and the temperature
returned to normal and the patient went to work next day.

The circulatory symptoms are most prominent and demand most attention.
Vomiting and purging have to be treated according to the conditions in
the individual case and no rule can be followed. As the peripheral
vessels are dilated the body temperature is usually subnormal. This
should be overcome by applying hot bottles externally.

The suppression of urine should receive attention, and the activity of
the kidneys be stimulated as much as possible. It is probable the
suppression is largely due to the tremendous fall of blood pressure. If
the urine is secreted but retained in the bladder it should be drawn
off.

Just as there is no simple way of detecting the presence of poisonous
mushrooms in a mixture of mushrooms, so there is no simple way of
destroying or removing the poisons. Pouchet stated that boiling
destroyed the poison and Chestnut has stated the poison of A. phalloides
is a toxic albumen. If this were the case boiling would destroy it. In
our experiments, however, boiling has not diminished the toxicity at all
and it can be definitely stated that the poison is _not_ an albumen.

There is also a popular impression that vinegar will remove the poison
and numerous observers claim to have removed the poison of A. muscaria
completely by soaking the fungus in vinegar. We have not had the
opportunity of trying this with fresh A. muscaria, but in one experiment
in which the A. verna was soaked over night in vinegar it failed to get
rid of the poison—any more than would have dissolved in that amount of
water.

Toadstool poisoning differs from most poisonings in the long time
elapsing before death in fatal cases. The only inorganic poisons causing
death after such a long interval produce profound tissue changes.
Husemann believed death from poisonous mushrooms to be due to fatty
degeneration of the various organs. We have examined microscopically the
tissue of dogs and cats dying from the _late_ effects of the A. muscaria
and A. phalloides and found them to be perfectly normal.

Mr. V.K. Chestnut, in a bulletin published by the United States
Department of Agriculture (Circular No. 13, p. 23), states that death
from the A. phalloides is due to a destruction of the red-blood
corpuscles. Upon what authority this assertion is made is not stated.
The conclusion has probably been based upon the venosity of the blood in
cases of poisoning resulting from the disturbance of the respiration and
circulation. The blood corpuscles of animals poisoned by all three of
the Amanitæ studied have been counted repeatedly in our experiments and
in _none of them has there been any appreciable reduction_.

It can be positively stated that death is not due to a destruction of
the red blood cells.

Further, the coloring matter of the blood (hæmoglobin), which carries
oxygen to the tissues, has been examined with the spectroscope to see if
any new compound had been formed which would prevent it from carrying
oxygen. No such compound has been found—no alteration could be detected
in the hæmoglobin. It is quite evident that these toadstools do not kill
by their action on the blood, for in a number of experiments the blood
was examined a very short time before death.

Thinking that they might act upon the nerve cells of the brain and
spinal cord very much as certain toxins of infectious diseases do, those
structures were examined by special staining methods (silver
impregnation), but no greater variation than is normal could be detected
in any of those examined.

No statement can be made as to the cause of this late death, but it
would appear to be due to some disturbance of nutrition.

Late death occurs not only in animals, but in most of the cases of
poisoning in man recorded in medical literature.

The contrast between the early and late symptoms is not so great in
poisoning by A. phalloides and A. verna as in the case of poisoning by
A. muscaria. In the first two the serious symptoms appear early and
continue till the end; in the last the early effects of the muscarine
soon passes off or can be removed by atropine, but the late symptoms,
strikingly in contrast with the early ones, still appear, and continue
till death.

                                RECIPES
                                  FOR
                  COOKING AND PREPARING FOR THE TABLE


Preparing toadstools for the table should begin while collecting them.
Have a soft brush, a knife, half a dozen one or two-pound paper bags and
an open-topped, roomy, shallow basket. [Sidenote: Collecting.
Cleansing.]As edible species are found, cut them loose well above their
attachment. Keep the spore surface down until the top is brushed clean
and every particle of dirt removed from the stem. This prevents dirt
from getting upon the spore surface, from which it is very hard to
dislodge. Never clean a toadstool over other toadstools. If the stem is
hard, tough or wormy, remove it.

Having cleaned the plant, place it in one of the paper bags, spore
surface down. Write its name on the bag. Place but one kind in the same
bag, unless species of about the same texture and flavor are found and
mixing is not objectionable. Where another species is found, give it a
bag to itself.

Select fresh, inviting plants only. Do all possible cleaning in the
field. [Sidenote: Selection]Plants keep clean, pack better, and more of
them can be carried. A careless jumble is gritty, bruised and
disappointing.

If not ready to cook the find, place the bags in the ice chest. It is
best to cook fungi as soon as possible. Cooked, they can be kept much
longer than when uncooked.

When ready to cook, wash the plants by throwing them into a deep pan of
water. [Sidenote: Washing.]Pass the fingers quietly through them upward;
let stand a moment for the dirt to settle, then gather them from the
water with the fingers as a drain. Remove any scurf or adhering dirt
with a coarse flannel or a cloth. Wash in this way through two or three
waters. Lay to drain. By experience in draining, exactly the amount of
water necessary to cook a particular species can be allowed to remain
within its spore surface, if it is a gilled species. To other kinds,
water must usually be added.

The removal of the skin of any toadstool is seldom justifiable. As with
the apple and most fruits, the largest amount of flavor is in the skin.

By the consistency of the species in hand, decide upon the best method
of cooking it and the time and medium required. If it is thin, juicy,
tender, from five to ten minutes' slow stewing will be ample; if it is
thick, dry, tough, from thirty to forty minutes will be required. After
any species is cooked tender, it may be seasoned to one’s liking and
served as one chooses.

Many species, which absolutely refuse to become tender after prolonged
stewing, quickly succumb in the frying pan and make crisp, delicate
morsels. Edible kinds which dry well, or are hard when found, often
grate or powder easily, and are excellent (after soaking) made into
soups, fritters or pâtés.

Hundreds upon hundreds of recipes for cooking the common mushroom and
the few other fungi heretofore eaten, are at hand. The simpler
methods—those which retain the natural flavor of the species cooked—are
the best.

When a species has good body, and but little flavor, it may be made
delicious by cooking with it another species of higher flavor.

The most concise instruction is: Cook in any way you can cook an oyster.

The writer’s best and long-tried recipes are here given. Mrs. Sarah
Tyson Rorer has kindly contributed some of her own choice methods; Mrs.
Emma P. Ewing, of culinary celebrity, is represented; and that every
recipe needed may be found herein, the most sensible of English and
French recipes are given.

                           TO COOK MUSHROOMS.

Gather mushrooms whenever they can be found. That is the best time of
the day to collect them. The gills grow darker and the flavor improves
as the spores ripen. They are in good condition up to the time the gills
begin to grow moist and to soften.

Cut off the extreme butt of the stem, holding the gills downward. Rub
off the cap and stem with a rough towel or flannel. Do not peel. Wash in
cold water. Drain well, gills downward.

The English method is to scald them, but there is more of custom than
use in it.

Mushrooms may be preserved temporarily by boiling them in salt and water
for five minutes, draining and wiping dry. A better way is to cook them,
place in ice-chest, and reheat when wanted.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

TO BROIL.—Use well-spread caps only. Use double iron broiler. Place the
caps on it, gills down, and broil two minutes, turn and broil two
minutes more. While hot, season with salt and pepper, and butter well,
especially upon the gill side. Serve upon toast.

                                                      _Mrs. S.T. Rorer._

                       BAKED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST.

Bake under a glass or basin, on toast along with scalded or clotted
cream or a little melted butter, and salt and pepper to taste. They take
about a quarter of an hour in a gentle oven or before a fire; when they
are taken up, do not remove glass for a few minutes; by that time the
vapor will have condensed and gone into the toast.

                                                              _Stevens._

                          CRUSTS OF MUSHROOMS.

Cut into small, even-sized squares a pint of the selected toadstool;
stew in a little water until done; add two ounces butter and one
teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Wet a teaspoonful
of flour with two gills of cream and mix with the beaten yolks of two
eggs. Add, and mix well with the toadstool.

Cut the upper crust from some small French rolls. Scoop out the inside
of both upper and lower part, brush them with melted butter and brown in
the oven; fill them, put on the top. Serve.

Or, when cooked as directed, serve in paper cases, or pastry shells.

                  TO DRY MUSHROOMS. (English method.)

Take those neither very young nor very old. Remove the butts only. Then
slice, string or skewer the slices lightly, and expose to a current of
warm dry air. A warm oven, with the door open, is a good place. When
quite dry and shrivelled, pack in tins, with spice at top and bottom.
When wanted for use, soak the slices in tepid water for some hours. Then
cook.

                                                                  _Hay._

                       STEWED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST.

Cut the mushrooms—caps and stems—into pieces of equal size. Place in a
covered saucepan. To each pint add one ounce (two level tablespoonfuls)
of butter. Enough water will have been retained by the gills after
washing to make sufficient liquor. Stew slowly twenty minutes; season to
taste with pepper and salt. Place upon toast.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                           TO FRY MUSHROOMS.

Lay them in a frying pan in which butter has been heated boiling hot.
After frying five minutes serve on a hot dish—pouring over them the
sauce made by thickening the butter with a little flour. This is as
delicious as more elaborate ways of cooking and retains the mushroom’s
distinctive flavor in full perfection.

                         FRICASSE OF MUSHROOMS.

Wash, put them into a chafing dish, sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt,
a quarter of a teaspoonful of black pepper, cover and cook slowly for
five minutes. Moisten a tablespoonful of flour in a gill of milk, strain
this into the mushrooms, bring to boiling point, add the yolks of two
eggs slightly beaten, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and serve at
once.

                                                      _Mrs. S.T. Rorer._

                           MUSHROOM PICKLES.

One-half peck of either Agaricus campester, Lepiota procera, Hypholoma
fascicularis, Hypholoma perplexum, Clitocybe multiceps, Russula
virescens. Select sound specimens, cut off ends of stems (entire stem of
fascicularis or procerus), rub the tops with flannel dipped in salt.
Throw them into milk and water (one-fourth milk). Drain and put them
into a stew pan. Sprinkle the layers with salt—one-half gill to one-half
peck mushrooms. Cover them close and put them over a gentle fire for
five minutes to draw out the water. Then put them on a coarse cloth and
drain until cold (or put on mosquito netting in a colander).

To prepare a pickle for them: Take one-half gallon vinegar (if strong
dilute with water), two ounces mace, one-fourth ounce cloves, one-half
pound salt (Worcester), one teaspoonful red pepper, one nutmeg cut in
slices.

Put in a jar covered with a wet cloth and keep the cloth wet. Place over
a very slow fire, cook as long as the acid is prominent _and no longer_.

Take small wide-mouthed bottles, fill with the mushrooms, pour on the
pickle until the bottle is filled. Tie down tight. (To slice a nutmeg,
boil it in vinegar—slice while hot. Makes of salt vary in strength; the
“Worcester” is a strong salt.)

N.B.—When H. fascicularis is used, wipe the tops with a wet cloth.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                 TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. (English style.)

Take buttons and remove butts only. Put into jars and cover with cold,
spiced pickling vinegar. Add a few peppercorns and mustard seeds and
seal hermetically.

                                                                  _Hay._

                           MUSHROOM CATCHUP.

Take the opened toadstools, clean carefully, bruise them. Put a layer on
the bottom of an earthen pan, strew salt over them (two tablespoonfuls
to one-fourth peck), another layer, more salt and so on. One-half ounce
cloves, one-half ounce mace, one-half ounce allspice, one-half ounce
whole pepper. Let stand six days. Stir every day. Then put in gentle
oven, cover pan with wet cloth, keep wet, and heat for four hours.
Strain through a fine cloth or sieve. To every gallon of liquor add one
quart red wine. Salt to taste. Add a race or two of ginger cut small.
Strain; let catchup get cold. Pour it from the settlings. Bottle. Cork
tight.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                           MUSHROOM CATCHUP.

A catchup superior to that sold in the stores may be made at home. Break
the toadstools into bits and place in a stone jar, with an ounce and a
half of salt for every quart of plants. Let stand in a cool place for
three days, stirring several times a day. On the third day put over the
fire, in a porcelain kettle, and heat slowly. In about half an hour the
juice will flow freely, when strain through a hair sieve, return to the
fire and boil twenty minutes. Measure the liquid and to each quart allow
an ounce of ginger root, a blade of mace, a bay leaf, a pinch of
cayenne, and an ounce each of allspice and black pepper; boil down to
one-half the quantity, add a teaspoonful of the best brandy to each
half-pint. Bottle. Cork and seal with wax or rosin.

                                                                 _Anon._

                   MUSHROOM CATCHUP. (English style.)

Remove the butts. Sprinkle all with salt. Pile in a bowl. Let them
remain so for three days, stirring occasionally. Then squeeze out all
the liquor. To each gallon of it add cloves and mustard seed, crushed,
of each half an ounce; allspice, peppercorns and ginger, crushed, of
each one ounce. Heat slowly up to boiling point in a covered vessel. Set
aside in a warm place for a fortnight. Then strain and bottle. If the
catchup shows signs of not keeping, add more salt and spice, heat and
proceed as before.

                                                                  _Hay._

                         CANNED MUSHROOM SAUCE.

Cook together, until a light brown color, two tablespoonfuls each of
butter and flour, add a can of button mushrooms, with the water it
contains, and a cupful of water or broth. Simmer five minutes, stirring
meanwhile, season and serve. The flavor of the mushroom is more distinct
and pronounced if the sauce is seasoned only with salt and mixed pepper.
If broth is used in the preparation of mushroom sauce instead of water,
it should be the broth of such meat as the sauce is to be served
with—for instance, chicken broth when to be served with chicken, beef
broth when to be served with beef, etc.

                                                   _Mrs. Emma P. Ewing._

                         FRESH MUSHROOM SAUCE.

Put in a graniteware or porcelain-lined saucepan two tablespoonfuls of
butter. When hot add two cups of fresh, prepared mushrooms, cover
closely, and cook briskly two or three minutes. Season to taste with
salt and pepper, and serve with broiled beefsteak, birds, or
sweetbreads.

                                                      _Mrs. E.P. Ewing._

                            TO COOK BOLETI.

Remove the stems, and the tubes unless they are compact and young, or
the dish will be slimy from the tubes. Wipe the caps clean.

TO BROIL.—Put on wire broiler or in a hot buttered pan. Cook well. Add
butter, pepper and salt.

TO STEW.—After cutting the caps in pieces of similar size, stew in a
covered saucepan for twenty minutes. Do not use much water. When done,
add butter, or cream, pepper and salt. Some persons may prefer to add a
little lemon juice or sherry.

TO BAKE.—Bake for half an hour in covered dish, add oil or butter, a
little parsley, and garlic if liked, pepper and salt.

TO FRY.—Remove the tubes from all the caps, excepting of very young or
very short-tubed species. Slice the caps as you would eggplant. Fry in
butter, oil or fat, or dip in batter or in egg crumbs.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

B. EDULIS SOUP (as made in Hungary).—Having dried some Boleti in an
oven, soak them in tepid water, thickening with toast bread, till the
whole be of the consistency of a puree, then rub them through a sieve,
throw in some stewed Boleti, boil together, and serve with the usual
condiments.

                                                               _Paulet._

TO DRY BOLETI (English method).—Gather in dry weather. Remove stems and
tubes. Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Slice. String the slices. Hang up
in a warm place for two days. Then give them a minute in a moderately
warm oven. Pack in tins with spice. When wanted steep the slices in
tepid water for some hours, till they swell. Then proceed to dress as
for fresh Bolets. The Russians retain the stems and dry their Bolets
whole, stringing them up the stem and through the center of the cap.

                                                                  _Hay._

                     TO COOK CANTHARELLUS CIBARIUS.

Cut the mushrooms across and remove the stems; put them into a
closely-covered saucepan with a little fresh butter, and sweat them
until tender, at the lowest possible temperature. A great heat always
destroys the flavor.

                                                          _Mrs. Hussey._

Wash, cut into pieces and put into boiling water; then stew with fresh
butter, a little olive oil, chopped tarragon, pepper, salt and a little
lemon peel; when cooked simmer over a slow fire for twenty minutes,
moistening from time to time with beef gravy or cream. When ready to
serve thicken with the yolk of egg.

                                                           _M.C. Cooke._

TO FRY.—Dip caps in egg and bread crumbs, season with pepper and salt
and fry in hot butter or oil.

TO STEW.—Cut the whole plant into small pieces across the grain, stew
slowly in a covered saucepan for forty minutes. Add thickened cream or
milk. Use freely of butter and season to taste.

TO ROAST.—Place in a hot dry pan over a slow fire, shake and turn until
the plants are crisp. Butter and season with pepper and salt. A fine
camp dish.

TO PRESERVE FOR WINTER USE.—Pull into strips one-half inch wide, spread
on a piece of mosquito netting and place in the sun or current of warm
air. When dry hang up in small bags or mosquito netting in a dry place.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                           TO COOK CLAVARIA.

Fry in hot butter, oil or fat until well done; or stew, covered with a
little water, over a slow fire for half an hour. When done add cream or
milk, a little flour, plenty of butter and season with pepper and salt.
Salt last, always, or it will harden the plants.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

TO PICKLE (English recipe).—Put the tender parts into jars with
peppercorns, mustard seeds and nasturtium seeds. Pour on them cold white
wine vinegar. Fill up and cork hermetically.

                                                                  _Hay._


                      TO COOK CLITOCYBE MULTICEPS.

TO BAKE.—Wash caps, remove stems, let drain for a few minutes; place
gills upward in a pan; place on gills a small-sized lump of butter;
season with pepper and salt; grate cheese over each layer, cover pan,
and place in hot oven to bake for one-half hour.

An exceptionally fine dish. They are excellent fried.

Other species of similar consistency may be cooked in the same way. See
Toadstools with Cheese.

                                                            _McIlvaine._


                           TO COOK COPRINUS.

“In regard to the C. micaceus I find that they are better cooked after
the following recipe:

“Trim the stems, wash the toadstools carefully through several waters,
then drain them in a colander. Spread them out in a long baking pan,
dust lightly with salt, pepper, put over a few bits of butter, cover
with another pan and bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five minutes.
Add four tablespoonfuls of cream, bring to boiling point; dish on toast.

“The C. atramentarius may be cooked in precisely the same manner. I find
that all these inky mushrooms are better cooked in a very slow heat in
the oven, and they must be covered or they lose their flavor.”

                                                      _Mrs. S.T. Rorer._

C. comatus, or any other Coprinus, may be treated in the same manner; or
they may be stewed slowly in a covered dish for from five to ten
minutes.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                              CROQUETTES.

To one pint of any well-cooked toadstool of meaty species, add two
hard-boiled eggs, a sprig of parsley; pepper and salt to taste; chop all
very fine, then take two level tablespoonfuls of butter and one of
flour, put over the fire with the toadstools and eggs; mix thoroughly
together, set aside to cool. When cold, shape, dip in egg and bread
crumbs, and fry in hot oil, butter or fat.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                          DEVILED TOADSTOOLS.

For deviled toadstools prepare the meat as for patties, adding the yolks
of two hard-boiled eggs to each pint of meat, a pinch of red pepper and
a little chopped parsley. Serve hot or cold in halves of egg shells,
nested among green.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                      TO COOK FISTULINA HEPATICA.

Mrs. Hussey says of it: “If it is not beef itself, it is sauce for it.”

It can be sliced thin and dressed as a salad with mayonnaise dressing or
otherwise.

The simplest and best way is to cut the fungus into slices as one would
egg-plant. If it is small, slice it into two parts, fry in hot butter,
season with pepper and salt.

Another favorite way is to slice the plant across the grain, cut into
squares of one-half inch and cook very slowly in a covered pan for
twenty minutes. Add a little water, and plenty of butter. Season with
pepper and salt.

The F. hepatica always has a slightly acid taste, which is very
acceptable to most persons, but objectionable to a few.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

SALAD.—Cut in thin slices and rub them with garlic. Mingle with lettuce
or other green salad. Dress with oil, vinegar, pepper, mustard and salt.
Serve.

                                                                  _Hay._


                      TO BROIL ANY CAPPED FUNGUS.

Select those that are spread open and keep the unopened for other styles
of serving. Cut off the stems close to the tops. Baste well with melted
butter and sprinkle lightly with pepper and salt. Heat the broiler very
hot, lay the caps upon it with the gills up and broil over a clear fire,
turning the broiler first on one side and then on the other. As soon as
tender, which will be in about five minutes, open the broiler, remove
the caps with care, and place on well-buttered slices of the toast which
have been previously prepared. Pour over the whole a sauce made of drawn
butter, or hot water thickened with flour to the consistency of cream.

                           FRIED TOADSTOOLS.

Take the caps only—one pint—well drained and carefully seasoned with one
teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful black pepper. Place in a pan
with one ounce of butter (a lump the size of a small egg). Fry slowly
for ten minutes. Add a little milk or cream thickened with flour. Serve
on hot toast.

                            TO COOK HYDNUM.

In cooking Hydnei care must be taken to cook slowly and well.

Use the tender parts only of stems and caps of the capped species, and
soft, fresh parts of the maned species; cut into small pieces of similar
size, stew slowly in covered saucepan for from thirty to forty minutes,
season with butter, pepper and salt. Serve.

Or, after stewing for forty minutes as above, drain off the water, chop
fine, make into croquettes or into pâtés.

                           A HUNTER'S TOAST.

Carry a vial of olive oil or a small can of butter, some pepper and salt
mixed. An edible toadstool found, collect a few dry twigs, fire them.
Split a green stick (sassafras, birch or spice-wood best) at one end;
put the toadstool in the cleft, hold it over the fire; oil or butter,
season. Eat from the stick.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                          TO COOK HYPHOLOMAS.

TO STEW.—Wash the caps, stew slowly in the water which the gills retain,
for half an hour, keeping dish covered. Add plenty of butter, pepper and
salt to taste, add cream or milk with a little thickening.

The Hypholomas have a slightly bitter taste, of which most persons
become very fond; if it is objectionable, add a small amount of lemon
juice or sherry.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

H. PERPLEXUM.—Put one dessertspoonful of vinegar in a quart of water.
Soak the caps in this mixture twenty minutes. Then take them out and
stew slowly for half an hour in a covered vessel, adding butter, pepper
and salt to suit the taste. A small quantity of onion is thought by some
to improve the flavor, and a thickening of flour and milk just before
serving is an improvement.

                                                      _Prof. C.H. Peck._

The above is given as recipe for cooking H. perplexum. It answers
equally well for the many Hypholomas resembling it.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

TO BAKE.—Wash caps, remove stems, let drain for a few minutes, place
gills upward in a pan, place on gills a small-sized lump of butter,
season with pepper and salt, cover pan, and place in oven to bake for
one-half hour.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                           TO COOK LACTARII.

The rich juices of the Lactarii are best retained by baking. The species
grow hard and granular if cooked rapidly. Baked they are excellent. This
method is preferable to stewing, but no one will despise a properly made
stew of them.


                       TO COOK MARASMIUS OREADES.

Remove the stems, wash the caps, place in a covered saucepan and simmer
for thirty minutes, adding sufficient water to prevent scorching; add a
little milk or cream, butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Or, simply fry in butter, make a gravy and season to taste.

TO DRY.—String the caps on threads and loop up in a dry place, and when
thoroughly dry place in tight glass jars or tin cases.

              TO COOK THE MORELL—MORCHELLA (from Persoon).

1. Having washed and cleansed them from the earth which is apt to
collect between the plaits or hollows of the plant, dry thoroughly in a
napkin and put them into a saucepan with pepper, salt and parsley,
adding or not a piece of ham. Stew for an hour, pouring in occasionally
a little broth to prevent burning. When sufficiently done, bind with the
yolks of two or three eggs and serve on buttered toast.

2. MORELLES A L'ITALIENNE.—Having washed and dried, divide them across,
put them on the fire with some parsley, scallion, chevril, burnet,
tarragon, chives, a little salt, and two spoonfuls of fine oil. Stew
till the juices run out, then thicken with a little flour; serve with
bread crumbs and a squeeze of lemon juice.

                                 PÂTÉS.

The toadstools good for croquettes and pâtés are such as the Puff-balls,
Lactarii, Gomphidius rhodoxanthus, Fistulina hepatica, Tricholoma
personatum and many others of the meaty kinds. Cut the toadstools into
small pieces, cook slowly until tender, adding butter, pepper and salt.
Let them cook almost dry, then add cream or milk and thickening. Fill
pastry shells and serve.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

A pretty effect is produced by dipping the rims of the shells in
partially beaten white of egg, then in finely-chopped parsley before
filling.

                      TO COOK PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS.

Remove tough stem-part, if any, and use only such parts of the plants as
seem fresh and tender.

TO STEW.—Cut in small pieces across the grain. Stew twenty minutes over
slow fire with a little water. Add cream or milk with a little
thickening; season with butter, pepper, salt.

TO FRY.—Cut into pieces about the size of a medium-sized oyster, dip in
egg and bread crumbs, and fry in hot butter or oil, as oysters are
fried.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

WITH CHEESE—_au gratin._—Cut into medium-sized pieces. Stew slowly,
rather dry, for fifteen minutes. Pour off liquor; save it. Place in
baking dish (or in individual dishes, clam shells, etc.) a layer of
ostreatus, buttering and seasoning each layer, sprinkle with bread
crumbs and grated cheese and so on until dish is filled, placing cheese
on top. Pour liquor over the dish. Place in slow oven and bake until
well browned.

This manner of cooking is a favorite. Any toadstool may be cooked in
this way.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

Wash. Put them into a chafing dish with one ounce of butter to each half
pound of plant. Sprinkle over half a teaspoonful of salt, cover the dish
and cook slowly for five minutes. Beat the yolks of two eggs with one
gill of good milk, lift the lid, add the mixture of eggs and milk; when
smoking hot serve. Do not allow the mixture to boil or the eggs will
become curdled.

RECIPE NO. 2.—Wash. Dust with salt and pepper, dip in egg, then in bread
crumbs and fry quickly in smoking hot olive oil.

The following recipe was given me by a chef:

“Put into the saucepan a tablespoonful of butter, add a clove of garlic,
a thin slice of onion, stir until slightly brown and add a tablespoonful
of flour. Mix carefully, add a quarter of a teaspoonful of beef extract
dissolved in half a cup of water and the same quantity of cream. Bring
to boiling point, add a tablespoonful of chopped carrot, a bay leaf, and
a blade of mace. Stand the mixture on the back part of the stove where
it will scarcely boil, for ten minutes. Strain and add half a pound of
ostreatus. Cover and cook for ten minutes. Serve on toast.”

                                                      _Mrs. S.T. Rorer._

                          TO COOK PUFF-BALLS.

TO FRY.—Remove the thin outer rind, slice, dip in egg and bread crumbs,
and fry as egg-plant; serve without tomato sauce.

TO STEW.—Cut in dice-shaped pieces, stew for fifteen minutes in a little
water, pour off the water, dust with a little flour, add a small
quantity of milk or cream, butter, pepper and salt and a little parsley.
Stew slowly for five minutes. Serve. These also may be served in pâtés.
When these are broken open they should be perfectly white inside; any
stains or yellow part should be removed, otherwise they will be bitter.


                                                            _McIlvaine._

SALADS.—Cut into strips, mingle with mustard and cress, or with blanched
dandelions, scallions and hard-boiled egg, and dress as ordinarily for a
salad. Or, amalgamate with potato salad a l'Allemande.

                                                                  _Hay._

                     TO COOK TRICHOLOMA PERSONATUM.

TO STEW.—Wash and cut into small pieces. Stew for thirty minutes. Pour
off the water, add milk slightly thickened, butter, pepper, salt and a
little chopped parsley.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                    TO STEW THE TOUGHER TOADSTOOLS.

                     (Hydnaceæ, Polyporaceæ, Etc.)

Cut into small pieces of even size. Soak for half an hour in tepid
water. Remove from water, do not drain; place in covered pan and simmer
for forty minutes. Add proper proportion of thickened milk or cream,
butter, pepper, salt.

Those who like may add parsley or nutmeg, or beef gravy; in fact, any
flavoring.

                                                            _McIlvaine._


                                SALADS.

Many species of fungi make good salads. The best of these are, Russulæ
when young, fresh and firm; either sliced raw or stewed and drained;
Clitocybe multiceps stewed and drained; Tricholoma personatum, raw or
stewed; Clitopilus prunulus, raw or stewed; Coprinus comatus, C.
micaceus, atramentarius, raw; Clavaria, fresh, young, brittle, either
raw or stewed; Fistulina hepatica, raw; any of the edible Polyporaceæ,
after stewing; any of the edible Hydnaceæ after stewing; the puff-balls,
raw or stewed. Any favorite species will make a salad.

After cooking allow to drain and cool; then mix with mayonnaise
dressing, or make a dressing to taste of oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.
Serve on lettuce.

                                 SOUP.

Dame Nature never made a soup. Soup is a human invention of more or less
distinctiveness. Usually it is a successful disguise or covering of
invisibility for something which furnishes the name.

To make two quarts of a distinctly fungoid soup take one quart of any
edible toadstools, carefully cleaned. Put in a well-covered boiler with
three pints of water, and boil slowly for one hour. Rub the whole
through a colander. Reject that which does not rub through readily. Add
one-half pint of milk thickened with one tablespoonful of flour, one
ounce of butter, a dessertspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of pepper.
Bring to a boil. Serve.

Any chosen thing or things may be added to the above—the toadstools can
not resent it.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                        TOADSTOOLS WITH CHEESE.

Several varieties of fungi are delicious when baked with a small
quantity of cheese grated upon them; notably Clitocybe multiceps, the
Hypholomas, Armillarias, Pleurotus ulmarius and ostreatus, Lentinus
lepideus and many Boleti. See recipe for baking. When several layers of
plants compose the dish, cheese should be grated on each layer.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                  BAKED TOADSTOOLS OF ANY GILLED KIND.

Wash, place the caps in a tightly covered dish or pan after dipping them
in bread crumbs. Lay them in layers, with a small piece of butter on
each toadstool, as well as the proper amount of pepper and salt. Bake
from twenty to forty minutes as suits the consistency of the species.
Serve on toast.

Or, the caps prepared as above, may be laid upon pieces of toast and
placed in the pan. If this plan is adopted the lower pieces of toast
become saturated with the liquor; therefore, in serving, cut from top to
bottom of dish.

See To Cook Clitocybe Multiceps.

                                                            _McIlvaine._

                              A CAMP BAKE.

Cover the bottom of a tin plate with caps, spore surface up. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper, place a bit of butter on each. Put another tin
plate on top. Set on coals or a heated stone for fifteen minutes. Eat.
No better baking will result in the best oven.

                               SUPPLEMENT
                      ONE THOUSAND AMERICAN FUNGI




                               PREFATORY


The first edition of “One Thousand American Fungi” so fully embodied the
species known to be edible, that the field for fresh investigation has
been confined principally to newly discovered species. In the eighteen
months elapsing since the publication of the first edition, Professor
Charles H. Peck—the American authority upon fungi—has reported several.
These, with his descriptions, are named in the supplement.

The many requests made of the author for information upon the raising of
mushrooms show a prevalent interest in the industry. What he knows is
stated herein; what he does not know, and what is not known upon the
subject, would furnish the matter for a volume.

Interest in the study of fungi is well established and is rapidly
increasing. This department of botany has been made a specialty in many
colleges and schools. Its importance is everywhere recognized.

The author and publishers feel a just pride in the success of “One
Thousand American Fungi.” The prompt sale of the first edition, and
immediate demand for the second, warrant it. Their thanks are due to the
many who have kindly interested themselves in obtaining subscriptions to
the author’s edition.

                                                      CHARLES MCILVAINE.

                                SUPPLEMENT


[Sidenote: Amanita.]

  =Amanita Frostiana pallidipes= n. var. (See A. Frostiana, page 16.) In
  his report of the New York State Botanist for 1899, Prof. Charles H.
  Peck describes a new variety of Amanita Frostiana as follows:

  The typical form of this species, which is common in our cool northern
  woods, has the pileus and annulus, and usually the stem also, of a
  yellow color, that of the pileus sometimes verging to orange. But in
  warmer and more open or bushy places forms occur in which the whole
  plant is whitish, but in other respects has the characters of the
  species. Sometimes the pileus is pale-yellow and the stem and annulus
  white. The warts are soft and flocculent, are sometimes numerous and
  persistent, and again are few or wanting. The form with yellow stem
  and annulus and yellow or orange pileus may be considered the typical
  form of the species, but forms having the stem and annulus pale or
  white may be designated as variety pallidipes. _Peck,_ 53d Rep. N.Y.
  State Bot.

  Undoubtedly POISONOUS. _McIlvaine._


[Sidenote: Lepiota.]

  =Lepiota Morgani= Pk. (See page 37.) The majority of mycophagists are
  immune to the poison of this species. Yet many cases of severe, but
  not fatal poisoning by it came within the writer’s knowledge during
  the season of 1900–1901.

  A valuable report is contained in a letter from George B. Clementson,
  attorney, Lancaster, Wis.:

  “* * * Lepiota Morgani has grown in this locality this season in
  unusual abundance. While I was absent last week, my father picked a
  number, mistaking them for L. procera, and my mother, in preparing
  them for the table, ate a small piece of the cap of one—a piece, she
  assures me, no larger than a hickory nut. About two hours afterward
  and shortly after dinner (at which the mushrooms were not served, and
  at which nothing indigestible was eaten) she experienced a peculiar
  numbness and nausea, with constriction of the throat. Vomiting set in
  within half an hour and was excessive, lasting several hours and
  giving no relief. She was very greatly weakened and thought herself
  dying, being so reduced at one time that she was unable to see.
  Purging set in not long after the vomiting. The constriction of the
  throat did not disappear until after the vomiting stopped.

  “Whisky and nitroglycerine (by the stomach) were given to keep up the
  heart’s action.

  “It seems probable that the poison itself did not directly affect the
  heart, but that the alarming weakness was due to the vomiting and
  purging. That is my mother’s own opinion. After being in bed for a day
  she was able to get around, but suffered considerable pain in the
  abdomen for forty-eight hours.

  “I presume that owing to the fact that my mother is not very strong
  and has a weak stomach, she was more violently affected than many
  might be. But a poison that in any person can produce such symptoms,
  when taken in so small a quantity, ought to be labeled decidedly
  dangerous.

  “There can be no question that the specimens were L. Morgani, as I
  examined some that were left of those picked, and also gathered others
  from the same patch where these were obtained.

  “As everything relating to mushroom poisoning should be of interest to
  the mycologist and mycophagist, I take the liberty of reporting this
  case.”

  The Lepiota Morgani appears to be spreading. In 1901 I found large
  specimens of it outside a stable in Lebanon, Pa. Its appearance and
  luxuriance are so much in its favor, that the toadstool lover will be
  tempted to try it. Experiments in eating it should be conducted with
  the greatest caution.

  LEPIOTA CLYPEOLARIA PK.
  About one-half nat. size. After Peck.

  =Lepiota clypeolaria= (Bull.) Fr. Shield Lepiota. (Plate II.) =Pileus=
  thin, soft, convex or subcampanulate, becoming nearly plane, obtuse or
  umbonate, squamose, whitish or yellowish, the center or umbo smooth,
  yellowish or brownish, the margin often appendiculate with fragments
  of the veil. =Flesh= white. =Lamellæ= thin, close, free, white. =Stem=
  slender, equal or slightly tapering upward, hollow, fragile, pallid,
  adorned with soft, loose, white or yellowish floccose scales or
  filaments. =Spores= oblong or subfusiform, 12–20µ long, 6–8µ broad.

  The cap of the shield lepiota is at first somewhat ovate or
  bell-shaped, but with advancing age it becomes convex above or nearly
  flat. It is white or whitish, but spotted with numerous small scales
  of a yellowish or brownish-yellow color. These scales are the result
  of the breaking up of the thin cuticle that covers the very young
  plant, and they have the same color as it. A small space in the center
  is brown or yellowish-brown, or darker than the rest of the cap,
  because the cuticle covering it remains unbroken and retains its
  color. The center in some specimens is more prominent than in others,
  giving what is called an umbonate cap. The margin of the cap is
  sometimes shaggy, specially in young plants, by the adhering fragments
  of the whitish veil.

  The gills are thin, closely placed side by side and rounded at the end
  next the stem, but they are not attached to the stem. They are white.
  The stem is rather long and slender, fragile and adorned with loose,
  soft fibrils or flocculent, cottony tufts, which give it a somewhat
  shaggy appearance, but it becomes smoother as the plant grows older.

  The cap is usually from 1–2.5 inches broad, and the stem from 1.5–3
  inches long and 1.5–3 lines thick. The plants grow in woods, specially
  in hilly and mountainous regions, and are generally solitary or few in
  a place, but in favorable seasons they are of frequent occurrence and
  may be found from July to October. Though small and thin, the caps are
  well flavored and make a desirable dish. _L. metulaespora_ B. and Br.
  scarcely differs from this species, except in the striate margin of
  its cap. _Peck_, 54th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


  =Lepiota naucinoides= Pk. (See page 45.) This valuable food species is
  spreading and rapidly increasing in many of the states. Prof. Charles
  H. Peck, in 54th Annual Report of the New York State Museum, says of
  it: “It has shown considerable variability in some of its characters.
  Usually its pileus is very white and smooth, clean and attractive, but
  specimens have been found this year having the pileus dingy or smoky
  brown, others have been seen in which the cuticle of the pileus was
  cracked in such a way as to form minute squamules, and in one or two
  instances plants were observed having the surface of the pileus
  adorned with minute granules, a character attributed to _L. naucina_
  Fr. In such cases the importance of recognizing the spore characters
  is shown. By disregarding this character our plant has sometimes been
  referred to _L. naucina_ and sometimes to _Agaricus cretaceus_ Fr.,
  both of which it closely resembles, and with which it appears to be
  confused by European mycologists, some referring it to one species and
  some to the other.”

  The species named are equally excellent.

  CLITOCYBE PATULOIDES PK.
  About two-thirds nat. size. After Peck.
]

  =Clitocybe patuloides= Pk. (Plate III.) =Pileus= fleshy, firm, rather
  thick, convex, becoming nearly plane or somewhat centrally depressed,
  glabrous, even and white when young, with the margin incurved,
  becoming pale ochraceous with age and often squamose or rimosely
  areolate. =Flesh= white, taste mild, odor like that of mushrooms.
  =Lamellæ= thin, close, slightly or strongly decurrent, forked or
  anastomosing at the base, white. =Stem= usually short, equal or
  slightly tapering upward, solid, white. =Spores= broadly elliptic,
  6–8µ long, 5µ broad.

  =Pileus= 1–4 inches broad. =Stem= 1–3 inches long, 4–12 lines thick.

  Gregarious or cespitose. Woods, especially of pine. When growing in
  tufts the stem is often eccentric and the pileus irregular. The base
  of the stem is often white tomentose. Its agreeable odor and mild
  taste led to a trial of its edible qualities, but it developed a
  bitter taste in cooking. _Peck_, 54th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


  =Clitocybe Adirondackensis= Pk. Adirondack Clitocybe. =Pileus= thin,
  convex or nearly plane and umbilicate, or centrally depressed and
  funnel-form, glabrous, moist, white or pale tan color. =Flesh= white.
  =Lamellæ= thin, narrow, close, very decurrent, white. =Stem= nearly
  equal, glabrous, stuffed or hollow, colored like the pileus. =Spores=
  subglobose or broadly elliptic, 4–5µ long, 3–4µ broad.

  The Adirondack clitocybe is common in the northern forests of the
  state, but is not limited to them. Its cap is thin, and soon becomes
  nearly flat with a decurved margin and a central depression or
  umbilicus, or very concave by the elevation of the margin, and then it
  resembles a wineglass in shape. Its margin is sometimes wavy or
  irregular. In color it varies from white to a very pale red or tan
  color. White specimens sometimes have the center slightly darker than
  the rest.

  The gills are very narrow, being scarcely broader than the thickness
  of the flesh of the cap. They are closely placed, white and decurrent.

  The stem is nearly cylindric, smooth and stuffed or hollow. It is
  colored like the cap. Often there is a white tomentum or cottony
  substance at its base.

  The cap varies in size and is 1–2 inches broad; the stem 1.5–3 inches
  long and 1–2 lines thick. It may be found from July to October. Its
  flavor is suggestive of that of the common mushroom. _Peck_, 54th Rep
  N.Y. State Bot.


  =Clitocybe maculosa= Pk. Spotted Clitocybe. =Pileus= fleshy, convex,
  often centrally depressed, glabrous, centrally marked with numerous
  small round spots, yellowish-white, the young margin involute and
  minutely downy. =Flesh= white, taste mild. =Lamellæ= narrow, close,
  very decurrent, whitish or slightly yellowish, some of them forked.
  =Stem= equal or slightly tapering upward, glabrous or sparingly
  fibrillose, stuffed, sometimes becoming hollow, whitish. =Spores=
  subglobose or orbicular, 4–5µ broad.

  The peculiar mark by which the spotted clitocybe may be distinguished
  consists in the small round definite spots in the central part of the
  cap. They have a slightly darker or watery or yellowish color and
  appear as if depressed below the rest of the surface. The cap is
  smooth and whitish or yellowish white and is generally depressed in
  the center and decurved on the margin. The margin is usually adorned
  with slight, short radiating ridges. The flesh is white and the taste
  mild.

  The gills are closely placed side by side, narrow and prolonged
  downward on the stem. They have nearly the same color as the cap. The
  stem is nearly cylindric, smooth or adorned with a few silky fibrils,
  whitish and spongy within or sometimes hollow when old.

  The cap is from 1–3 inches broad; the stem 2–3 inches long and 2–4
  lines thick. This mushroom grows among fallen leaves in woods. It
  appears in August and September. I have found it in the Adirondack
  forests only. Its range is probably northward, and its rarity detracts
  from its importance as an edible species. _Peck_, 54th Rep. N.Y. State
  Bot.


  =Hygrophorus lauræ= Morg. =Pileus= fleshy, convex and umbonate, then
  expanded and depressed, more or less irregular, glutinous, white,
  clouded with a reddish or brownish tinge especially on the disk.
  =Stem= solid, more or less curved or crooked, tapering downward,
  yellowish-white; the apex scabrous with scaly points. =Lamellæ=
  unequally adnate-decurrent, distant, white. =Spores= pellucid,
  elliptic, apiculate, .0083×.0055µ.

  Growing in rich soil among the leaves in hilly woods. Pileus 2–4 in.
  broad, stipe 2–4 in. long and ½ an inch thick. This is a much larger
  plant than _H. eburneus_, has a wash of red or brown upon the disk,
  and is covered with a thick gluten. It is more like _H. cossus_, but
  has no odor. Journal Cincinnati Soc. Nat. Hist. Vol. VI, 180, 1883.

  =Lactarius subpurpureus= Pk. Purplish Lactarius. (Plate IV. See page
  172.) “When fresh, their taste is slightly acrid, but, when they are
  cooked, it is scarcely inferior to that of _L. deliciosus_.” _Peck_,
  54th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.

  I had not seen this species when the first edition of this work went
  to press, consequently could not report its edible qualities. The
  favorable testing by Professor Peck adds weight to the opinion I have
  frequently expressed, that acridity of species when raw is no evidence
  whatever that they are harmful. Acridity usually disappears in
  cooking.


  =Lactarius distans= Pk. Distant-gilled Lactarius. =Pileus= firm,
  broadly convex or nearly plane, umbilicate or slightly depressed in
  the center, with a minute velvety pruinosity, yellowish tawny or
  brownish orange. =Lamellæ= rather broad, distant, adnate or slightly
  decurrent, white or creamy yellow, the interspaces venose, milk white,
  mild. =Stem= short, equal or tapering downward, solid, pruinose,
  colored like the pileus. =Spores= subglobose. 9–11µ broad.

  The distant-gilled Lactarius is similar to the orange Lactarius in
  color, but in other respects it is quite distinct. The short stem,
  widely separated gills and pruinose surface of the cap are distinctive
  features. The cap is broadly convex and often has a small central
  depression or umbilicus. In some cases it becomes nearly plane or even
  slightly funnel-shape by the spreading or elevation of the margin. The
  surface, specially in young and in well-developed specimens, has a
  soft pruinose or almost velvety appearance to the naked eye, and when
  viewed through a magnifying glass it is seen to be covered with minute
  persistent granules. The surface is sometimes wrinkled and frequently
  it cracks in such a way as to form small angular or irregular areas.
  The color is a peculiar one, varying somewhat in shade, but with tawny
  hues prevailing. It has been described as yellowish tawny and brownish
  orange. The flesh is white or whitish and has a mild taste.

  The gills are wide apart, somewhat arched in specimens having a convex
  cap and slightly decurrent in those with fully expanded or centrally
  depressed caps. Their color is white or creamy yellow and in old and
  dried specimens they have a white pruinosity as if frosted by the
  spores. The milk is white and mild.

  The stem is short, rarely more than an inch long, and is cylindric or
  tapering downward. It is solid and colored and clothed like the cap.

  The cap is 1 to 4 in. broad; the stem is usually about 1 in. long, 4
  to 8 lines thick. It is found in thin woods, bushy places and pastures
  from July to September. It is similar to the orange Lactarius, _L.
  volemus_, in its edible qualities. _Peck_, 52d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


  =Russula rugulosa= n. sp. Rugulose Russula. =Pileus= rather thin,
  fragile, convex, becoming nearly plane or centrally depressed, viscid
  when moist, roughened or uneven with small tubercles and rugæ, even on
  the margin when young, becoming tuberculate striate with age, the
  viscid pellicle separable on the margin. =Flesh= white, reddish under
  the cuticle, taste tardily acrid. =Lamellæ= rather close, adnate or
  slightly rounded behind, white. =Stem= nearly equal, spongy within,
  white. =Spores= white, rough, subglobose, 8–10µ broad, shining in
  transmitted light.

  The rugulose russula is closely related to the emetic russula, but
  differs from it in the uneven or rugulose surface of the cap, in the
  tardily acrid taste and in its closer adnate gills. Its cap is red,
  varying from pale-red to dark-red, viscid when moist, even on the
  margin when young, but somewhat tuberculate and striate when old. Its
  surface is roughened by minute tubercles or pimples, which sometimes
  appear to run together and form short ridges. These are sometimes
  absent from the center of the cap. The viscid cuticle easily peels
  from the margin of the cap, but not from the center. The flesh is
  white, except just under the cuticle, where it is reddish. It is soft
  and fragile, and its taste is slowly and much less sharply acrid than
  in the emetic russula. Its gills are closely placed, attached to the
  stem and persistently white. The stem is brittle, soft and spongy
  within, smooth and white. The cap is 2–4 inches broad, the stem 2–3
  inches long, 4–8 lines thick.

  It grows in woods among mosses and fallen leaves or on the bare
  ground, and appears in August and September. It is an inhabitant of
  the Adirondack forests. Its slightly acrid flavor is destroyed in
  cooking, and it affords a harmless, tender and agreeable food. _Peck_,
  54th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


  =Russula abietina= n. sp. Fir Tree Russula. =Pileus= thin, fragile,
  convex, becoming nearly plane or slightly depressed in the center,
  viscid when moist, the viscid pellicle separable, tuberculate striate
  on the margin. =Flesh= white, taste mild. =Lamellæ= subdistant,
  ventricose, narrowed toward the stem, rounded behind and nearly free,
  whitish, becoming pale yellow, the interspaces venose. =Stem= equal or
  tapering toward the top, stuffed or hollow, white. =Spores= bright
  yellowish ochraceous, subglobose, rough, 8–10µ broad.

  The fir tree russula is closely related to the youthful russula, _R.
  puellaris_ Fr., from which it is separated by the viscid cap, the
  gills rather widely separated from each other and nearly free, the
  stem never yellowish nor becoming yellow where wounded, and the spores
  having an ochraceous hue. They are much brighter and more highly
  colored in the mass than the mature gills. The cap varies much in
  color, but the center is generally darker than the rest. It may be
  dull purple or greenish purple with a brownish or blackish center, or
  sometimes with an olive green center, or it may be olive green or
  smoky green with a brownish center. Olive green and purplish hues of
  various shades are variously combined, but sometimes the margin is
  grayish and the center olive green. The flesh is white and its taste
  mild. The gills are white when young, or barely tinged with yellow,
  but they become pale yellow with age. They are neither crowded nor
  widely attached to the stem, and are connected with each other by
  cross veins, which can be seen at the bottom of the interspaces. The
  stems are rather slender, soft or spongy, sometimes becoming hollow
  and occasionally tapering upward. They are very constantly and
  persistently white. The =cap= is 1–2.5 inches broad, the =stem= 1–2.5
  inches long, 3–5 lines thick. This russula grows under or near pine,
  spruce or balsam fir trees. It occurs from July to October. It is
  tender and palatable. The stems also are tender and may be cooked with
  the caps. _Peck_, 54th Rep. N. V. State Bot.

  CANTHARELLUS CINNABARINUS PK.
  About one-half nat. size. After Peck.
]

  =Cantharellus cinnabarinus= Schw. Cinnabar Chantarelle. (Plate V.)
  =Pileus= firm, convex or slightly depressed in the center, often
  irregular with a wavy or lobed margin, glabrous, cinnabar red. =Flesh=
  white. =Lamellæ= narrow, distant, branched, decurrent, red. =Stem=
  equal or tapering downward, glabrous, solid or stuffed, red. =Spores=
  elliptic, 8–10µ long, 4–5µ broad.

  The cinnabar Chantarelle is readily recognized by its color. It is
  externally red in all its parts, the interior only being white. It is
  a small species but often quite irregular in shape. Small specimens
  are more likely to be regular than large ones. Sometimes the cap is
  more fully developed on one side than on the other. This makes the
  stem eccentric or in some cases almost lateral. The color is quite
  constant, but in some instances it is paler and approaches a pinkish
  hue. It is apt to fade or even disappear in dried specimens. The gills
  are blunt on the edge as in other species of this genus. They are
  forked or branched, narrow and decurrent.

  The stem is small, smooth and usually rather short. It is generally
  solid, but in the original description it is characterized as stuffed.
  The cap is 8 to 18 lines broad; the stem 6 to 12 lines long and 1 to 3
  broad. It grows gregariously in thin woods and open places and may be
  found from July to September. It sometimes occurs in great abundance,
  which adds to its importance as an edible species. The fresh plant has
  a tardily and slightly acrid flavor, but this disappears in cooking.
  In Epicrisis, Fries referred this species to the genus Hygrophorus,
  and in Sylloge also it is placed in that genus, but it is a true
  Cantharellus and belongs in the genus in which Schweinitz placed it.

  =Cortinarius corrugatus= Pk. Corrugated Cortinarius. (Plate VI.)
  =Pileus= fleshy, broadly campanulate or very convex, viscid when
  moist, coarsely corrugated, bright-yellow, reddish-yellow, tawny or
  ochraceous. =Flesh= white. =Lamellæ= close, pallid when young,
  becoming tawny with age. =Stem= rather long, equal, hollow, bulbous,
  pallid or yellowish, the bulb viscid and usually colored like the
  pileus. =Spores= broadly elliptical, rough, 11–16µ long, 8–10µ broad.

  The corrugated Cortinarius is a well-marked and easily-recognized
  species, quite distinct from its allies. Although the color of the
  pileus is variable, its viscid, corrugated surface and the viscid bulb
  of the stem afford distinctive and easily-recognized characters.
  Sometimes the corrugations or wrinkles anastomose with each other in
  such a way as to give a reticulated appearance. The color varies from
  yellow to reddish-tawny or reddish-ochraceous. The margin in young
  plants is incurved.

  (Plate VI.)

[Illustration:

  CORTINARIUS CORRUGATUS PK.

  There is a variety in which the cap is adorned with darker-colored
  spots or scales. This bears the name, variety _subsquamosus_. In all
  other respects it is like the species.

  The gills are closely placed side by side. They are at first of a pale
  hue, but assume a darker and more definite tawny color with age. They
  are usually minutely uneven or eroded on the edge and transversely
  striate on the sides. They are slightly narrowed toward the stem.

  The stem is generally a little longer than the width of the cap. It is
  commonly smooth, but sometimes sprinkled near the top with minute
  yellowish particles and adorned below with a few fibrils. It is hollow
  and has a distinct viscid bulbous base, the viscidity of which is a
  peculiar feature. This bulb in the very young plant is even broader
  than the young cap, that at this stage of development appears to rest
  upon it. The color of the bulb is usually like that of the cap, but
  the stem is commonly paler than either.

  The cap is 2 to 4 inches broad, the stem 3 to 5 inches long, 3 to 8
  lines thick. The plants are gregarious in woods and bushy places, and
  may be found from June to September. It sometimes grows in
  considerable abundance, and as an edible species it is not to be
  despised. _Peck_, 52d Rep. N.Y. State Bot.


  =Agaricus hæmorrhoidarius= Schulz. Bleeding Mushroom. The bleeding
  mushroom is easily recognized, when fresh, by the red color assumed by
  wounds of the flesh either of the cap or stem. This character is also
  found in the seashore mushroom, _A. maritimus_, a species that has a
  solid stem and has not yet been found growing far from the sea. The
  cap is generally some shade of brown, but sometimes when young it is
  white. It is adorned with darker fibrils or scales, though these
  sometimes become obscure or disappear with age. When young it is
  hemispheric or very convex, but it soon becomes broadly convex or
  nearly flat, with the center either slightly depressed or somewhat
  prominent. The flesh is generally whitish or grayish white when first
  exposed to the air. It assumes the red color rather slowly and after a
  time loses it again.

  The gills are pink or rarely whitish when young, but become brown or
  blackish brown with age. The stem is long or short, cylindric or
  tapering upward, sometimes slightly thickened or bulbous at the base,
  sometimes not. It is hollow, but the cavity small, at first fibrillose
  and more or less adorned with floccose scales toward the base, but
  these generally disappear with age, and the primary white color of the
  stem is apt to become darker with age. The collar is membranaceous and
  at first conceals the gills. It is persistent, silky and white or
  whitish, sometimes tinged with brown.

  The =cap= is 2–4 inches broad; the =stem= 2–4 inches long, 3–5 lines
  thick. It grows in woods or bushy places and seems to prefer damp soil
  rich in vegetable mold. It may be found from August to October. It
  sometimes grows in clusters. It gives to milk in which it is stewed a
  brownish color. Its flavor is similar to that of the common mushroom.
  A variety in which the stem is commonly shorter and the pileus of a
  darker smoky brown color is sometimes abundant in low damp ground on
  Long Island. It may be called _variety fumosus_. _Peck_, 54th Rep.
  N.Y. State Bot.


  =Agaricus abruptus= Pk. (A. silvicola Vitt., A. arvensis var. abruptus
  Pk.) (Plate I, page 722.) Agaricus abruptus Pk. is described on page
  343 as A. silvicola Vitt. It is very common in the woods of West
  Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1901, I found
  it in Rockingham Co., N.C. The probabilities are that its spread is
  extensive.

  Being the wood cousin of the field mushroom (A. campester) it deserves
  more than ordinary attention. It is found during months which do not
  favor the growth of the mushroom. It is equally good, though not so
  fleshy. It gives the true mushroom flavor to less flavored edible
  species when cooked with them.

  When seen at a distance, growing in the woods, it has the appearance
  of an Amanita, but the color of the gills, which are never white after
  the cap opens and become as the spores ripen a blackish brown,
  distinguishes it at once. Neither has it a volva.

  The excellent photograph of the species, taken by the late Dr. J.R.
  Weist, Richmond, Ind., presents a life-like picture of it.

  =Boletus granulatus albidipes= n. var. “Under pine trees. Westport.
  October. This variety differs from the typical form of the species in
  having the flesh of the pileus white, except next the tubes, where it
  is faintly yellowish, the stem white externally and internally, and in
  having a slight membranaceous veil which forms a very thin annulus on
  the stem of the young plant, or forms fragments which adhere to the
  margin of the pileus.” _Peck_, 54th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

  For typical form B. granulatus, see page 416.


  =Boletus chrysenteron albocarneus= n. var. White Flesh Boletus.
  =Pileus= fleshy, convex above, dry, subglabrous, varying from brick
  red to bay red. =Flesh= white, sometimes tinged with red near the
  surface; tubes rather long, adnate or slightly depressed around the
  stem, greenish yellow, their mouths small, subrotund. =Stem= equal or
  nearly so, solid, subglabrous, colored like or a little paler than the
  pileus, white within.

  The white flesh boletus is quite common in the Adirondack forests and
  quite constant in its characters. I have not seen it with yellow
  flesh, though in other respects it agrees very well with the
  description of _B. chrysenteron_. The cap is not often cracked, but,
  when it is, the cracks are sometimes red, sometimes yellowish, though
  the flesh is constantly white except just beneath the cuticle, where
  it is sometimes reddish. The tubes are long and greenish yellow. They
  are at first nearly plane in the mass, but with the expansion of the
  cap the mass often becomes ventricose. The mouths of the tubes are
  small and nearly round. Wounds or bruises of the mass become bluish or
  greenish blue. The stem is firm, solid and colored like the cap,
  though it is sometimes a little paler.

  The =Cap= is 1–2.5 inches broad; the =Stem= 1–2 inches long, 2–4 lines
  thick. The trial specimens were fried in butter and found to be
  harmless, palatable and digestible. _Peck_, 54th Rep. N.Y. State Bot.

                       RAISING MUSHROOMS AT HOME


  By the courtesy of the publishers of The Woman’s Home Companion, the
  author is permitted to republish his article, “Raising Mushrooms at
  Home,” which appeared in the October, 1901, number of that excellent
  monthly—encyclopedic in all home matters.

  In October is the time to prepare the manure and beds for
  house-raising of mushrooms. During the warm months they can not be
  cultivated without trial of one’s temper and test of one’s taste. Any
  one having control of a cellar can raise a fine crop of expectations,
  and may raise a crop of mushrooms by either accident or experience.
  They are at all times the most contrary of growths, and require the
  nicest management and much patience. The first thing to do is to
  select a well-ventilated spot away from direct drafts, where the
  temperature can be maintained at from fifty to sixty degrees and a
  moist atmosphere assured. Thoroughly cleanse the cellar and give it an
  entire covering of whitewash.

  Decide upon the size of bed desired. In width the bed should not
  exceed reaching distance to its center when there is a pathway on each
  side of it, say six feet. The length of the bed should reach to its
  useful stopping-place. If the cellar has a portable heater in it, and
  is warm, the bed should be ten to twelve inches in depth; if the
  heater is walled in, or the cellar is cool, the bed should be fifteen
  inches deep.

  Calculate how much fresh horse-manure, with the long straw only
  removed from it and that has not been rained upon, it will take to
  make a bed of desired dimensions solidly tramped. Get it, put it in a
  compact heap, and keep it covered from rain. It will heat rapidly and
  get smoking-hot, because a fermentation sets in which produces heat.
  If loam can be procured from a pasture or elsewhere it is well to add
  one-fifth (in bulk) of it to the manure, mixing it thoroughly. This
  addition retards the fermentation and absorbs the ammonia—a valuable
  fertilizer—which would otherwise be driven off by the heat. It also
  takes up any surplus of moisture.

  After the compact pile has been thus prepared it should stand two or
  three days, then be well forked over and again piled. This forking
  should be repeated from four to six times, at intervals of from two to
  four days, depending upon the use or not of loam, which affects the
  rapidity of heating. If loam is used the forking should be at longer
  intervals unless the heat becomes excessive. The manure will probably
  then be in good order to go into beds. It is upon proper, careful
  preparation of this medium that successful mushroom-raising greatly
  depends. All work and hopes are thrown away if the greatest care is
  not exercised. Just as it is folly to buy poor seeds upon which to
  expend costly labor, so it is folly to make beds of poorly prepared
  manure.

[Illustration: BRICK CUT FOR PLANTING.]

  The manure must neither contain too much nor too little water. By far
  the largest percentage of failures is due to too much. It rots the
  spawn vine (mycelium), and thus destroys the starting place of the
  fruit, or mushroom. The object in forking the manure so frequently is
  to sweeten it (as the operation is called) and to prevent overheating
  from fermentation. If it gets too hot it “burns”—gets too dry.
  Molding, too, is avoided. Moldy manure will not produce. If, in
  forking over the pile, dry places are found, they should be sprinkled
  with water; if, when the fermentation grows less active, the manure is
  too wet, spread it out to air and dry somewhat. It is in good
  condition and properly moist when tight squeezing will not press water
  from it. Far better that it should be too dry than too wet. The manure
  now ready should be moved to the cellar and made into beds while warm.

  Good ventilation is a necessity. Two thermometers are needed—one to
  mark the temperature of the cellar, the other to place well and
  solidly down in the bed to record what it is doing in the heat way. It
  is probable that the mercury will rise slowly. It may go as high as
  one hundred and twenty-five or one hundred and thirty degrees. Do not
  disturb the bed, however high it goes. When it falls to between ninety
  and eighty degrees plant the spawn. If possible, keep the temperature
  up for several days. It should then fall slowly to sixty degrees, but
  go down no farther. Never plant on a rising temperature.

  Mushroom-spawn comes in brick-shaped blocks. They can be purchased, of
  good quality, from any reliable seedsman. These blocks are made of a
  mixture of dungs, through which the mycelium, or vine, from which
  mushrooms grow, has been run. After this mixture is filled with the
  vine (badly named spawn) it is pressed into blocks and dried. It
  should be kept dry until used. Spawning a bed is nothing more than
  placing cuttings of this exceedingly fine vine under the influence of
  moisture and heat in a soil fitted for its growth (such as the bed
  should be), then inducing it to run and fruit. Spawn is originally
  made to grow by planting the seed of mushrooms in specially prepared
  dungs and germinating them. The mycelium, or vine, coming from this
  germination is called “virgin spawn,” and is perpetuated in its growth
  by running (training) it through manures, pieces of which form the
  spawn of commerce.

  With a sharp hatchet cut the bricks into twelve pieces of equal size;
  a fine, clean meat-saw may be used, as it reduces breakage. With the
  hand make holes in the bed ten inches apart each way. These holes must
  be so deep that when the lumps of spawn are thrust firmly down into
  them the top of the lumps will be not less than one inch or more than
  two inches below the surface of the bed. Cover the lumps firmly. Have
  the surface of the bed as even as possible. Without having to go very
  far into the cold region of mathematics, the number of bricks of spawn
  needed is easily figured. Ascertain the number of holes, ten inches
  apart, that can be made in the bed. Divide this number by twelve, and
  lo! you have it.

  After the bed is spawned it is well to lay a double thickness of
  newspapers over it, putting a few plastering-laths or light sticks
  upon them to keep them in place. This is to keep the heat in the bed,
  as it is desirable that the temperature should not run down too
  rapidly. It should be two weeks falling to sixty degrees.

  Ten days after spawning, if the heat of the bed has gone down to
  sixty-five or sixty degrees, cover the bed with two inches of loam and
  pat it solid with spade or board. The bed should not be covered with
  loam when the temperature is too high. Removing the papers will allow
  the heat to escape. At the time of covering with loam the spawn should
  have begun to spread. It will show plainly in the manure close to the
  lumps of spawn. Its odor is unmistakable, being musky, spicy, much
  like mushrooms, but stronger. Care should be taken not to disturb the
  new mycelium, as all breakage of the fine, web-like threads lessens
  its product. The mycelium should start and grow quickly up to the time
  of covering with loam. After that a slow increase is best. To effect
  this the surrounding outside temperature should be from fifty-seven to
  sixty-two degrees. Ventilation should be upward and good, but not
  directly upon the bed.

  The mycelium will now run and completely fill the bed. Minute white
  nodules will appear upon the threads of it; these are the beginnings
  of the mushrooms to come. In from seven to eight weeks after spawning
  tiny button mushrooms should appear on top of the bed. If the cellar
  has been cool it may be a few days longer. Mr. Falconer says, “If the
  temperature of the bed falls below fifty-seven degrees, and the
  atmospheric temperature below forty-five degrees, the beds should be
  covered with matting or other material.” Newspapers will do. Upon the
  appearance of the mushrooms is the time a moist atmosphere is needed.
  This is obtained by sprinkling the walks and cellar well with warm
  water. This moisture should be kept up all the while the crop is
  growing. Unless the fruiting beds show a marked dryness they should
  not be watered. If watering is required, do it very carefully with a
  fine rose or syringe. Have the pure water at ninety degrees, and do
  not more than moisten the loam covering. Never let the water settle in
  pools or wash the surface.

  After the bed is in bearing the addition of strong, liquid manure
  plentifully applied between the bunches (never on them) will add to
  their weight and size. It should be done with a long spout without
  rose. A sprinkling of salt on bare places is beneficial.

                          GATHERING THE CROP.

  The mushrooms will now show in various sizes, from pin-head to large,
  full-grown specimens, singly and in dense clusters. As fast as they
  reach the desired size twist them from their sockets. Do not cut or
  pull them. Keep the gills downward, to prevent dirt getting in them.
  Take care not to disturb those left in the beds more than is
  necessary. It is unnecessary to add, cook them, but it is very
  necessary to tell how, because many excellent cooks commit the
  outrageous sacrilege of peeling mushrooms. A large amount of the
  flavor and deliciousness of a mushroom is in the skin—as it is in the
  apple. One might just as well peel a strawberry. First, always holding
  the plant gills downward and not over others, cut away the extreme
  base of the stem and brush off any adhering dirt. If the cap shows
  much scruff, rub it off with a piece of coarse flannel or cloth. Throw
  the mushrooms thus cleaned into cold water; they will float. Run the
  fingers through them several times, then lift them to a fresh pan of
  water, wash them and place them, gills downward, on a cloth to drain,
  or put them in a colander. Then cook them to taste. Here, again,
  sacrilege is frequent. Many foods are simply mediums for added
  flavors. Not so the mushroom; it has a decided, exquisite flavor of
  its own. It should not be made in cooking to taste like something
  else. Put the mushrooms in a stew-pan with a little water; cover them,
  and stew slowly for twenty minutes, adding butter, salt and pepper to
  taste. Cream or milk may be added. Another very good way is to butter
  well a medium-hot pan; cut the mushrooms into equal-sized pieces, put
  them in it, cover, and fry. Stir them from time to time, and when
  quite done season with salt and pepper. A good gravy is made for them
  by using water, milk or cream. Now if you must have a meat of some
  sort, put the meat on one dish and the mushrooms on another. By doing
  this you spoil the taste of neither.

  Beds will continue to produce for several weeks if properly cared for.
  As soon as they cease bearing remove them, clean up, white-wash,
  coal-oil every inch of wood, salt the floor, and be ready to try
  again. After the amateur has his or her hand in, the bed area can be
  largely increased by building rough berths, one above the other, in
  which beds can be made. An important bit of advice is: Start in a
  small way. Do not expend any more money than you can afford to lose.




                            Transcriber’s Note

  This is a complex text, with a great deal of structure, which
  occasionally lapses. In general, the text is given as printed, except
  that minor lapses of the conventional punctuation have been silently
  corrected. Where the author’s intent is unclear, the notes collected
  here will indicate the resolution, if any.

  The text proved difficult to outline, with different sections adopting
  various schemes. The only class contained here is FUNGI.

  In each Genus section, the 'Analysis of the Tribes' tabulation
  indicates one or more subsections to follow, keyed by one or more
  asterisks. Frequently, these references have no corresponding
  subsection. In general, this scheme is unreliable.

  On p. 34, the outline entry ‘_B._ PILEUS VISCID. NEITHER SCALY NOR
  WARTY’ almost certainly refers to the incorrectly lettered and titled
  section on p. 49, ‘_A._ CUTICLE VISCID. NEITHER SCALY NOR WARTY.’. The
  ‘cuticle’ is an attribute of the ‘pileus’.

  As examples, on p. 133, there are no asterisks on the references to
  the Collybarii or Mycenarii, but one asterisk appears in the
  subsection Collybarii directly below. On the other hand, there is no
  matching subheading for Mycenarii.

  On p. 271, the reference '* Ægeritini. _P. ægerita_, the type of the
  section,' in the Table of the Tribes has no matching section.

  Where the subsection references have matching subsections, hyperlinks
  have been included to facilitate navigation.

  There are number of issues associated with the many illustrations.

  There is a parenthetical reference on p. 142 to Plate XXXV_a_ on the
  same page, which does not exist in the text, nor in the List of
  Illustrations.

  On p. 216, the page reference for Plate CXXXVI, fig. 4 was omitted.
  The correct page (p. 508) has been provided.

  On p. 319, Plate LXXXVIa (_Cortinarius autumnalis_) is mislabeled as
  LXXXVIb. Plate LXXXVIb (_Cortinarius annulatus_) appears properly on
  p. 320.

  Plates LXXXIX, CXXIII, CXXVII and CLVII are missing from both the List
  and the text.

  On pp. 569–570, the quotation marks associated with the passage “The
  botanical description of Gastromycetes, given by M.C. Cooke, is ... by
  various transformations of the peridium.” are confused. They are given
  as printed here.

  On p. 664, the reference to MONOCOTYLEDON in the entry for ENDOGEN has
  no corresponding entry.

     p. xxiii   The Clavariaceæ—branched or              Missing,
                club-shaped[—]often found                but
                                                         likely.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
