Abstract 

Let a be an algebraic integer satisfying a monic irreducible polynomial A{t) € Z[<]. The algebraic 
integers contained in Q(a) form a ring which we shall denote hyTla- It is known that if Co = disc(yl) 
then Ha C — Z[q], where disc(>l) is the dtscnmtnant of A. Let /? be a root of a prescribed monic 

Co 

irreducible polynomial B{u) G Z[Q][ii]. Let the algebraic number field Q(a)(/?) be given as the field 
Q(a) extended by /?. We denote by T^ofl the algebraic integers contained in Q(a)(/?). In this paper, 
we present an algorithm to compute an integer Cp such that 

-R-aP C -1—Z[a][0]. 
OoO^ 

The algorithm takes 0(6|,^^ log i5^ + '^^) arithmetic operations where 6^ and Sb are the degree 
of A and B respectively. With this result, we generalize the Lenstra's algorithm [6] for factoring 
polynomials over algebraic number field. Our algorithm computes the factorization of univariate 
polynomials over algebraic number field Q(pi)(p2) ■ ■ {Pz) where pj (j = 1, . . . , 2) is recursively de- 
fined as follows: pi is an algebraic number and pj is algebraic of degree > 2 over Q{pi){p2) ■ ■ ■ {pj-i)- 
The number of arithmetic operation and the binary length of integers required by this algorithm are 
polynomial in the degree and the LOG of the coefficients of input polynomials.

1 Introduction 

Throughout this paper, we denote by 6f the degree of an univariate polynomial F. For any poly- 
nomial F = Z)ffo<^'^' € ^W' ^* denote by ||F1|2 the value of yYi^.locf and by F^^ the value 
of inax{co,ci, . . .,Cj,}. Let a be an algebraic integer satisfying a monic irreducible polynomial 
A{t) e Z[t]. The algebraic integers contained in Q(a) form a ring which we shall denote by Tva- It 
is known that if Ca = disc(yl) then Ka C — Z[q], where di8c(.4) is the discrimtnant of A. Let 
/3 be a root of a prescribed monic irreducible polynomial B{u) € Z[q][u]. Then is an algebraic 
integer (see [3]). Thus, Z[a][/3] is a domain of algebraic integers (see [5]). Let the algebraic number 
field Q(q)(/?) be given as the field Q(a) extended by /?. We denote by Hap the algebraic integers 
contained in Q(q)(/?). Clearly, Tlaff is a ring and Z[q][/?] C TZaff- Our problem is to find an integer 
Cp such that 

-R-ap C —L_Z[a][y3]. (1) 

In fact, we can translate a double extension to a simple extension and then compute a discriminant to 
get an integer Cap such that TZa^ Q -p, — Z[a][/?]. However, this method takes arithmetic operations 
0((5^5g). We call this method the naive algorithm. In this paper, we present an algorithm to 
compute the Cp. It only takes 0{{)\hA log 5^ + 6^) arithmetic operations. Furthermore, the integer 
Ca& produced by the naive algorithm has binary length 

But, the integer CaCff produced by our algorithm has binary length 

0(5A<5fl(Iog6B + ^A log^max + log Smax))- 

Therefore, our algorithm is much better than the naive algorithm. Note that we haven't defined 

Smax • -Bmax is defined as follows: 

Definition If B{u) = J2'=q Uto' bija'u^ , then B^^ = max{6.,;0 < i < 8a,0 < j < 6b].

The following typed variables will be used: 

1. a,/3, (T,<,£, A,T,r, * are algebraic integers. 

2. a,b,c,d,e,i, j,k, I, Tn,n,w And Ca,C0, Co, are integers. 

3. Tla,'JZa0,'^<ri <7, are domains of algebraic integers. 

4. A, B, E, F, G are univariate polynomials over algebraic integer domains. 

5. D, K, N are integers. 

6. L is a lattice. 

In Section 2, we briefly describe the naive algorithm and analyze it. Section 3 contains the main result 
of this paper. In Section 4, we extend our result to the algebraic number field Q{<ti){(T2) ■ ■ {(Ti), 
where aj {j = 1, . . . , z) are recursively defined £is follows: 

{(Ti is an algebraic integer 
(2) 
<7j is integral of degree > 2 over Z[(Ti][<T2] • • • [f;-!]- 

With this result, we generalize the Lenstra's algorithm [6] for factoring polynomials over algebraic 
number field. Our algorithm computes the factorization of monic squarefree polynomiab over alge- 
braic number field Q(o-i)(<T2) ■ • (cr^). The number of arithmetic operation and the binary length 
of integers required by this algorithm are polynomial in the degree and the LOG of the coefficients 
of input polynomials. Of course, our algorithm is better than the naive algorithm by translating a 
multiple extension to a simple extension and then factoring over the simple algebraic extension of 
the rational number field. 

2 The Naive Algorithm 

Let A,B,a,0,'Ra be as in section 1. The following is a well known result.

Lemma 1 If Ca = d\sc{A), then V.^ C 7^Z[q]. 

In the naive algorithm, we first compute an integral polynomial B(u) € Z[u] such that /? is a root 
of B{u). Let B(t,u) be a bivariate polynomial obtained by replacing a in B{u) by t. Thus B{t, u) 6 
Z[t][u]. By [3, page 185], we can take B(u) = re8,(>l(t), B(t, u)) where re8,(yi,B) denotes the 
resultant of /I and B with respect to t. Then, compute a bivariate polynomial G{t, y) = resu(.i(/ - 
yu), B(u)); and then compute an integer j/o such that di8c(G(<, yo)) 5^ 0. From Loos [3, page 185], 
G{t,yo) has a root 7 = + yo0 and Q(7) = Q(q)(/3). If we let Cap = di8c(G(t, j/o)). then clearly, 
by Lemma 1, we have Tlap C -:;—Z[j] C ——Z[a]\j3]. 

Ca0 Ca0 

Because B{u) has degree Sa^b, the bivariate polynomial G{t,y) has degree S^Sb with respect 
to variable t or variable y. Thus, it takes 0{6\8q) arithmetic operations to compute disc(G(<, yo))- 
When regarding G{t, y) as a polynomial in t over Z[y], let F{y) = di8c(G(<, y)). Thus, Ca0 = ^(yo) 
and F{y) has degree 8\6g. We may compute yo to be the smallest positive integer such that 
F{yo) / 0. For the best caise, this will takes 0(6^6g) arithmetic operations; for the worest csise, it 
takes 0{8]^6g) arithmetic operations since F(y) has 6\6g roots. If we choose yo to be the smallest 
integer such that yo > 1 + Cmax> then F(yo) ^ since 1 + Cmax is the root bound of F{y). But, in 
this case. Cap = F{yo) may be very large. 

To analyze the binary length o(Ca0, we need the following theorem which is a generation of the 
result of Goldstein and Graham [4]. 

Theorem 2 Let A{xi,X2, ■ ■ ■ ^x^) = {AiK.{xi,X2, ■ ■ . ,Xz)) be a n x n matrix whose elements are

Definition. Let 7^ be a ring and x an element of some field F containing TZ. We shall say that y 
is integral over TZ, or for short Ti-integral, if the element x satisfies an equation 

with coefficients a^ G 72., and an integer n > 1. x is said to be integral of degree n over 72 if x 
doesn't satisfy any nonzero monic polynomial over 72 of degree less than n. 

Let yl, 5,a,^, Co,72<, be as in section 1. Obviously, /? is Z[a]-integral. Let (^ 6 72a0- Then C is 
also Z[a]-integral since ^ is Z-integral. We may find Ci,e2, . . .,£sb ^ ^l'*] *"d *" integer e ^ such 
that regarding each £; as a polynomial in a over the integers we have no common factor amongst 
all the coefficients of these polynomials and 

Suppose /?!,..., /3{g are all the roots of B. Let

for j = l,2,...,<5fl. The last system of equations may be considered as a system of equations in 
f<e~' € Q(a) for i = I,..., 63- If we denote its determinant by A, then A^ = disc(fl). Since 
disc(5) G Z[q], a is integral over Z[q], not necessarily lying in the field Q(q)(/3). But Cramer's 
rule shows that the numbers Ti = Ac,e~' are integral over Z[a) since both and C are integral 
over Z[a]; thus AT^ are also integral over Z[q]. But AT,- = A^£,e~' = di8c(fl)c,e~' are in Q(a); 
so that AT, are in TZ-o; hence AT, G — ;-Z[a]. It follows that e divides all the numbers Ca^^^i for 

Co 

j = I,. . .,6b- Although we have no common factor amongst all the coefficients of Cj (i = 1, . . .,63), 
it does not follow that e divides CoA^. When multiplied by Ci, A^ could produce a common factor 
in the coefficients even though neither A^ nor £i had any common factor in their coefficients. 

Example 1 Suppose A(t) =t^ + 2t + 2. Then, a^ + 2a + 2 = 0. If A^ = q+4 and fi = 3a + 2, then 
either A^ nor £, had any common factor in their coefficients. But A" • £i = (q + 4)(3a + 2) = 8q + 2 
which is divided by 2. 

Let r = E>=o' CjoJ e Z[q]. Define a map 4> : Z[a] — Z[t] by 

Let F be the image of A^ under and let F{t) = w ■ G(t) where Git) is the primitive part of F{t). 
Clearly, w is the content of F{t). We will show that e divides €„ ■ w ■ Tes(A, G). 

Theorem 4 Suppose G{t),A(t) G 2[t] are two primitive polynomials in t and suppose A(i) is monic 
and 6g < 6a. Let E{t) G Z[t] be an arbitrary primitive polynomial with 6b < 6a. If an integer c 
divides the remainder of G{t)E{t) divided by A{t), then c divides res{A,G). 

Proof Let F{t) be the remainder of G{t)E(t) divided by A{t). For convenience' sake, we need the 
following definitions. Let Ai{x) G Z[t] [i = l,...,m) be polynomials and let 6a, < m. Then 
mAt{Ai,A2, ...,Am) denotes the m x m matrix whose (i, m - j)th entry is the coefficient of x^ in 
Ai(i). We denote by det(^i, yl,, • ■ ■ ,^m) the determinant of mat(X,, yl,, • ■ • , >4„,).

Then, we can write 

res{A,G) = det(x*°-M, x^'^-^A, ...,A, x^^-^G, x'*-^G, ...,G). 

Let E{t) = E'=o«.''- We have, for i =z 0,1, ... ,6e, 

e, • res(yl, G) = Cj • det(x*°-M, x*°-M, ...,A, x'^-'C, x'^'^G, . . . , G) 
= det(x'°-M, x'°-M yl, x*^-'G e.x'G G) 

For all j ^ i, < j < 6e, adding the (m — «)th row by the product of Cj and the (m — j)th row, we 
have 

ei ■ res{A, G) = det(x*°-M, x*°-'^A, ...,A, x*>'-'G x'+*G, GE, x'-'G, . . . , G). 

For j = 1, . . . ,^0. subtracting the (m — i)th row by a multiple of the jth row such that the sequence of 
row operations correspond to the long-division of G(t)£'(<) by A{t), we eventually reduce eires{A,G) 
to 

a ■ res{A, G) = det(x*°-M, x*°-M, ...,A, x*^-'G, . . . , x'+'G, F, x'-^G, . . . , G). 

If c divides F{t), then clearly c divides all the a • re8(.4,G), for t = 0,1, ... ,Se- But, E{t) is 
a primitive polynomial so that Ci (» = 0, l,...,^^) don't have common factors. It follows that c 
divides res(.4, G). D 

Theorem 4 implies that e divides Ca ■ w ■ res(i4, G). Let C^ = w ■ Tes{A, G). We obtain e divides 
CaCp and 

CCaC0 = (CaCp- e-'){e,/f + ■ ■ . -(-e^^/J^B-i) ^ zlaM. 

Hence, TZap Q - - Z[a][/?]. We have shown the following theorem.

It takes 0(6g) arithmetic steps in Z[q] to compute disc(5). But, to perform one arithmetic step 
in Z[q] needs O(6^1og<5x) integer arithmetic operations. Thus, to compute disc(B) takes integer 
arithmetic operations 0(6g6y{ \og6A)- And, it takes integer arithmetic operations 0{6^) to compute 
res(j4(<), G{t)). Hence, The overall arithmetic steps needed for computing Cp is 0(6^6^ log 6a +6^ )• 

By Theorem 2, |di8c(S)| < 6^/'\B^^A>^*^y^ . Thus, Cp < Si^'^iB^^A^C^)*"'* . Hence, the

Lemma 6 Suppose £ is an arbitrary element tn Zfcijfcro] • ■ • [cTj] such that regarding £ as a poly-

Proof. We prove by induction on j. 

Basis: If j = 1, then this lemma is equivalent to Theorem 4. 

Inductive steps: Suppose 2 < j < i. Let E{xj) be the image of e under 4>j and let F(xj) be the 

remainder of Gj{xj)E{xj) divided by Sj{xj). Clearly, F{<Tj) = Tj ■£. Then, we can write 

res(Sj,Gj) = det(i'°^-'Sj,x*°^-^Sj Sj,x^^>-''Gj,x^^>-^Gj, . . . ,Gj). 

Let E{xj) = Ylilo^kx^. We have, for k = 0.l 6e,

For all / :^ it, < / < 6£;, adding the (m — /t)th row by the product of £i and the (m — /)th row, we 
have 

For I — 1, . . . , 6g, , subtracting the (m — k)ih row by a multiple of the /th row such that the sequence 
of row operations correspond to the long-division of Gj(xj)£'(xj) by Sj{xj), we eventually reduce

£t.res(S,,G,) = det(x''°.-i5;,x*°.-25;,...,5;,x«^-iG;,...,x*+'G,,F,x*-'G,,...,Gj). 

When we regard (Tj , <T2, . . . , ctj as indeterminates, if e divides Tj ■ £, then e divides F{xj), so that e 
divides all the £k ■ res(5j,G;), for k = 0,1,. . .,6e- Thus, according to Algorithm 2, e divides all

follows that e divides d\ ■ d2 ■ ■ dj^i ■ res(Si(xi), Gi{xi)). D 
Proof of the correctness o/(3). We prove by induction on z. 
Basts: U z = 1, then (3) is equivalent to Lemma 1. If z = 2, then (3) is equivalent to Theorem 5.

I (2). In this section, we discuss the case of j = 2. It is easy to extend the C2ise of z = 2 to the 
general case. 

Let A, B, a, 0, Ca,C0, TZa0 be as in section 3. Let / 6 Q(a)(/?)[x] be a monic squarefree polyno- 
mial. Then we can write / € — Z[o][/3][r]. We want to choose a positive integer D such that / and 

a 

all the monic factors of/ in Q(a)(/?)[x] are in — Z[q][/?][x]. The following lemma has been shown 
by Weinberger and Rothschild [8]: 

Lemma 7 (Weinberger and Rothschild) Let g(x) 6 -V-aph] be momc, and suppose g{x) = 

d 

v{x)w{x) G Q(a)(/3), where v{x),w{x) are monic. Then v{x),w{x) G -TZaB[x]. 

d 

Since Z[q][/?] C Tlaff, we have f(x) € -TlapWi- Hence, by Lemma 7, the monic factors of 

a 

f{x) will also be in -Tlapix]. Thus, by (1), the monic factors of f{x) will be in Z[a][/?][x].

Therefore, we can take 

D = dCaC0 

such that / and all the monic factors of/ in Q(a)(/?)[x] are in ■T^Z[a][/?][x]. 

The remainder of this section is similar to [6]. We choose p aa a prime number such that 

p does not divide D • disc(,4) • disc(B) ■ re8(/, /'), 

Let k be some positive integer. We denote by Zp the field of integers modulo p and by Z^,* the 
ring of integers modulo p*. Since p and D are relatively prime, for any c G T^Z, (c modulo p) and 
(c modulo p*) exist. For F = ^ c,t' G 7^Z[t] we denote the polynomial J^,(ci modulo p*)t* G Zp» [t] 

i 

by F/p» and denote the polynomial ^,{ci modulo p)<' G Zp[t] by Ffp. 

Using Hensel's Lemma and Berlekamp's algorithm [1] for factoring over finite fileds, we can 
construct a polynomial H G Z[<] such that H satisfies the following conditions: 

H is monic, (4) 

Hipk divides Ajpu in Zp»[<], (5) 

Hfp is irreducible in Zp[<], (6) 

(H/p)^ does not divide A/p in Zp[<] (7) 

We denote by Zj,^ the finite field Zp[t]/{H/p) and by ZJ,» „ the ring Zpk[t]/{H/pk). For F = 
'^Fi{t)u' G -TrZ[<][u] we denote by F/p ^ the polynomial 5Zi(^<7p modulo H/p)u' G Zp ^^[u] and 

i 

by F/pk H the polynomial X)i(^i7p» modulo H/pk)u' G Zp» j^[u]. Note that the working ring of each 
modulo operation depends on its operands. 

By Hensel's Lemma and Berlekamp's algorithm [2], we can also construct a polynomial H G 
Z[a][u] such that 5 satisfies the following conditions: 

E is monic, (8)

—/p,H is irreducible in Z'^[u], (10) 

{E/p^h)^ does not divide B/pH in Zj,^[u] (11) 

We denote by Z^^^^ the finite field Z;^[u]/(H/p,„) and by Z^^^^ the ring Z^.^[u]/(E/pV//)- For 

F = 2J Fi(t,u)x' e -T^Z[<][u][x] we denote by F/pHs the polynomial ^i{Fi/p h modulo H/p //)r' 6 

t 
Zp"//,= H and by F/pkH,s the polynomial ^i{Fi/pi.n modulo E/p»,//)i' e ZJ,^^^^. 

Again, by Hensel's Lemma and Berlekamp's algorithm [2], we construct a monic polynomial 

h € 7TZ[a][^][z] such that h satisfies the following conditions: 

h is monic, (12) 

/«/p',//,H divides //p*,/f,H in Z^^^^^, (13) 

h/p,H,3 is irreducible in Zp"^3[z], (14) 

{h,p,H.E? does not divide //p.^.n in "Z'p^^.bI^] (15) 



Let n = 6j and / = 6^ and let m be an integer such that I < m < n. We define L as the 

1_ 
D' 



collection of polynomials g G — Z[a][/?][x] such that: (i) 6g < m, (ii) if i5j = m, then \esLd(g) 6 Z, 



where lead(ir) denotes the leading coefficient of flr, (iii) /i/p»^= divides g/pi. h,s in Z'" y^=[x]. We 
identify such a polynomial 

m— 1 6b — i ^A — i 

i = /i=0 i/ = 

with the (m • (5b (Jyi + l)-dimensional vector (oooo, aooi, ■ ■ ■ , aoo«^-i, ■ • • , am-i.SB-i,s^-i,amoo)- We 
define |(/| to be 2-norm of the vector g and define g^ax to be oo-norm of the vector g. It is not 
difficult to see that L is a lattice in (_)"»*s*>»+i. From the fact that E and H and h are monic, it 
follows that a basis of L is given by: 

{^p''ct''0^x' : < u < Sh ,0 < fi < 6s,0 < i < 1} U 



Multiple Extension Algebraic Number Fields 16 

{1q''-<"//(q)/?*'x' : Sh < I' < 6a,0 < fi < 6^,0 < i < 1} U 
{^q''0>'-^^E{0)x' ■.0<u<6AjB<ii<6B.0<i<l]U 
{La''0>'hx'-' ■.0<u <6y^,0<^l<6B,l<i<m}U 
{hx-—} 

Let q = m ■ 6b ■ 6a + i- We identify the above basis with vectors 61,62,... ,6, 6 (7^)'- Then 
61, 62,..., 6^ are linearly independent. The following theorem directly follows from A. Lenstra and 
H. Lenstra and Lovasz [7, (1.11), (1.26), (1.37)]. 

Theorem 8 Let N > 2 be an integer such that |D6j|^ < A^ for j = 1,2, ... ,q. There is an algorithm, 
called LLL algorithm, that determines a vector b £ L such that b belongs to a basis of L, and such 
that |6p < 2'~'|Ap for every A G L, A 7^ 0; the algorithm takes 0(q*\ogN) elementary operations 
on integers having binary length O(q\og N). 

Let ho € ttZ[q][/?][x] be the unique monic irreducible factor of / such that h/p,H.B divides 
/»o/p,H,s in Zj,"^^[x] and let Q^ax = 1 + -4m« and /J^ax = 1 + (5^Smaxamax- Then, |q| < a^ax and 
\0\ < /?max- Theorem 9 and Theorem 10 are the generalization of [6, (3. 6), (3. 11)]. 

Theorena 9 Let b £ L satisfy 

(l>/max((n + l)^M.5Ba^-V^^aJ ')')'" (ob^.Aim + l)6A6Ba'r,^^'l3'm^^')"y . (16) 
Then b is divisible by ho in Q[a]\j3][x], and in particular gcd( f,b) ^ 1. 
Theorem 10 Suppose that b is as m Theorem 8, and that

Then we have 6^ < m if and only if (16) is satisfied with b replaced by 6. 

In (17), every variable is known except it and m. We calculate the leaist positive integer it for 
which (17) holds with m replaced by n — 1. After it is determined, H, 3 and h can also be obtained. 
Note that Sh and 6= can be determinated without knowing it. Then we run the following loop:

Suppose, after running the previous procedure, m = mo. If mo < n — 1, then a vector b was found. 
We know from Theorem 10 that Sh^ < rriQ. Since we try the values m = /, /+1, . . . , n— 1 in succession 
we also know that 6^^ > mo — 1, so Sh^ = mo. By Theorem 9, ho divides 6 in Q[a][/?][a;] which 
implies, together with (5j < mo, that (5j = mo. Since ho is monic and, by the definition of lattice L, 
lead(6) G Z, we have b = c ■ ho, for some constant c G Z. But ho & L and 6 belongs to a basis of L. 
We conclude that c = ±1, so that b = ±/io. 

If on the other hand mo = n, then we did not find a vector 6 satisfying (16). By Theorem 10, 
6ho > n — 1; so that 5/,„ = n. With ho being a factor of /, we have ho = /. 

Now, we know how to compute an irreducible factor of /. The following procedure completely 
factors a monic squarefree polynomial / 6 Q[o][/^] [•<*]•

With Theorem 8, the number of arithmetic operations needed for Procedure factoring is 0{n^6\6g +
