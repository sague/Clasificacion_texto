TESTIMONIALS. 



From T. J. Jackson, Professor of Natural and Experimental Philo- 
sophy, Virginia Military Institute. 

" Froin an examination of various portions of Major D. H. Hill's Algebra, in 
manuscript, I regard it as superior to any other work with which I am 
acquainted on the same branch of science." 



From a Teacher of Mathematics. 

" Having also examined several chapters of Major Hill's Algebra, I have no 
hesitation in concurring in the above opinion of Professor Jackson." 

WILLIAM Mclaughlin. 



From J. L. Campbell, Professor of Natural Science, Washington 
College, Virginia. 

" While I fully concur with Professor Jackson and Mr. McLaughlin in the 
opinion they express of Major Hill's Algebra, I will add, that I regard the 
method adopted by the author, of incorporating into the work some of the 
elementary principles of the Calculus, as giving it peculiar value as a college 
text-book." 



From William Gilham, Professor of Chemistry and Geology, Virginia 
Military Institute, and late Professor at West Point, iV. Y. 

" Having read the greater portion of Mnjor Hill's Algebra, I consider it as 
better adapted for use as a college text-book than any work on the subject with 
which I am acquainted." 



From Professor J. A. Leland, late Professor of Mathematics in the 
State Military Institute of S. C. 

" I have examined with care, many of the proof sheets of Major Hill's Algebra, 
and it affords me pleasure to concur in the favorable opinions above expressed."

IV TESTIMONIALS. 

This work of Professor Hill's is the product of a mind intensely in love with 
Algebra. It bears the marks of unremitting and intelligent toil. It is exhaus- 
tive on the subjects it treats ; and, in the abundance and aptness of its illustra- 
tious, reminds one of the richness and simphcity of Euler.

ELEMENTS OF ALGEBRA 



Article 1. — A mathematical principle is a truth admitted as self- 
evident, or proved by a course of reasoning called a demonstration. 
Thus, it is a self-evident principle, that if equals be added to equals, 
the results will be equal. But it requires a demonstration to show that 
if the sura of two quantities be added to the difference of those quanti- 
ties, the result will be equal to twice the greater quantity. 

2. Science is knowledge gained by theory or experiment, employed 
in the investigation of principles. Art is the application of acquired 
principles to the practical purposes of life. 

3. Quantity is anything that can be measured or numbered. A 
thing is said to be measured when its magnitude is expressed in terms 
of the unit of measure, and is said to be numbered when this unit is 
unknown or indefinite. 

Thus, 12 bushels of corn is a definite measure, the unit of measure 
being one bushel of corn. But a quantity, expressed by the number 
12, or even by 12 bushels, would only be numbered, for it might be 12 
bushels of gold, or 12 of flour, or 12 of anything else. 

Lines are quantities, becaiise they can be measured in terms of 
yards, feet, inches, &c. Time is quantity, being measured by hours, 
minutes, seconds, &c. The unit of measure for time is generally the 
second. 

The operations of the mind, such as hope, fear, joy, grief, &c., are 
not quantities. For, although we speak of a great hope and a small 
hope, there is no definite unit of comparison by which to measure its 
magnitude. 

Numbers are not quantities, but simply the agents by which to 
express the abstract relations between quantities of the same kind; 
that is to say, every number may be regarded as the quotient arising 
2 13 



14 ELEMENTS OP ALGEBRA. 

from dividing one quantity by another of the same kind, independently 
of tlie species to which they belong. 

Thus, the number 12 may express the abstract relation between 12 
inches and 1 inch, or between 12 months and 1 month; and may, there- 
fore, represent the quotient arising from the division of the foot by the 
inch, or the year by the month. And so it may express the quotient 
between any two quantities whatever, provided they are of the same 
kind. 

4. Mathematics is the science of quantity. 

Arithmetic is that branch of mathematics in which the quantities 
considered are represented by numbers. 

5. The word Algebra is of Arabic origin, and signifies to consolidate. 

Algebra enables us to investigate arithmetical principles in a consoli- 
dated, and, at the same time, general manner, and may be regarded as 
a compendious, and also universal arithmetic. 

6. The quantities considered in Algebra are represented by numbers 
and letters, and the operations to be performed are indicated by signs. 
The numbers, letters, and signs are generally called symbols. 

The numbers and letters that represent quantities are, for conve- 
nience, most usually called quantities themselves. The student, how- 
ever, should remember that they are only the representatives of 
quantities. 

7. The sign + is called plus, i. e., more, and when prefixed to a 
quantity, signifies that it is to be added to some other quantity expressed 
or understood. Thus, a + 6 is read a plus h, and signifies that h is to 
be added to a. The expression + c signifies that c is to be added to 
some quantity not expressed. When no sign is written before a quan- 
tity, the sign -f is always understood. In the expression a -f &, a is 
understood to be afiiected with the plus sign. 

8. A horizontal line, thus, — is called minus, i. e. less, and when 
prefixed to a quantity, signifies that it is to be substracted from some 
other quantity, expressed or understood. 

Thus, a — 6 is read a minus h, and signifies that h is to be taken 
from a. The expression — c signifies that c is to be taken from some 
quantity not expressed. 

9. A Greek cross x is called the sign of multiplication, and when 
placed between quantities, indicates that they are to be multiplied 
together. Thus, a X h is read a multiplied by h, or simply a into h, 
the sign indicating a multiplication to be performed. 



ELEMENTS OE ALaEBRA. 15 

10 The multiplication of quantities is sometimes indicated by a 
point. Thus, a . h indicates that a and h are to be multiplied 
together. 

11. The multiplication of literal factors is usually indicated by wri- 
ting them one after another, thu^ a i c is the same as a X 6 X c. This 
notation cannot be employed when numbers are used, for the product 
thus expressed would be confounded with some other number. The 
multiplication of 2 by 4, for instance, cannot be indicated by writing 
the one after the other, because the product would be mistaken for 42 
or 24. 

12. When several terms connected by the sign +, or — , arc to be 
multiplied by a single term, the multiplication is indicated by means 
of parentheses. Thus, (a -\- h -{■ c) m, signifies that the sum of a, b, 
and c is to be multiplied by m. "When the multiplier itself is composed 
of more than one term, it is also enclosed in parenthesis: Thus, (a + b) 
(m — c) indicates that the sum of a and b is to be multiplied by the 
diflFerence of m and c. A horizontal or vertical line is also used to col- 
lect terms for multiplication. Thus, a x to + « -f c, indicates that the 
sum of m, n, and c is to be multiplied by a. The same thing may be 
indicated by a vertical bar, thus 

4-TO I 

+ n 
+ c 

13. The coefficient of a quantity is a number or letter prefixed to a 
quantity, showing how often it has been added to itself. Thus, instead 
of writing a + a -r a, which denotes the addition of a three times, we 
abridge the notation by writing 3a. So also, 10.ry, signifies the 
addition of xj/ ten times. In like manner, mx signifies the addition 
of X, m times. The coefficient serves as a brief mode of indicating the 
addition of a quantity to itself. When no coefficient is written, 1 is 
always to be understood. 

14. The exponent is a small number or letter written a little above 
and to the right of a number or letter, and indicates the number of 
times it enters into itself as a factor. Thus, we write 

a^ instead of aa, and call the result a square. 

a^ " " aaa, " " " " a cube. 

a* " " aaaa, " " " " a to the fourth power. 

The exponent enables us to abbreviate the manner of indicating the 



16 ELEMENTS OF ALGEBRA. 

multiplication of a quantity by itself. When no exponent is wiitten, 1 
is always to be understood. 

Division is denoted by three signs. The division of a by & may be 

indicated hj a-i-h, or — , or a\b. 

15. The sign = is called the sign of equality, and is read " equal 
to." When placed between two quantities, it indicates that they are 
equal to each other. Thus, a = b, is read a equal to b. In like man- 
ner, 2 + 4 = 6 is read 2 plus 4 equal to 6. 

16. The sign ^ is called the sign of inequality, and is read "greater 
than," when the opening is toward the left; and "less than," when 
opening is toward the right. Thus, a ^ Z> is read, a greater than b ; 
and c <^ m is read, c less than m. 

17. A root of a quantity is a quantity which, multiplied by itself a 
certain number of times, will produce the given quantity. To indicate 
the extraction of a root, we use the sign V , called the radical sign, 
placing a number or letter to the left and over the sign to indicate what 
root is to be extracted. Thus, ^'a denotes the square root of a; 
%/~a the cube root of a ; V~a the i\>'^ root of a. 

18. The number or letter placed over the radical sign is called the 
index of the radical. When no index is written, we always understand 
that the square root is to be extracted. Thus, s/ a means that the 
square root of a is to be taken. 

19. A simple quantity is one in which the letters and numbers of 
which it is composed are not connected by the sign plus or minus. 

Thus, a, aZ>, — and c are simple quantities or monomials. All quan- 
tities not simple are compound, and called binomials when composed 
of two terms; trinomials when composed of three; and polynomials 
when composed of more than three. Each of the literal factors which 
enter into a term is called a dimension of the term. The degree of a 
term is the number of its dimensions. When a factor enters more than 
once, its dimension is denoted by the exponent. Thus, a^ is of the 
second dimension. 

20. When several factors are multiplied together, the sum of the 
exponents denotes the dimension of the term. Thus, ab is of the 
second dimension, af-bc, of the fourth, aWcd, of the sixth, &c. If 
the term is a fraction, its degree is denoted by the difference between 



ELEMENTS OF ALGEBRA. 17 

the sums of the exponents of the numerator and denominator. Thus 
is of the second degree, — ~ of the first degree, &c. 

21. A monomial is said to be liomogcneoxis, ^hen all of its literal 
factors are of the same dimension. A polynomial is said to be homo- 
geneous, when all its terms arc of the same degree. Thus ah, a?h^, 
a!^L^, are each separately homogeneous monomials ; 4a*Z/ -f 2Z/V — m^, is 
a homogeneous polynomial. 

22. Like quantities are those which are composed of the same letters, 
and which have their corresponding letters affected with the same ex- 
ponents ; SaP + lOah^ — 3a6^ are like quantities. But Sai- -f lOah 
— Sa^b'^ are unlike ; for, though the letters are like, the exponents of 
these letters are different. p. 17. 

23. The reciprocal of a quantity is 1 divided by that quantity. The 

.1 1 2 13 

reciprocal of 2 is -- ; of a, - ; of r ■ o o^ o> •-'*^'^- 
2 a 3 2 2 

3 

24. Quantities, affected with the plus i?ign, are called iwsitive quanti- 
ties, and those affected with the minus sign, are called ncfjative quan- 
tities. The student, however, should bear in mind that quantities can- 
not be positive or negative in themselves, and that by these phrases, we 
wish merely to signify additive and subtractivc quantities. 

25. To familiarize the student with the foregoing symbols, we sub- 
join a few examples fur practice : — 

1. Express in algebraic language that twice the product of x into y, 
divided by t^iree times the product of z into to, shall be equal to G. 

2. Express that the sum of a and b, when added to their difference 
is equal to twice the greater quantity a. 

3. That one-third of a quantity ??i, multiplied by ith of a second 
quantity ?), and that product increased by 100, the result will be a hun- 
dred thousand. 

4. Find the value of this expression, , when b = G-i:, f = 144, 

m.n 

m=10, n=l. 

Find the value of the expression (x a), when m = 4, ?i = 3, 

x = 2, a = l. 

Find the value of the expression —,-, when 7?i = 4, n = S, c:^=6, 

nrii 
h = 10, 1 = 100.

18 ADDITION. 

ADDITION. 

26. Addition is the connecting of several terms together by the 
sign plus or minus, so that they nuiy be reduced into a single expres- 
sion. 

There are three distinct cases : — 

CASE I. 

27. When the terms are like and have like signs. 



Add the coefficients of the several terms together, prefix the common 
sign to this sum, and write after it the common letter or letters, with 
their primitive exponents. 

Thus, + 2a + 3a are like quantities referred to the same unit, and 
may therefore be added, just as two whole numbers are added in Arith- 
metic. The -1- 2a indicates that a is to be added twice to some quan- 
tity not expressed, and + 3a that a is again to be added three times to 
the same quantity. This addition can obviously be indicated at once 
by writing + 5a instead of + 2a 4- 3a. Suppose, for example, that a 
represented one dollar, then 2a would represent two dollars, and 3a 
three dollars, and the sum, five dollars, would, of course, be represented 
by 5a. In like manner, — 36 — 46 is equal to — 76, because the minus 
signs indicate that the quantities represented by 36 and 46 are to be 
taken from some quantity not expressed, and subtracting 76 at once is 
obviously the same as first subtracting 36 and then subtracting 46. We 
may then write — 36 — 46 = — 76, the minus sign before the 76 indi- 
cating that it is to be taken from some quantity not expressed, and the 
whole expression denoting that the subtraction of 76 is the same as the 
successive subtraction of 36 and 46. This will be made plainer to the 
beginner by attributing to 6 some known value, as a pound or an ounce.

CASE II. 

28, When the quantities are like, but affected with unlike signs. 

RULE. 

Add the quantities affected tcith the positive siyn hy the last ride, then 
add those affected with the negative sign in like manner. Subtract the 
smaller of the coefficients of those sums from the greater, annex the 
common letter or letters to the difference, and prefix the sign of the 
greater sum. 

If we were required to add -{- ba — 60 + 4a — a together, we could, 
for the reasons already given, write + 9a for the positive terms, and 7a 
for the negative terms. By this, we must understand that 9a has to be 
added to some quantity not expressed, and that 7a has to be subtracted 
from the sum of 9a, and this unexpressed quantity. Now to take 7a 
from 9a, and add the remainder to the unexpressed quantity is plainly 
the same as taking 7a from the sum of 9a, and the unexpressed quan- 
tity. But the difference between 9a and 7a is 2a, hence the sum of 
-f 5a — 6a + 4a — a is + 2a. The plus 2a denotes that 2a has to 
be added to an unexpressed quantity. 

If we were required to add — 5a + Ga — 4a -f- a together, we could, 
as has been shown, collect the negative terms into a single term, — 9o, 
and the positive terms into a single term -|-7a. Wc would then be 
required to take 9a from the sum of 7a and some unexpressed quantity, 
or, which would be the same thing, to take 9a from 7a, and add the 
remainder to the unexpressed quantity. But 9a is made up of 7a 
added to 2a, and when, therefore, we subtract 9a from 7a, the 7a's 
will strike each other out, and there will still remain 2a to be sub- 
tracted. The required and unexecuted subtraction is indicated by the 
minus sign before the 2a, and the true sum of — 5a -f 6a — 4a -f a 
is therefore — 2a.

CASE III. 

29. When the quantities arc similar and dissimilar, and have like 
and unlike signs. 

RULE. 

Add all (he sets of similar terms hy the. last two rules, and write 
their sums one after another, and connect with them all the single terms 
with their oion signs. 

Since the letters are always the representatives of quantities, it is 
obvious that the quantities represented by dissimilar terms cannot be 
added into one sum. Thus, 4a + 46 neither make 8a nor 86. The 
quantity a might represent a year, and the quantity h a pound ; then 
4a would represent 4 years, and Ah would represent 4 pounds, and the 
addition ought neither to give 8 years nor 8 pounds. Hence, we can 
only reduce the similar terms in sets, and connect the results with their 
appropriate signs.

30. It often facilitates an algebraic operation to arrange the terms in 
a certain order. In addition, this arrangement is effected by placing 
all the like terms beneath one another. 

Ta^ 4 Qxy + 5^ + Aw la" + Aw + Qxy + bz 

w -\-Az + 8a-y+ 12a^ may be written 12a- + ?r + 'ixy + Az

llda'+10w + 2nxy + Viz 

31. Sometimes the addition of a compound quantity to a single quan- 
tity, or to another compound quantity, is not actually performed, but 
indicated by the parenthesis (), or vinculum. Thus, 46 + (6 — c), or 
4t ^ Ij — c, indicate that h — c is to be added to Ah. 



SUBTRACTION. 21 



Remarks. 

32. It will be noticed tliat the term addition in Algebra, is used in 
an extended sense, the operation being often arithmetical substraction. 
The addition of a negative quantity is, in fact, the same as the subtrac- 
tion of the same quantity regarded as positive. The use of negative 
quantities in Algebra constitutes one of its marked drfiferences from 
Arithmetic, in which the numbers employed are always supposed to be 
positive. By reference to the examples, another remarkable distinction 
between Algebra and Arithmetic will be observed ; each sum indicates 
Avhat (|uantities were added together, whilst an arithmetical sura con- 
tains no trace of the numbers employed. Thus, the sum of 10 and 5 
is 15, but the result does not point out the numbers that were added, 
for 15 might proceed from the addition of 14 and 1, 12 and o, 13 
and 2, &c. 

It will be seen hereafter, that in all algebraical operations, the 
result contains some, if not all, the quantities employed in the inves- 
tij^atious. 



SUBTRACTION. 

33. Subtraction is taking the dlfR'rence between two or more 
quantities, and may be regarded as the undoing of a previous addition. 

If we were required to subtract + G — 4, or 2 from 12, the result 
plainly ought to be 10. But if we write G — 4 beneath the 12, and 
perform the subtraction of each term separately, the subtraction of 6 
from 12 will give a remainder G, which is too small by 4, because we 
were not re^juired to take 6, but 2 from 12. We can only correct the 
error by adding + 4, and, hence, we have 12 — ( + G — 4) = 12 — 
G 4- 4 = 10, as before. We observe, in the last result, that the signs 
of G and 4 have both been changed. 

Again, let it be required to subtract + i — c from a. The sub- 
traction of h from a will be indicated by writing a — h, but tliis re- 
mainder is too small by c, because we were not required to subtract h 
itself from a, but what remained of h after it was reduced by c. The 
error can only be corrected by adding plus -: to the result. Hence, 
a — (+Z> — c)= a — 6 + c. 



SUBTRACTION, 



In this general example, we see that all the signs of the subtrahend 
have been changed, and then, it has been added, as in addition. 
Hence, we have the following 



RULE. 



Conceive the signs of all the terms of the subtrahend to he changed, 
and then add up these terms as in addition.

34. The remainder added to the subtrahend ought to be equal to the 
minuend, and the result, therefore, can be verified, as in Arithmetic. 

It will be seen that an Algebraic subtraction does not necessarily im- 
ply diminution, and that the remainder may not only exceed the sub- 
trahend and minuend separately, but may be equal to their arithmetical 
sum. In general, the subtraction of a negative quantity is equivalent 
to the addition of the same quantity taken positively. Thus, — 6 taken 
from a gives a + 6 for a remainder. This subject may be illustrated 
by a simple example : Suppose a to represent the value of an estate 
exclusive of its liabilities, and 6 a mortgage upon that estate, then a — b 



SUBTRACTION. 23 

will represent the actual value of the estate. Now, suppose some friend 
of the owner should determine to cancel his debt ; he could do this, 
either by removing the mortgage (in algebraical language, taking away 
— h), or by giving him a sum of money equal to the debt, that is, 
a sum represented by + h. So we see that, taking a-^vay — 6 is equi- 
valent to adding -f- h. 

35. Quantities arc considered negative, when opposed in character or 
direction to other quantities of the same kind, that are assumed to be 
positive. 

Thus, if a ship leave port with the intention of sailing due north, but 
encounters adverse winds, and is driven south part of the time; to get 
the distance passed over .north, we must obviously subtract the distance 
sailed over south. If then the direction north be considered positive, 
the direction south must be considered negative. Suppose the vessel 
sails first day 100 miles north to 10 south, second day 80 miles north 
and 30 south, the entire distance passed over in a northern direction 
will be expressed by 100 + 80 — 10 — 30 = 140. 

If a man agree to labor for a dollar per day, and to forfeit half a dollar 
for every idle day, and he labor 4 days and is idle 2, his wages will be 
4x 1 — 2x J, or4x l + 2( — *) = 3. We see that we have re- 
garded as negative, cither the forfeiture as opposed to gain, or the idle 
days as opposed to the working days. 

If a man's age be now thirty j-ears, his age four years hence will be 
expressed by 30 + 4 ; his age four years ago by 30 — 4. Here future 
time being positive, past time is negative. If a steamboat sail with a 
velocity of 10 miles per hour, and encounter a head wind that would 
carry it back at the rate of 8 miles per hour, then its rate of advance 
will be expressed by 10 — 8, or 2 miles per hour. But if it be carried 
back at the rate of 12 miles per hour, then its rate of advance will be 
expressed by 10 — 12, or — 2 miles per hour. It will then plainly be 
carried back, and the minus indicates a change of direction. 

Distance, when estimated as positive in one direction, is considered nega- 
tive in the opposite direction. Thus, let the distance AB = n and BC = w, 

C 

'- i , the distance BC being considered positive on the 

A B ' ' ° ^ 

right of B. Then AC ^ wi + n. Now suppose the distance BC be esti- 
mated on the left of B, the point C falling between B and A, then 
AC = m — n. We see that the distance BC, which was regarded as 
positive on the right of B, became negative when estimated on the left. 



24 MULTIPLICATION. 

In general, the minus sign may be regarded as always indicating 
either that a quantity has changed its character or direction, or that it 
is just the opposite of something else of the same kind that is con- 
sidered positive. 



MULTIPLICATION. 

36. Multiplication is a short method of adding the multiplicand 
to itself as many times as there are units in the multiplier. Thus, to 
multiply a by Z) is to add a to itself h times, and since the addition of 
a to itself twice is 2a, three times 3a, &c., the addition of a to itself h 
times will be ha. Hence the product of a by & will be la or ah, for it 
plainly matters not in what order we write the factors. 

There are three cases : — 



CASE I. 

37. When both multiplicand and multiplier are simple quantities. 

Before giving a rule for the multiplication, it will be necessary to 
show that the product of simple quantities having like signs, both plus 
or both minus, is always positive, and that the product is always nega- 
tive when they have unlike signs. The product of + a by -{-h is 
plainly + ah, because plus a added to itself h times m.ust, of course, be 
positive. 

And — a by -\- h must be negative, because — a added to itself any 
number of times must, of course, retain its sign. But — a by — h 
will give + ah, for the h having a minus sign before it, indicates the 
reverse of what it did before, and therefore denotes that — a is to be 
subtracted from itself h times. But we have seen that the subtraction 
of — a is the same as the addition of H- a ; in like manner, the subtrac- 
tion of — a twice is the same as the addition of + 2o ; the subtraction 
of — a tliroe times the same as the addition of + 3a ; and the subtraction 
of — a, h times, the same as the addition of + a, + h times, or + ah. 
Hence, the product — o by — & is + ah, and we see that like signs 
produce plus, and unlike signs, minus. 

Let it now be required to multiply a^ by a". The exponents indicate 
that a enters twice as a factor in a^, and four times as a factor in a, 
hence, it will enter 6 times as a factor in the result. 



MULTIPLICATION. 25 

Hence, a^ x a'' := aaaaaa = a^, and we see that the multiplication is 
effected by adding the exponents of the same letter. 

To multiply a^ by ab is the same as multiplying a^ by a, and then 
multiplying the result by h. But to multiply a^ by a, we have only to 
add the exponents of a^ and a, hence the result is a'. Now multiply 
by b, and we have a'^b. 

The multiplication is effected by adding the exponents of like letters, 
and writing after the result the letter which is not common to the mul- 
tiplicand and multiplier, with its primitive exponent. In like manner 
a^ X ah^ will be a^b^. To multiply a\- by ab, is the same as multiplying 
a^c by a, and then the result by b. But a'^c by a, as we have seen, gives 
a^c, and that product by b, will plainly be a\b. And the multiplica- 
tion is again effected by adding the exponents of like letters, and writing 
after the result the letters, which are not common, affected with their 
primitive exponents. The same reasoning can be extended to any num- 
ber of factors, the multiplication being effected in every instance, by 
adding the exponents of like letters, and writing after the result, the 
letters not common, with their primitive exponents. Thus, a^cd by ab 
gives aW6, and ah-d by abm gives a\dbni. We have taken mono- 
mials whose coefficients were unity. If we were required to multiply 
a by 2b, the product of a by 6 has to be nuiltiplied by 2, but the pro- 
duct a by 6 is ab, hence the result is 2ab. If we were required to 
multiply 2a by b, then 2a has to be added to itself as many times as 
there are units in b, but to add 2a to itself twice gives 2a x 2 or 4a, 
to add it three times gives 2a X 3, or Ga, and to add it b times gives 
2a X b, or 2ab. In like manner, if we were required to multiply 2rt 
by 4i, then 2a has to be added to itself -ib times, and the result will 
plainly be 2a x 46, or Sab : the same result that we would get by 
multiplying the literal factors together, and prefixing the product of 
the coefficient for a new coefficient. Hence we have for the multipli- 
cation of monomials, the following 

RULE. 

38. Multqjlr/ tJie coefficients to<jctlicr for a neio coefficient, and write 
after it, all the literal factors, common to the tico monomials, affected 
with exponents equal to the sum of the exponents in the multiplicand 
and midtipUer, and those, ichich are not common, with their primitive 
exponents. If the monomials have like signs, give the phis sign to the 
product ; if they have xmlike signs, give the minus sign to the j^roduct.

Remnrlcs. 

39. We see, from the last four examples, that we can make any 
change in the position of the exponents, provided we retain the factors, 
and get the same result. 

We see, from examples 13, 14, and 15, that when the factors of the 
multiplicand and multiplier are homogeneous, the factors of the result 
will also be homogeneous. 

Example 11 shows that this will not be true when the multiplicand is 
alone made up of homogeneous factors ; and Example 1 shows that it 
will not be true when the multiplier alone is homogeneous. 

40. Any number of monomials may be multiplied together, in accord- 
ance with the preceding principles.

We see, that when the monomials are all positive, the result will be 
positive ; and when the negative monomials are even in number, the 
result will also be positive. But when an odd number of negative mo- 
nomials are multiplied together, as in the fourth Example, or when an 
odd number of negative monomials are multiplied by a positive mono- 
mial, as in Example 3, the result will be negative. The result would 
also be negative, if an odd number of negative monomial factors was 
multiplied into any number of positive monomial factors. 



CASE II. 

41. When tlae multiplicand is a compound quantity and the multi- 
plier a monomial. 

The multiplicand is to be repeated as many times as there are 
units in the multiplier; each term of the multiplicand is then to be 
multiplied by the multiplier, and the partial products to be connected 
with their appropriate signs. We might a.ssumc, what has already 
been proved for monomials, that the product of a positive quantity by a 
positive, or of a negative quantity by a negative, gives a positive result; 
and that the product of a positive quantity by a negative gives a nega- 
tive i-esult. But we can demonstrate this rule more rigorously : Let it 
be required to multiply a — a hy + c. We know that a — a is zero, 
and that zero repeated c times must still be zero. Hence, the product 
of a — a by + c must be zero. But + ahy + c gives -|- ac for a 
product, and, therefore, the product of — a by -|- c must be — ac, in 
order to cancel the first product. Hence, the product of a negative 
quantity by a positive gives a negative result. Or, to express the 
whole algebraically, 

a — a = 

+ c 

■j-ac — ac = o 



28 M U Ti T I P L I C A T I N . 

Let it now be re((uired to multiply a — a by — c. The multipli- 
cand being zero, tlie product must be zero. But, from wliat has just 
been shown, the product of + a and — c is — ac, hence, the product 
of — a by — c must be + ac, to destroy the first product. Or, in 
other words, the product of a negative quantity by a negative must be 
effected with the positive sign. 

Algebraically, a — a = o 
— c 



We conclude that the product of a positive quantity by a positive, and 
of a negative quantity by a negative, is positive ; and that the product 
of a positive quantity by a negative is negative. Briefly, we say like 
signs give a positive result, and unlike, a negative result.

MULTIPLICATION. 29 



CASE III. 

42. When tlie multiplicand and multiplier are both compound quan- 
tities. 

The multiplicand, as in the two preceding cases, is to be repeated as 
many times as there are units in the multiplier. The multiplicand and 
multiplier will, in genei*al, be made up of some positive and some ncg:'- 
tive terms. Let a denote the sum of all the positive terms in the mul- 
tiplicand, and b the sum of all the negative terms. Let c denote the 
sum of the positive terms in the multiplier, and d the sum of all th(> 
negative terms. We write the multiplier beneath the multiplicand 
and multiply all the terms of the one by all the terms of the other. 

Thus, 



a 
c 


— b 

— d 


ac 


— be 

— ad + bd 



ac — be — ad -f- bd. 

To explain this result, let us drop fur a moment the consideration of 

— d, then a — b must be repeated e times. From what has been 
shown, the result of this multiplication will be ac — be. But we were 
not required to multiply a — i by c alone, but by c after it had been 
diminished by d ; hence, the result, ac — be, is too great by a — b 
taken d times. To correct the error, then, we must subtract the pro- 
duet of a — bhj d from the first product ac — be. The product of 
a — b by -f d, from what has been shown, will be + ad — bd, and 
to indicate that this must be subtracted, we write it in parenthesis with 
the minus sign before it. The whole result will be oc — be — (-f ad 

— bd) = ac — be — ad + bd, since the signs of the quantities sub- 
tracted must be changed. By examining the result, we will observe, as 
before, that the product of quantities affected with like signs is positive, 
and that of quantities affected with unlike signs is minus. 

43. It is found most convenient to arrange both polynomials with 
reference to the highest or lowest exponent of the same letter. Thus, 
x^ -{- x^ + X -\- a is arranged with reference to the highest exponent 
of X ; and a + x + x^ + x^ is arranged with reference to the lowest 
exponent of the same letter. In these expressions, x is supposed to 
enter to the zero power in the term a, as will be explained under the 
head of Division.

45. It will be observed in the above examples, that by arranging 
with reference to a certain letter, and by removing each result one 
place further to the right than the preceding, the terms which reduce 
fall immediately the one below the other. And it is to save the trouble 
of looking for the terms which reduce, that this arrangement and sys- 
tem are made. It will also be noticed that in every product there are 
two terms which do not reduce with other terms, viz., those which 
result from the multiplication of the quantities affected with the highest 
and lowest exponents of the arranged letter. 

In the first example, x^ and — a^ are the irreducible terms, in the 
second, x? and ay.

MULTIPLICATION. 



RemarJis. 



46. It -will be seen, by inspecting tlie above results, that when the 
two polynomials are both homogeneous, the product is also homoge- 
neous, and of a degree equal to the sum of the dimensions of the mul- 
tiplicand and multiplier. Thus, in Example 7th, the first polynomial 
is homogeneous, and of the first degree ; and the second is also homo- 
geneous of the first degree, the product is homogeneous of the second 
degree. In Example 8th, the multiplier is homogeneous of the second 
degree, and the multiplier is homogeneous of the first degree; the product 
is homogeneous of the third degree. The same may be noticed in 
several other examples. 

2d. We notice also that when the coefl&cients are the same in each 
term of the multiplicand, and the same in each term of the multiplier, 
and all the terms of both polynomials are positive, that the sum of the 
coefiicients in the product will be equal to the product arising from mul- 
tiplying the sum of the coefiScients in one polynomial by the sum of the 
coefiicients in the other. Thus, in Example 16, each coefficient of the 
multiplicand is 1. and each coefficient of the multiplier 7. The sum of 
•the coefficients of the multiplicand is 3, and that of the multiplier 14 : 
the sum of the coefficients in the product is 3 X 14 = 42. The same 
law may be noticed in Examples 15, 18, and 22. 

47. Examples 10 and 19 show. that when the multiplicand is com- 
posed of the diff"erence of two terms, whose coefficients are equal, the 
algebraic sum of the coefficients in the product is zero. Examples 7 
and 21 show that this sum is also zero when the multiplier is composed 
of two terms with contrary signs and equal coefficients. 

3d. It has already been remarked that there are always two terms, 
which do not reduce with any other terms. We can only reduce similar 
terms, and when the two polynomials have been arranged with respect 
to a certain letter, the products of the extreme terms are dissimilar to 
the other partial products. The whole process of division of polynomials 
is based upon this fact, and it ought to be remembered. By attending 
to the above laws in regard to the product, we can often by a simple 
inspection detect errors in the multiplication. 

There are three theorems of great importance, which must be com- 
mitted to memory. 



MULTIPLICATION. 33 



Theorem I. 



48. The square of the sum of two quantities is equal to the square 
of the first, plus the double product of the first by the second, plus the 
square of the second. 

Let X denote the firi<t <[uanlity, and a the second, then .r + a = sum 
and {x + «)^=(x 4- a) (.c + a), which, by performing the multiplica- 
tion, will be found equal to x^ + lax + a^. 

Hence (x + iif^=x^ + lax + a^, as enunciated. 

So (10 + 5/ = 10^ + 20 X 5 + 5^ = 100 + 100 + 25 = 225. 

And (40 + 6/ = 40^ + 80 X 6 + G^ = 1600 + 480 + 36 = 2116. 

In like manner (x"" + a"/ = x^"" + 2x'"a'" + a^"". 

The rule may be extended to binomials of any form. 

Thus, (3a + hj = (3a)^ + 6a/j -\- V = Oa^ + 6«& + i'- 

(7x + ^yf = (7x)=+ 14x ibij) + {hyf = 49x^ + lOxy + 25f. 

A polynomial may be squared by the same formula. 

Let it be required to square x + a + i/. 

Make X + a = z. 

Then X + a + jy = r:+7/ and (x -f a + yf = (^ + yf = :? + 2.ry 

+r- 

Now substitute for z its value x -\- a, and we have (x + a + yf = 
(^ +af+2 (x +a)y + f = x'+ 2ax + x' + 2x>/ + 2ay + //. 

Required the square of 2^ -f x + «t + n. 

Let 2}/ -{- x = z, and m + '* = s. 

Then (2y + x + m + nf = (z + sf = z' + 2zs + s' = (2y + xf 
+ 2 (2>/ + X) (m + n) + (m + nf == 4/ + 4yx + x' + 4>/m + iyn 
-f 2xm + 2.rn + ni^ + 2»i/( + n\ 

Required the square of oy + 4x + m + 2n-f 5. 

Represent the first three terms by a single letter, and the last two 
also by a single letter, and proceed as before. 

TlIEOHEM II. 

49. The square of the diiTorcnce of two quantities is equal to the 
square of the first, minus the double product of the first by the second, 
plus the square of the second. 

Let X and a denote the quantities, then x — o = difference. 
And (x — a)^ = (x — a) (x — a) = x^ — 2ax + a^, as enunciated, 
So(10 — 5)^ = 10^— 20x 5+ (5)2=^100 — 100 + 25 = 25. 
And(40 — 6)^ = (40)^ — 80 X 6 + 6^ = 1600—480 + 36 = 1156.

+ aK 
llequircd square of a;^ — a^. Ans. x^ — 2x^a? + a^. 



Theorem III. 

50. The sum of two quantities multiplied by the difference of the 
same quantities, is equal to the difference of their squares. 

Let X and a denote their quantities. 

Then x -{• a= sum, and x — a = difference, and (.« + o) {x — a) 
== x^ — a^, by performing the multiplication indicated. 
So (10 + 5) (10 — 5) = (10/ — (5)^ = 100 — 25 == 75. 
And (40 + 6) (40 — 6) = (40)'' — (6)* = 1600 — 36 = 1564. 
Multiply (4« + 6) by (4a — 6). Ans. 16a^ — 6^ 

Multiply la + /j + f by 7a + 6 — c. 

Ans. (7a + ly — c' = 49a2 + Uab + J/ — c\ 
Multiply x -\- y + z + m\)j .K -\- y + z — m. 

Ans. (,x +1J + zj — m'' = x' + f+ z" + 2xy + 2xz + 2ijz — m". 
Multiply X -\- y ^r z -{- m\)^ X ■\- y — z — m. 

Ans. {x + yf — {z + mj- = a-^ -f 2xy -\- y'^ — ^^ — 2mz — m'- 
■V 

Remarks. 

51. If we omit the exponents of the extreme terms in the expres- 
sion, x^ + 2«x + a^, and connect these terms with the exponents so 
omitted, by the sign of the middle term 2oa-, we have a; + a, the bino- 
mial, which squared gave x? -f 2aa; + a^- In like manner, if we omit 
the exponents of x^ and o^ in the expression, a? — 2aa; -f o?, and con- 
nect them with their exponents omitted by the sign of the middle term, 
we have x — a, the binomial, which squared gave a;** — 2ax + a;l 

In like manner, if we have given the difference of two squares, we 
can readily determine the quantities which, by being multiplied together, 
gave this difference. 

Thus n^ — ?j^ = (m + n) (m — ?i), and r- — .s^-:= (r + s) (r — s). 

Omit the exponents, connect the terms by the sign plus, and we have 
the sum of the two quantities ; omit and connect by the .sign minus, and 




FACTORING POLYNOMIALS. 

WO have the difference. And the product of the sum by the difference, 
is the difference of the squares. These remai-ks are preliminary to an 
important subject. 

FACTORING POLYXOMIALS. 

52. It is often a matter of great importance to resolve a polynomial 
into its factors. The reduction of expressions can often be effected in 
this way, and in no other. Practice alone can make the student expert 
in the resolution of an algebraic expression into its factors. A few rules 
may, however, assist the beginner. 

53. 1st. Look out for the terms which have a commoa factor, and 
write them- in parenthesis, as a multiplier of that factor j next look for 
another set of terms also having a common factor, and write them in 
like manner; proceed thus until all the terms are taken up. Observe 
whether the parenthetical expressions are the same, if so, multiply the 
common parenthesis into the ahjchraic sum of the terms to which it 
serves as a coefficient. 



1. hx + ha->r CX + ca = h (./- + a) + c (.c + o) = (x + a) {h + c). 

2. hx + ha — cx — ca = h{x -\- a) + (x^ a) (— c) = (x + a) {h 
-c). 

3. — hx — ha -f ex + ca = (— h) (.r + a) + (.c + a) c = (x + a) (r 

4. hx + ex -\- ha + dx + da -f ca = (.c -{. a)h -{■ (x -\- a) c-\- (^x-'r a) 
d = (x+a) (h+c-ird). 

5. hx-\- ex -\- ha — dx — d(t -f- ca = (x + o) (h -\- c — d). 

6. a^ +ax + hx-{- ah = {x + a) x +(x- -{-a')h = (x+ a) (x + 6). 

7. x^ — ax -{■ hx — ah = (x — «) (x + />). 

8. x^ — ax + hx — ah + x^ — ax' = (x — a)(x+h + x"). 

9. x^ — ax + hx — ah -f mx^ — ajnx^ = (x — o) (x + h + mx^). 
10. x^ — ax + ix — cd) + amx^ — mx^ = (x — a)(x -\- h — mx^). 

54. 2d. After having found a common factor or parenthesis, see 
whether that factor may not admit of farther reduction. (Articles 48, 
49, and 50.)

5. «=> + 2n' + 7i = n (n + \)\

12. m^ — n' — 2c7i — c^ = m^ — (h + cf. 

We have now the differences of two squares, and to apply the formula 

x" — a^ = (x + a) (x- — a). (Art. 50). 

We see that m^ = .r^, or on = .r, and (n + cf = ry^, or w + c = a. 
Hence (x -\- a) = {m + ?i + c), and (.r — ff) = hn — n — c). 
Therefore m^ — (?i + cf = (vu + n + c) (?n — n — c). 

13. m^ — 11^ + 2cn. — c^ = Hi^ — (n — cf = (m + n — c) (in + c 
— ??). In this Example m = x, and n — c = a. 

14. m- + 2Z;??i + b^— n"" — 2cn ^ n" = (m + bf — (n + cf = (m 
+ b + n -\- c) X (m + b — n — c). 

55. 3d. Expressions may sometimes be thrown into factors by an 
artifice, when they do not at first glance appear to admit of resolution 
into factors. One of the simplest contrivances to effect a decomposition 
into factors is the addition to, and subtraction of the same quantity 
from the given expression, which operation docs not, of course, alter its 
value. 

EXAMPLES. 

1. x^^2x — l'i = x- — 2x + 1 — 15— l = a;^ — 2a: -r 1 — 16

In this example, the decomposition was effected by adding + 1, and 
subtracting the same from the given expression. The first three terms

DIVISION. 

56. Division consists iu finding how many times one quantity is 
contained in another. 

The quantity divided is called the dividend, that by which it is 
divided, the divisor, and the result obtained the quotient. 

57. It follows from this that the quotient multiplied by the divisor 
must give the dividend. 

The quotient is said to be exact when the dividend contains the 
divisor an exact number of times. When this is not so, the quotient is 
called imperfect. 

It will be seen that the object of division is to find a quantity called 
the quotient, which, when multiplied by the divisor, will give the 
dividend. 

The result of the division of 4rtx by 2a is plainly 2x, because 2a X 
2a; = 4aa", the dividend. 

So, ■ — - = la, because 7a X ac = 7a^<:. 
ac 

But — ; — — gives — 1x for a quotient, because 2a X ( — 2x) = — 4ax. 

i , — 7a^c ^ . ^ „ 2 

And = — ia, because — i a x ac = — ia'^c. 

ac 

58. And, in general, since the quotient into the divisor must give the 
dividend ; when the sign of the quantity to be divided is unlike that by 
which it is divided, the result will be negative, and when the sign of 
the quantity to be divided is like that by which it is divided, the result 
will have the positive sign. 

Thus, J- = + a, because + a X — h = — ah. 

59. In Division, then, as in multiplication, like signs produce +, 
and unlike signs — . 

There are three cases iu Division. 



CASE I. 

Whe7i the dividend and divisor are hoth monomials. 
60. Divide a^ by a ; we are to find a quantity, which, multiplied by 
a, will give aj^. This quantity is plainly a^, because a^ X a = a^. 



DIVISION. 39 

And, since, in multiplication, we add the exponents of like letters, Ave 
must, in division, subtract the exponents of like letters. 

Divide 6a' by 2«, the result is obviously 3a^ ; because 2a X oa^ = 
Qa". And since, in multiplication, we multiply the coefficients together 
for a new coefficient, we must, in division, divide the coefficients for a 
new coefficient. 

Divide a'^b by a, the result is plainly ah, because oh X a = ci^h. 
Divide a^6V by a, the result is aiV. And, in general, if there arc 
letters in the dividend not common to the divisor, they will enter into 
the quotient with their primitive exponents. 



RULE. 

61. Divide the coefficient «f the dividend hi/ the coefficient of the 
divisor for the coefficient of the quotient. Write after this neio coeffi- 
cient all the letters common to dividend and divisor affected icith expo- 
nents equal to the excels (f the exponents of the dividend over those of 
the same letters in divisor, and icrite the letters common to the dividend 
only with their primitive exponents. Give the quotient the sijn -{■ , 
where the monomials have likf siijns, and the si(/n — , ichcre they have 
unlike signs.

40 DIVISION. 

02. It will be seen that the division of monomials is impossible when 
the coefficient of the dividend is not divisible by that of the divisor, 
and when the divisor contains one or more letters than the dividend. 

63. In such cases, the quotient appears in the form of a fraction, 
which may admit of farther reduction by striking out the common fac- 
tors. Thus, the quotient arising from the division of 7a^ by 'la^b, is 

-r— rr, because — ^r- X la^b is plainly equal to the dividend 7«^. But 
la^b Za^b 

-r-^ may be reduced to -— by striking out the common factor, a^. 
'lo?b '' 'lb ^ "^ ' 

In like manner, la^b, divided by 2«//, is -—- = -— . 

64. We will now demonstrate two principles which will enable us 
to reduce such expressions still lower. 

1st. Any quantity raised to the zero power is equal to unity, that is, 

a° = 1. For — by the rule for the exponents in division is equal to 
ara-m _ f,o^ j^j^^^ ^ny quantity divided by itself is also equal to one. 

Hence, — = a" is also equal to 1. Therefore, rt" = 1.

67. In this example, and in all similar examples, when the divisor 
contains a letter or letters not contained in the dividend, we may con- 
ceive this letter, or these letters, also to enter into dividend raised to 
the zero power, and to execute the division, we have only to subtract 
the exponents of like letters, as before. Thus, x^y may be written 
x^i/c°, and we have only to subtract 1, the exponent of c- in the divisor, 
from o, the exponent of c in the dividend. The result will be o — 1, 
or — 1. 

Divide x^y by a?b\* ; then x^y = x''ya''b°c'', and the result will be 
x'ya-'b-'c-". 

68. Strictly speaking, then, there is but one case in which the divi- 
sion of monomials will not give an entire quotient, and that is, when 
the coefficient of the dividend is not exactly divisible by the coefficient 
of the divisor. 



CASE II. 

69. When the dividend is a compound quantity, and the divisor a 
monomial. 

The dividend may be regarded as the product of each term of the 
quotient sought by the monomial divisor; hence, to find this quotient, 
we must divide each term of the dividend by the divisor.

CASE III. 

71. When the dividend and divisor are both polynomials. 

We must keep in view that the dividend is the collection, after addi- 
tion and subtraction, of the partial products arising- from multiplying each 
term of the quotient, when found, by each term of the divisor. If, then, 
we can find a true term of the quotient and multiply it into each term 
of the divisor, we will form so much of the dividend as was composed 
of the product of this term by the whole divisor. And when we have 
subtracted this product from the dividend, the remainder will be made 
up of the partial products of the remaining terms of the quotient not 
yet found by each term of the divisor. Now, if we can find another 



DIVISION. 43 

true term of the quotient and multiply it into the divisor, the product 
will be so much of the dividend as is made up by the multiplication of 
this second term of the quotient by each term of the divisor. And if 
■we subtract this product from the first remainder, the new remainder, 
if there be any, will be so much of the dividend as is made up of the 
product of the remaining terms of the quotient not yet found by 
each term of the divisor. We can thus regard each remainder in 
succession as a new dividend until all the terms of the quotient are 
found. 

72. The whole difficulty then consi.^ts in finding, in succession, true 
terras of the quotient. Now, we have seen that in the product of poly- 
nomials there are always two terms which are dissimilar from the other 
terms, and, consequently, irreducible with them. They arc the terms 
arising from the multiplication of the two terms in the multiplicand and 
multiplier affected with the highest and lowest exponent of the same 
letter. If, then, we divide that term of the dividend which contains 
the highest exponent of a certain letter by that term of the divisor 
which contains the highest exponent of the same letter, we are sure of 
getting a true term of the quotient. For this terra of the dividend has 
been formed without reduction from the multiplication of the corres- 
ponding term in the divisor by the quotient found. 

73. In like manner, if wc divide the terms afiected with the lowest 
exponent of the same letter, the one by the other, we are sure of get- 
ting a true term of the quotient sought. For this reason, the dividend 
and divisor are arranged with reference to the highest or lowest 
exponent of the same letter, generally with reference to the highest. 
AVhen so arranged, the first term of each successive remainder will con- 
tain the highest or lowest exponent of the letter according to which the 
polynomials are arranged, and will, when divided by the fir^t term of 
the divisor, give a true terui of the quotient. 

The divisor in Algebra is written on the right of the dividend, and 
the quotient imraediately under the divisor.

44 DIVISION. 

74. We see, that by arranging dividend and divisor with reference 
to the ascending or descending powers of the same letter, and dividing 
the first term of the dividend and the first of the remainder by the first 
term of the divisor, we necessarily get true terms of the quotient. But 
if the polynomials are not arranged we will not get true terms of the 
quotient. Write the dividend and divisor thus, 

Dividend. Divisor. 



V + h' h 



a 



— — &c., Quotient. 



a 

We get — for the first term of the quotient, which is not a true 

result. It is also plain that the division would never end. 

75. Since each successive remainder may be regarded as a new poly- 
nomial, to be divided by the divisor, we can change the arrangement 
of the remainders at pleasure, provided we make a corresponding change 
in the divisor. lu the example above we might arrange the remainder 
ah + h"^ with reference to h, and write it V^ + ah, provided we change 
the arrangement of the divisor, and write it 6 + a. 



^ RULE. 

76. Arrange the dividend and divisor with reference to the ascend- 
ing or descending powers of the same letter, and then divide the first 
term on the left of the dividend hy the first term on the left of the divi- 
sor. This will give the first term of the quotient. 

Multijyly this term into each term of the divisor, and suhtract the 
product from the dividend. Divide the first term of the remainder hy 
the first term of the divisor for the second term of the quotient. Multi- 
ply this term into the divisor, as hefore, and suhtract the pjruduct froin 
the first remainder. 

Continue this process, dividing the first term of each remainder hy 
the first term of the divisor until we get a remainder, zero, when the 
division is said to he exact. 

But, if the exponents of the letter, according to which the arrange- 
ment is made, are all positive, and the first term of any remainder is 



DIVISION. 45 

not divisible hy the first term of the divisor, the quotient is incomplete ; 
or, -if some of the exjwnents are nerjative, and the letter, according to 
which the arrangement has been made, has disappeared from any of 
the successive remainders, the quotient is also incomplete.

77. I. When the exponents of the arranged letter in dividend and 
divisor are all positive, the division will not be exact if the first terra 
of any of the reinaiudcrs docs not contain the arranijed letter to a higher 
power than it is contained in the divisor. "When, therefore, we got a 
remainder in which the first terra contains the arranged letter to a lower 
degree than it is contained in the divisor, we need proceed no further, 
for we can never arrive at an exact quotient. 

If some of the exponents of the letter, according to which the poly- 
nomials are arranged, are negative, the last rule will not hold good, for 
the result of the division will be a term affected with a negative expo- 
nent, and there ought to be one or more such terms in the quotient, 
[f, however, the letter, according to which the ai'rangement has been 
made, has disappeared from any of the successive remainders, we need 
proceed no further. 

II. Examples 6, 7, and 9, show that the difference between the like 

powers of two quantities is divisible by the like powers of a lower degree 

of those quantities, when the common exponent of the dividend, divided 

by the common exponent of the divisor, gives an exact quotient. And 

they show that the number of terms in the quotient is expressed by the 

quotient of the exponents. Thus, in example 6 there are four terms 

8 
in the quotient, the same as— the quotient of the exponents. In ex- 



48 DIVISION. 

ample 9, the quotient of the exponents is three, and the division is 
exact, with three terms in the result. 

III. Examples 13, 14, and 15, show that the sum of the like powers 
of two quantities is divisible by the sum of the like powers of the same 
quantities when the result of the division of the exponents is odd. 

IV. Examples 28, 29, and 30, show that the diiFerence between the 
like powers of two quantities is divisible by the sum of their like powers 
when the quotient of the exponents is even. In the last two cases, as 
in the first, the quotient of the exponents gives the nuuibor of terms in 
the result. 

V. If all the exponents of the dividend and divisor are positive, we 
can tell, by a simple inspection, in many examples, whether the divi- 
sion is possible; when the extreme terms of the arranged polynomials 
are not divisible by each other, the quotient will not be exact. Take 
^ -f ^Ixy + 'if', to be divided by ^ -^ tf ; the division is impossible, 
because the exponents of the result must be positive ; and oi^ by x* will 
give a;"'. It, of course, does not follow that the division will give a 
complete quotient when the extreme terms are divisible by each other. 
Take a;^ -f 4 + if, to be divided by .-r ■\- y ) the extreme terms are 
divisible by each other, but the quotient of the polynomials is not 
exact. 

PRINCIPLES IN DIVISION. 

78. I. We will now show that the difference between the like powers 

of two quantities will be divisible by the difference of their like powers 

of a lower degree, whenever the quotient of the common exponent of 

the dividend, by the common exponent of the divisor, is exact. That 

is, that a"' — If" is divisible by a" — ^ i", when m is exactly divisible 

by n. 

„m _ ^^m I „"— ^;". 



a'"~"h" — b"' = h" (a™ " — h"' "). 

Performing the division, we get a"'~" for a quotient, and l>" (a'"-" — 
6"—°) for a remainder. If this remainder is divisible by a" — i", the 
dividend will also be divisible by a" — l" ; for, represent the dividend 
by D, the divisor by d, the quotient by q, and the remainder by R. 
Then a" — h"", or J) = qd + B,. Now, qd is plainly divisible by d, and 
if R be also divisible by d, the first member must also be divisible by 
d, otherwise we would have the sum of two entire quantities equal to a 



DIVISION. 49 

fraction. Kence, in general, if the remainder is divisible by the divi- 
sor, the dividend will also be divisible by it. Then, if we can prove 
that the remainder, b" (a""" — b'"~°), can be divided by a" — Z>", we 
can prove that the dividend can also be divided by a' — 1°. But if the 
factor, a'"~° — i"""", is divisible by the divisor, h" times that factor will 
also be divisible by the divisor ; and the remainder giving an exact quo- 
tient, the dividend will also give an exact quotient. That is, a"" — J" 
will be divisible by a" — b" whenever a"""" — i""" is divisible by a" — 
b"; or, in other words, if the difference of the like power of two quanti- 
ties is divisible by the difference of the like power of the n*"* degree, 
the difference of the like powers of a degree higher by n will also be 
divisible by the difference of the n**" degree. But we know that a" — 
b" is divisible by itself, a° — b" ; hence, by the principle just demon- 
strated, a^° — b^" mu.st be divisible by a" — b". And since a* — i*" is 
divisible by a" — b", a^" — i"" must also be divisible by a" — b", and 
so on, for powers of a degree greater by n, until it finally reaches and 
divides a™ — b'". This power must eventually be reached, because m 
is supposed to be a multiple of n. 

79. In Example 8, x'' — y, divided by j:^ — i/', the quotient was 
not exact, because m or 7 was not a multiple of n or 2. 

In Examples 6, 7, and 9, the quotients were exact, because in each 
case m was a multiple of n. 

80. It is plain thatj^a"" — pb"" can be divided by qa" — qb" whenjj 
and m are multiples of q and n. For we can put the expressions 
under the form of p {a"' — b""), and q (a" — i°), and the quotient 
will, of course, be exact when j^ will divide q, and a" — b"' will divide 
a" — b\ 

Thus, in Example 18 we found Wx^ — 14// divisible by Ix^ — ly'^ : 
the dividend can be written, 14 (x^ — y), and the divisor 7 (.c^ — y^, 
and since 14 will divide 7, and x^ — y* will divide .'-^ — ?/^, the quo- 
tient is exact. 

81. The demonstration holds good whenever n, added to itself a cer- 
tain number of times, will produce m, and is therefore true for quanti- 
ties affected with negative and fractional exponents.

82. II. The difference of the like powers of two quantities is divisi- 
Dle by the sum of their like powers of a lower degree, when the result 
of the division of the common exponent of the dividend by the common 
exponent of the divisor is an even number; which is evident from the 
principle of Article 50. 

83. III. The sum of the like powers of two quantities is divisible 
by the sum of their like powers of a lower degree, when the quotient 
arising from dividing the common exponent of dividend by the common 
exponent of the divisor is an odd number. 

That is, «"■ + b"" is divisible by a" + V", when m, divided by rt, is 
an odd number. 

Performing the division, we will have — Z*" (a"""" — J""") for a re- 
mainder, and whenever the factor, a""" — i"*""", is divisible by a" + 6", 
the dividend a™ + b'^ will be divisible by the same divisor. But we 
have just shown that d""" — i""" can be divided by a" + Z)° when 

m — n . , in — n . m 

IS an even number, and smce is the same as 1, 

n n 71 

„ 'ni , , , . 1 . „ ???- — n . 
the quotient of — must be odd in case the quotient of is even. 

Hence, the truth of the proposition. Thus, in Examples 13, 14, and 

15, the quotients were exact, because for each of these examples — 

was an odd number. So, in like manner, x^ + a", x^ + a^, x} + a', 
&c., are divisible by a; + a, and give 3, 5, 7, &c., terms in the quo- 
tient, with signs alternately plus and minus. 

84. IV. It is plain that the sum of the like powers of two quantities 
cannot be divided by the difference of their like powers ; that is, a"' + 
i" cannot be divided by a" — Z»", because it is not possible to decom- 
pose the sum of two quantities into factors, one of which will be a dif- 
ference between the quantities.

ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 

85. A fraction is a hrohcn part of unity. The denominator denotes 
the number of equal parts into which the unit has been broken or 
divided, and the numerator expresses the number of these equal parts 
taken. Thus, the fraction f indicates that the unit has been divided 
into three equal parts, and that two of these parts have been taken. In 

like manner, the fraction — indicates that the unit has been divided 

b 

into h equal parts, and that a of these parts have been taken. 

8G. Every quantity not expressed under a fractional form is called 
an entire quantity. 

87. An expresssion, made up in part of an entire quantity, and in 
part of a fraction, is called a mixed quantity. Thus, 4 + J, and a — 

— are mixed quantities. 
c 

88. A proper fraction is one in which the numerator is less than the 
denominator. An improper fraction is one in which the numerator is 
greater than the denominator. 

89. A simple fraction is one whose numerator and denominator arc 

simple quantities. Thus, — is a simple fraction. 

90. A compound fraction is one which has a compound expression 

in the numerator or denominator, or in both. Thus, , , 

' c ^ c -\- d 

and -j are compound fractions. 

91. The minus sign before a fraction changes the signs of all the 

terms in the numerator. Thus, is equivalent to . 

b b 

92. A few of the principles involved in operations upon fractions 
will now be demonstrated. 

I. The multiplication of a fraction by an entire quantity is effected 
by multiplying the numerator, or dividing the denominator by the 
entire quantity. 

For to multiply — by r, is to repeat — , c times, and since — taken 



02 ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 

twice, is V> tlivce times is — , &c, the result of multiplyin<2; — , c times 

oc 
will plainly ba — . The multiplication can also be performed by divid- 
ing the denominator by c ; for, if we divide the denominator by f, and 
q is the quotient of the division, then the unit will be divided into c 
times fewer parts than before, and, of course, each part is c times as 
great as before. Now, if we write a over q, we will have taken as 
many parts of the unit as before ; and since each part is c times greater, 

the fraction — is plainly c times greater than the fraction — . 

The multiplication of the numerator by a whole number may also be 

demonstrated in another way. — is taken to be increased c fold, and 

if the denominator remains unchanged, while the numerator is multi- 
plied by c, the number of parts into which the unit is divided remains 
the same, but the number of those parts taken is increased c fold, the 

oc 
new fraction — must then be c fold greater than the old. 
b 

93. II. The division of a fraction by an entire quantity is effected 
by dividing the numerator, or multiplying the denominator by the 
entire quantity. 

For, to divide -- by c, is to diminish the value of the fraction c fold, 

and if the result of the division of a by c is q ; then g' is c times smaller 

than a, and y- is c times smaller than — . Because, while the parts of 

the unit have remained unchanged, c fold fewer of these parts have 
been taken. 

The division can also be effected by multiplying the denominator by 
c, for then the parts into which the unit is divided being increased c 
fold, the value of each part must be decreased c fold, and, of course, 
when the same number of these c fold diminished parts are taken, as at 
first, the result must be c times smaller than before. 

94. III. The value of a fraction is not altered by multiplying the 

numerator and denominator by the same quantity. The fraction -- is 

not altered in value by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 
c. For, to multiply the numerator by c is, from what has just been 



ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 5H 

shown, to increase the value of the fraction c fold, and to multiply the 
denominator by c is to diminish the value of the fraction c fold, and, 
of course, the fraction has undergone no change of value since it has 
been increased and decreased equally. 

95. IV. The viilue of a fraction is not changed by dividing the 
numerator and denominator by the same quantity. Because the two 
divisions cancel each other, and leave the fraction in its primitive 
condition. 

90. Y. If the same quantity be added to the numerator and denomi- 
nator of a proper fraction, the value of the fraction will be increased. 

To show this, it will be necessary to show that if the same quantity 
be added to two quantities differing in magnitude, the smaller of these 
will be increased more, proportionally, than the larger. Take the num- 
bers 1 and 2, add 1 to both, the first will be doubled, but the second 
will not be ; add 3 to both, the first will be increased four fold, while 
the second Avill only be 2'] times greater than before. In general, let 
a and b represent the two quantities, a being less than h- add a to both, 
the first will be doubled, but the second M'ill not be, because a -\- h is 
loss than 2/j. Now, when the same quantity is added to the numerator 
and denominator of a proper fraction, the numerator is increased more 
proportionally than the denominator ; the number of parts taken, then, 
is increased without their being an equal decrease in the size of those 
parts. Hence, the new fraction must be greater than the old. 

97. VI. By adding large quantities to the numerator and denomi- 
nator, we can make the value of the fraction approximate indefinitely 
near, though it can never become unity. Thus, add 1000 to the nume- 
rator and denominator of i, the new fraction is j^o^' al"^os*^^> though 
not quite, unity. Now, add a million to both terms of the fraction, and 
the result will be indefinitely near, without being altogether unity. 

98. VII. If the same quantity is added to the numerator and deno- 
minator of an im]m)per fraction, the value of the fraction will be 
decreased. 

For, the denominator being smaller than the numerator, will be 
increased more proportionally, and the value of the fraction must be 
diminished. 

Take | as an example, add 10, and the fraction becomes |4 <C f- 
It is plain that no addition to the numerator and denominator can ever 
reduce the fraction as low as unity.

REDUCTION OF FKACTIONS. 

99. Tlic reduction of fractious consists in simplifying their forms 
without altering their value. 
Their are 10 cases. 

CASE I. 

To reduce a simple fraction to its simplest form. 

RULE. 

Strike out all the factors common to the numerator and denomi- 
nator^ and the result will he the fraction reduced to its lowest terms.

The expression a, + b, being common to numerator and denominator, 
may be stricken out, since, by Article 95, we can divide both terms of 
the fraction by a + ^ without altering its value

place the remainder , if any, over the denominator for the fractional 
part.

Take 



X -\- a 



"We have a right to divide both terms of the fraction (Article 95) by 
the denominator, and we will not alter the value of the fraction. The 
reduction in Case III, is nothing more than dividing both terms of the 
fraction by the denominator, and, since the new denominator is unity, 
it need not be written.

58 ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 

This case diffei-s from tlic last in two particulars, 1st, It includes

Remarks. 

103. In all these examples, since the quotient is incomplete, it is 
plain that the product of the divisor by the series will not give the 
dividend. 

104. The different results of the same division in 4 and G, 3 and 7, 
show that the series may be changed by changing the order of the 
terms in the divisor; and it might readily be shown that a change in 
the order of the terms in the numerator (when there is more than one 
term) will produce a corresponding change in the series. 



CASE V. 

105. To reduce fractions having different denominators to equivalent 
fractions having the same denominator. 



RULE. 

MuUipli/ each numerator into all the denominators, except its own, 
for a new numerator, and all the denominators together for a common 
denominator of all the new numerators; or, multipli/ each numerator 
hy the quotient arising from the division of the least common multij)le 
of the denominators hy each denominator respectively, and write the 
products thus formed for new numerators over the least common multt- 
jile as a common denominator. 

Reduce — and — to a common denominator.

By the first rule we get — and — , and it is plain that these frac- 
■^ "^ ac ac ^ 

tions have the same value as at first, since each has been multiplied and 

divided by the same quantity. 

X h 

Reduce — ^ and — to a canimon denominator. 



(SO ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS.

the first numerator. The multiplier of the second numerator is — = a.

Hence, the equivalent fractions are — and -„ . It is plain that each 
fraction has been multiplied and divided by the same quantity.

obtained.

CASE VI. 
106. To add fractional quantities top^ether. 

RULE. 

Reduce the fractions^ to a common denominator, if necessary , and 
over this common denominator write the algebraic sum of the new 
numerators. 

Fractions, which have different denominators, cannot be added to- 
gether previous to reduction to the same denominator, because they 
represent different things. Tims, J and 1 neither make i nor | ; the 
first indicates that one of the three parts into which the unit has been 
been divided has been taken ; the second indicates that Ave have taken 
one of the four parts into which unity has been divided. 

Since, therefore, the parts taken are different iu magnitude, they 
cannot be added together. It would, obviously, be just as proper to 
add a peck (the fourth of a bushel) and a quart (the thirty-second part 
of a bushel), and call the sum two pecks, or two quarts, as to add two 
fractions with diflcreut denominators.

107. When none of the terms have been reduced with each other,

108. To subtract one or more fractional quantities from one or more

Write the difference over the common denominator.

different denominators, prove that we cannot subtract fractions with 
unlike denominators. The fractions represent different things until

Let it be required to multiply -j- by — . 



To multiply — by c, is to repeat — , c times ; the result will then 

plainly be — . Because, while the size of the parts into which the unit 
has been divided has remained the same, the number of parts taken has 
been increased c fold. — is then, obviously, c times 2;reater than—-. 

But we were not required to multiply — by c, but by the quotient ari- 
sing from the division of c by d; our multiplier has then been d times 
too great, and, of course, the product is d times too great. The result, 
then, must be corrected by dividing by d. Hence, the true product

Take, as an example, — - to be divided by — . 

The result of the division of — by c must be c times smaller than—.

remained unaltered, tlie size of tlicsc parts has been diminished c fold, 
since their number has been increased c fold. But we were not re- 
quired to divide — by c, but by the quotient of c by d. Our divisor,

form of -J- and -— , can be put under these forms without difficulty.

112. The quotient, multiplied by the divisor, ought to give the divi-

ought to give the other factor. "We are thus enabled to verify our

113. To reduce a compound fraction to its lowest terms. 

Wc have seen tliat a simple fraction can often be reduced by remov- 
ing the factors common to the numerator and denominator. When the 
common factors of a compound fraction can be detected by inspection, 
we have but to remove them, and the fraction is reduced to its lowest 
terms. Thus, 

a'^ + ah — ac 



um -\- an 
can be reduced to its lowest terms by the removal of the common 
factor a. 

But the common factor, or common factors, of a compound fraction 
cannot always be detected by inspection, and some process becomes 
necessary to discover them. This process is called finding the (jrealest 
common divisor. 

114. The greatest quantity that will divide two or more quantities, 
is their greatest common divisor. 

When the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denomina- 
tor of a compound fractions is found, it can be reduced to its lowest 
terms by dividing by this divisor. 

115. The greatest common divisor, though most usually obtained in 
order to reduce compound fractions, is also frequently found between 
(quantities not written in the fractional form. 

IIG. We will then explain the method of finding the greatest com- 
mon divisor between two polynomials, without regarding them as nume- 
rator and denominator of a compound fraction. 

117. The determination of the greatest common divisor of two poly- 
nomials depends upon two principles. 1st. The common divisor of 
two polynomials contains, as factors, all the common factors of the 
two polynomials, and does not contain any other factors. For, let A 
and B be the two polynomials, and D their greatest common divisor. 
Now, it is plain that any quantity C, made up of a part of the common 
factors of A and B, would divide both quantities, and would, therefore, 
be a common divisor ; but C, multiplied by the remaining factors com- 
mon to A and B, would still divide them. Hence, C would be a divi- 
sor, but not the greatest divisor of A and B. 

Again, any quantity M, made up of all, or a part, of the common fac- 



ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 69 

tors of A and B, and containing also a factor, d, not common to the 
two polynomials, will not divide them. For, if we proceed to the divi- 
sion, the common factors of A, B, and M will strike out, and leave the 
factor (1 as a denominator of the reduced polynomials. Thus, ad will 
not divide a^ -f ah and ac + am ; for, though it contains their common 
factor, a, it also contains a factor d, not common. The result of the 

division will be , and - — - — . The greatest common divisor, D. 
a d 

then, contains all the common factors of A and B, and contains nu 

other factors. 

118. 2d. The greatest common divisor of two polynomials, A and B, 
will enter into the successive remainders which arise from dividing A 
by B, and B by the remainder, and the second remainder by the first, 
aud so on, until there is no remainder. 

For, denote by A' and B' the quotients arising from dividing A and 
B by the greatest common divisor, D ; then A = A'D, and B = B'D. 
Divide A by B ; or, what is the same thing, divide A'D by B'D, aud 
call the quotient Q. 

Thus, A'D I B'D 

QB'D Q 

(A' — QB') D = 1st Bemaindcr = MD. 
by making A' — QB' = IM. 

We see that the first remainder contains the greatest common divisor; 
and as it is also in the divisor, wc have a right to seek it between these 
polynomials. 

Now, divide B'D by the remainder, and call the new quotient (7, 

and we get 

B'D I MD 

Q':md q ' 

(B' — Q'M) D = 2d Kemaindcr = XD, 
representing B' — Q'M by it. 

Wc see that the greatest common divisor enters also into the second 
remainder; and as it is also in the first remainder, we have a right 
to seek it between these two remainders. Divide MD byND; the 
remainder, if any, will still contain the greatest common divisor. 

119. Let us apply these principles in finding the greatest common 
divisor of the polynomials, A and B. 

First arrange them with respect to a certain letter, and regard that 
polynomial which contains the highest power of this letter as the divi- 



70 ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 

dend, and the other polynomial as the divisor. Next, examine if A 
(which we suppose the dividend) contains a factor common to all its 
terms, but not common to all the terms of B. By the first principle, 
this factor can constitute no part of the common divisor, and may be 
suppressed. It is not absolutely necessary to suppress it, because it 
will disappear in division, and not appear in the remainder, and, there- 
fore, by the second principle, cannot make part of the greatest common 
divisor. But if there is a factor common to all the terms of B, and not 
common to those of A, it must be suppressed. For A would not be, 
divisible by B until it had been multiplied by the common factor of B, 
and the multiplication would make this factor common to A and B ; 
and, hence, by the first principle, it must be common to the divisor. 
The greatest common divisor would then contain a factor which did not 
originally belong to A. 

120. If there is a factor common to A and B which can be detected 
by inspection, it may be divided out and set aside, as making part of 
the greatest common divisor. 

121. The next step, after setting aside, or suppressing factors seen 
by inspection, is to divide A by B. If the coefiicient of the first term 
of A is not divisible by the coefiicient of the first term of B, it may be 
made divisible by multiplying all the terms of A by the coefiicient of 
the first term of B, or by any other quantity that will make the division 
possible. This multiplication will not efi"ect the result, because the 
factor introduced into it will disappear in the division. 

122. The remainder, after division of A by B, will contain the great- 
est common divisor ; and, as B also contains it by hypothesis, we have 
a right to seek it between B and the remainder. The second remain- 
der, if any, contains D also, but its coefficient or multiplier is smaller 
than in the first remainder; and so tlie coefiicient of J), in each re- 
mainder, is smaller than in the preceding, until it finally becomes unity. 
"When this final remainder is used as a divisor, it will go as many times 
in the preceding divisor as there are units in the coefficient of D in 
that divisor, and there will be no remainder. 

123. When, therefore, wc get a remainder zero, we conclude that 
the last divisor is D X 1, or D itself. 

124. If the given polynomials have no common divisor, we can dis- 
cover the fact by the same tests that show when one polynomial is not 
divisible by another. We will find either that the letter, according to 
which the arrangement has been made, has disappeared from some of 



ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 71 

the remainders, or it enters to a higher power in that remainder which 
is used as a divisor than in the one used as a dividend. 

The preceding principles and demonstrations for finding the greatest 
common divisor lead to the following 



RULE. 

125. Arraivje the two polynomials with reference to a certain letter, 
as in division; use that one tchich contains the highest j^oicer of this 
letter as the dividend. 

2d. Next, set aside the factors, if any, common to dividend and 
divisor, as part of the greatest common divisor, and suj^ress those fac- 
tors tohich are common to the one and not to the other. 

3c7. Prepare the dividend, if necessary, for division, hy multiplying 
hy any quantity that loill make its first term divisible hy the first term

in the remainder any factor that may he common to cdl its terms and 
not common to those^of the divisor. 

Aih. Use the remainder so reduced as a divisor, and the last divisor 
as a dividend, and proceed c(s before; and continue in tliis manner,

The factor suppressed in the first remainder might have been + 2y, 

instead of — 2?/. The greatest common divisor then would have been 

— c — X. And, in general, the two polynomials have two greatest 

common divisors, differing in the signs of all their terms. The reason

126. If we had multiplied, to prepare for division, by the first in- 
stead of the second power of the cocfiicient of the first terra, we would 
only have found one term in the quotient by the first division, and it 
would have been necessary to multiply the remainder by the coefficient 
of the first term to obtain a second term of the quotient. It is easier 
to prepare the polynomial by multiplying by the second power of the 
coefficient of the first term.

127. In the above examples, the difference of the exponents of the 
arranged letter being two, we multiply by the square of the coefficient 
of the first term of the divisor to prepare the dividend for division. It 
could have been prepared by multiplying by 3, but we would only have 
gotten one term in the quotient, and there Avould have been two re- 
mainders to prepare for division. 

In general, when preparation for division is necessary, we save time 
by multiplying the dividend by the coefficient of the first term of the 
divisor, raised to a power one greater than the difference of exponents 
of the arranged letter in the first terms of the two polynomials.

128. The last two examples show the importance of suppressing tho 
factor common to the remainder and not common to the divisor. 

Greatest common divisor of three or more polynomials. 

129. The foregoing principles can be readily extended to finding the 
greatest common divisor of three or more polynomials. It is evident, 
that if we use one of the polynomials as a divisor, and divide all the 
others by it, that the remainders, if any, must contain the common 
divisor of all the polynomials. Suppress, in each of these remainders, 
the factors not common to the polynomial used as a divisor, and take 
that remainder which contains the lowest power of the arranged letter 
as the new divisor, and divide the other remainders by it; and con- 
tinue in this way until we get an exact divisor; it will be the GCD 
sought. To illustrate by an example, find the GCD of 

a-2 + ax — 2.V — 2r(, :r^ — .>• — 2, and ./'^ — 2./-' — 4.r + 8. 

Use x^ — X — 2 as the divisor, the remainder will be 

ax — X— 2a + 2, or a (x — 2) — {x — 2) = (./ — !) (x — 2), 
and — a;- — 2a; + 8 

Suppress the factor, a — 1, in the first remainder, and the result, 
X — 2, will exactly divide the other two remainders ; hence, x — 2 is 
the greatest common divisor of the given polynomials. 

Again, take 
x''+ax + x + a, x'' + Sx^ + ?jx^l, and x^ + 2x'' — ax^ — 2ax -f .x — a. 



76 ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 

Use the first as the divisor; tlie three remainders will he

130. It will be seen that the GCD of any number of polynomials, as 
well as for two, may have its sign changed. Thus, the last GCD may 
he X — 1, or 1 — X, and so for the others. 

LEAST COMxMON MULTIPLE. 

131. The least common multiple of two or more quantities, is the 
least quantity that they will exactly divide. Thus, the least common 
multiple of 2, 4, and 6, is 12; of a^, a, and h, is a-h; of a^ + ah, I and 
^/, is a^h^ + «Z/, &c. It is plain that the product of all the quantities 
will be a common multiple of these quantities; that is, it will be exactly 
divisible by them. Thus, 2x4x6 = 24 is a common multiple of 2, 
4, and 6, but it is not their least common multiple. In like manner, 
a'^h is a common multiple of a^, a, and h, but not their least common 
multiple. Multiply a common multiple by anything whatever, the pro- 
duct will still be a common multiple. Hence, there may bo an infinite 
number of common multiples, but there can be but one least common 
multiple. 

132. No quantity will be divisible by another, unless it contains all 
the factors of the second quantity. So, no quantity will be divisible 
by two or more quantities, unless it is divisible by each, and by all the 
factors of these quantities. To be the least common multiple of the 
given quantities, it must contain no more factors than they contain; and 
these factors must not enter to higher powers than in the given quan- 
tities. Thus, abc is not the least common multiple of a and h, because 



ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 77 

it contains a factor, c, that they do not contain. Neither is a^b the 
least common muhiple^ because the factor a enters to a higher power 
than in the given quantities. The expressions abc, and a^b, are multi- 
ples, but not hast common multiples. 

133. If the given quantities contain a common factor, this must 
enter into the least common multiple raised to the highest power ti) 
which it is raised in the expressions to be divided, but it must not be 
repeated. 

134. It must enter to the highest power, else the multiple which we 
formed would not be divisible by the expression containing the highest 
power of the common factor, and it must must not be repeated, else the 
multiple would not be the least common multiple. 

135. From these principles we derive the following 

RULE. 

Decompose the given quantities into their prime factors, form a pro- 
duct composed of all the factors not common, and of the highest powers 
of the common factors, talcinfj care to let no factor enter more than 
once. The product so formed will le the least common multiple 
required. 

Form the least common multiple of ax^, a^x, bx*, and a'. 

Decomposing, we have a.x^, a^.x, h.x*, and a'. 

Hence, least common multiple, a'^.x*.b = aVjx*. 

It is plain that the common factor, a, must enter to the highest 
power (the third) to which it enters in one of the given quantities, 
else the multiple would not be divisible by that quantity. It is also 
plain that x must enter to the highest power, and that the factor b, 
not common, must also form part of the least common multiple, other- 
wise, the expression coutaiuiug b would not be a divisor. 

Form the least common multiple of 2, 8, 3, 9, a, a^, and 5b. 

Decomposing into factors we have 2, 2', 3, 3^, a, o?, h.b. 

Hence, 2'.3^.alZ».5 = 360a^i is the least common multiple required. 

By inspecting the result, 2^, 3^, ha^.b, it is plain that it is the least 
common multiple. It is divisible by 2, because it contains a factor 2^ ; 
7* 



78 ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 

by 8, because it contains 2^; by 3, because it contains 3^, &c. More- 
over, it is the least product that will divide the given quantities, for it 
is made up of the least factors that will fulfil the required conditions. 
The number 2 need not be raised to the third power to divide 2, but 
it must be to divide 8 ; so 3 need not be raised to the second power to 
divide 3, but it must be to divide 9. 

We see, too, that no factor has been taken more than once.

CoraUarj/. 

136. The least common multiple of two or more quantities can also 
be found by dividing their product by the greatest common divisor. 
For, in the division of the product of the quantities by their greatest 
common divisor, the lowest powers of their common factors alone are 
divided out, and the quotient is made up of the factors not common, 
multiplied by those that are common, raised to the highest powers to 
which they enter in any of the given quantities, which, as we have 
seen, is the composition of the least common multiple. 

137. Conversely, if we know the least common multiple of two or 
more quantities, we can find their greatest common divisor by multi- 
plying the quantities together, and dividing their product by the least 
common multiple. For, let A, B, and C denote the quantities, D, their 
greatest common divisor, and L their least common multiple. Then, 

since = L, -^ — = D. This relation between the greatest com- 

mon divisor and the least common multiple, enables us to verify our 
results iu finding either. 



ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS. 



LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE OF FRACTIONS. 

138. It is often important to find the least common multiple of frac- 
tions, and as the rule for finding it for entire quantities fails in this 
case, it becomes necessary to demonstrate another nxle. 

Let us take the fractions 

"We arc required to find the least quantity that they will exactly divide, 
and give entire quotients. Now, to divide by a fraction, is to divide 
by the numerator, and multiply by the denominator. The quantity, 

then, that will be divisible by one of the fractions, as -— , must be divi- 
de 

sible by a^, or it will not be divisible after it has been multiplied by hc^. 
And, as the same reasoning may be extended to the other fractions, the 
quantity sought must evidently be divisible by each of the numerators ; 
and, in order to be the least quantity that will fulfil this condition, it 
must be the least common multiple of the numerators. But, since the 
denominators are to be multiplied by this least common multiple of the 
numerators, it is plain that a^h cannot be the quantity sought. For, 
rt^i, the least common multiple of the numerators, divided by any quan- 
tity that will exactly divide the denominators, will be a smaller quantity 

than aH> itself. For instance, — will be divisible by the given quan- 
tities, and be a smaller quantity than a^b. It is plain, too, that a^b, 
divided by the greatest quantity that will divide the denominators, will 

still be smaller than -— , and will be the smallest quantity that will be 

exactly divisible by the given quantities. Hence, -j. is the least com- 
mon multiple of the fractions

The demonstration being founded upon the hypothesis, that the frac-

applicable to such fractions. 



GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR OF FRACTIONS. 

140. The greatest common divisor of two or more fractions is the 
greatest quantity that will exactlj"^ divide them, giving entire quotients. 

This quantity must be a fraction ; for nothing but a fraction will 
divide a fraction reduced to its lowest terms, and give an entire quo- 
tient. The greatest common divisor of several fractions will then be a 
fraction itself; and since, when we divide a fraction by another frac- 
tion, we divide the numerator of the fraction assumed as the dividend 
by the numerator of the fraction taken as the divisor, and divide the 
denominator of the divisor by the denominator of the dividend, it fol- 
lows, that the divisor sought must have a numerator that will divide 
each of the numerators of the given fractions, and a denominator that 



ALGEBRAIC FRACTlbXS. 81 

will be divisible by each of the given denominators. But, since the 
value of a fraction increases with the increase of its numerator and the 
decrease of its denominator, it is plain that a fraction, whose numerator 
would divide all the given numerators, and whose denominator would 
be divisible by all the given denominators, would not be the greatest

142. The greatest common divisor of entire quantities may be unity, 
and the quantities are then said to be prime with respect to each other. 
But it is evident that fractions can never be prime with respect to each

other; for, though their nuniertators may be prime, as in the 3d, 4th, 
and 6th examples, the least common multiple of their denominators can 
always be formed. 

143. We may also remark that, as the least common multiple of 
entire quantities can always be formed ; so, likewise, all fractions what- 
ever have a least common multiple. 

144. Knowing the least common multiple of any number of frac- 
tions, we can find their greatest common divisor by multiplying the 
fractious together, and dividing their product by their least common 
multiple. 

145. Conversely, knowing their greatest common divisor, we can 
find their least common multiple by multiplying the fractions together, 
and dividing the product by the greatest common divisor. 



EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 

146. An Equation is an expression containing two equal quantities, 
with the sign of equality between them. Thus, cc = a — & is an equa- 
tion, and expresses, that the quantity represented by x is equal to the 
dilTerence of the quantities represented by a and b. 

147. The part on the left of the sign of equality is called the y?rs^ 
member of the equation, and that on the right the second member. 

148. Problems can be stated or expressed, and their solutions ob- 
tained by means of equations ; that is, we can express, in algebraic lan- 
guage, the relation between an unknown quantity to be found, and one 
or more known quantities, and, by certain opcratioas, can find the value 
of the unknown quantity. 

149. The expressing the relation is called the statement of the pro- 
blem; and the operation performed after the statement, to find the 
value of the unknown quantity, is called the sohUion of the problem. 
Thus, let it bo required to find a quantity, which, being added once to 
itself, will give a sum equal to h. Let x be the unknown quantity; 
then, by the conditions, x + x = b, or, 2x = b. Then, if twice x is 

equal to b, x itself must be equal to half of b, raid x = — is the final 

result. In tiiis, making the equation, .r -\- x = & is tlie statement, 



EQUATIO-NS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. S3 

and the subsequent operation is the solution. If the vakie found for 
the unknown quantitity ( — j be substituted in the equation x -\-x = h, 

we will have —+ — =/>, a true eqviation. When the value found 

for the unknown quantity substituted in the equation of the problem 
makes the two members equal to each other, the equation is said to be 
satisfied, and we conclude that the solution is true. 

150. The unknown quantity, the thing to be found, is usually repre- 
sented by one of the final letters of the alphabet, x, i/, and z. Known 
quantities are generally represented by the first letters of the alphabet, 
a, I), c, and cL 

151. An equation with one unknown quantity is of the first degree, 
when the highest exponent of the unknown quantity in any term is 
unity; of the second, when the highest exponent of the unknown 
quantity in any term is two, &e. 

X + a = 5 is an equation of the first degree. 

x^ -\- X = a is an equation of the second degree. 

x'^ -\- x^ -]- X = a is an equation of the third degree. 

X* -\- px^ + mx^ + nx = a is an ef[uation of the fourth degree. 

152. Equations which contain the unknown quantity from the high- 
est to the first power inclusive, are called complete equations. The 
above are all complete equations with one unknown quantity. 

153. Equations in which some of the powers of the unknown quan- 
tity are missing, are called incomplete equations, x^ = a is an incom- 
plete equation of the second degree, x^ + x^ = a is an incomplete 
equation of the third degree. 

154. A numerical equation is one in which all the known quantities 
are represented by numbers. Thus, .v^ + 2x = 4 is a numerical 
equation. 

155. A literal equation is one in which all the quantities, known 
and unknown, are represented by letters. Thus, x'^ + ax = h is a 
literal equation. 

156. An equation in which the known quantities are partly repre- 
sented by letters, and partly by numbers, is a mixed equation. Thus, 
x^ + ax = h -\- 2 is a mixed equation. 



84 EQUATIONS OF THE FlUST DEGREE, 

157. An identical cfjuatiou is one in wliich the two members differ 
only in form, if they differ at aU. Thus, 2x = — , ^^^^ — = x + —, 
and X = X, arc identical equations. 

158. An iiiJctcrminatc equation is one in which the value of the 
unknown quantity is indeterminate, 

159. A single equation with two unknown quantities is necessarily 
indeterminate, for we must assume the value of one before we can 
determine that of the other. Thus, a: -f y = 10 is an indeterminate 
C(]uation, because, by assuming ?/ = 1, 5, 4, &,c., we find x = 9, 5, 6, 
&c. And, by attributing an infinite number of arbitrary values to i/, 
there will be an infinite number of values for x. 

IGO. All identical equations are necessarily indeterminate. Thus, 
the equation x = x will be true, or satisfied, when x is 1, 10, 1000, or 
anything whatever. 

161. The oivn sign of a quantity is the sign with which the quantity 
is affected previous to any operation being performed upon it. The 
essential sign is the sign with which it is affected after the operation. 
Thus, multiply + « by — 1 ; the own sign of a is plus, and its essen- 
tial sign minus. Eut, multiply + a by + 1, and the own and essen- 
tial signs are the same. Subtract + ^ from a, then a — (-(-&) = a 
— h. Here, h appears in the second member with the essential sign. 

162. Since a positive quantity cannot be equal to a negative, and, 
conversely, it is evident that the essential sign of the two members of 
an equation must be the same. 

163. Since quantities can only be equal to quantities of the same 
kind, it is plain that the two members of an equation must be composed 
of quantities of the same kind. Thus, if one member represent time, 
the other must represent time also. 

These two principles are important, and ought to be remembered. 

164. Several axioms, or self-evident propositions, are assumed as the 
basis of the principles by which equations are solved. 

1. If equals be added to or subtracted from equals, the results will 
be equal. 

2. If equals be multiplied or divided by equals, the results will be 
equal.

SOLUTION OF EQUATIOXS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 

165. The transformation of an equation consists in changing its form, 
without destroying the equality of the two members. 
There are three transformations of equations. 

First TraitKjurmatlon. 

IGG. The first transformation consists in clearing an equation of its 
fractions. 

By the second axiom, we have a right to multiply botli nicmhers of 
an equation by the same quantity ; and it is evident that if we multi- 
ply the two members by the least common multij^lc of the denominators, 
the resulting equation will be free of fractions. For, since each deno- 
minator will divide the least common multiple, it is plain that the pro- 
duct of each numerator by the least common multiple will be divisible 

by each denominator. Thus, take the equation — + '-+2=4, mul- 
tiply each member by 0, the least common multiple of the denomina- 
tors, and the resulting equation is 3x + a^ + 12 = 24. 

It is plain, that if we multiply the two members by 12, the product 
of the denominators, the resulting equation will also be free from frac- 
tions. For each denominator will divide the product of 12 by its 
numerator, inasmuch as it will divide 12 itself. Multiplying by 12, 
we get G.T + 2ic + 24 = 48. Now, divide both members by 2, which 
we have a right to do by the second axiom, and we get 3x -f- a; = 12, 
the same equation as before. 

Again, take the equation — + — + ^ + 2 = 5. 

By the first method (the least common multiple being 12), we get 
i\x + 2x + ox + 24 = GO. By the second method, we get 24a; + 8x 
+ 12.r + 96 = 240. Divide both members by 4, and the results are 
the same. It willbe seen that the second method is the same as mul- 
tiplying each numerator into all the denominators except its own, and 
each entire quantity by ttie product of all the denominators.

167. This consists in transposing known terms to the second mem- 
ber, and unknown terras to the first member. 

Take the equation 2x — 2 = x -f- a. (1) 

By the first axiom, we have a right to add + 2 to both members of 
the equation. Adding, we have 2a; — 2 + 2 = a; + a-r2; or, since 
the — 2 and + 2 destroy each other in the first member, the equation 
becomes 2x = x -\- a -\- 2. By comparing this with the equation 
marked (1), we see that 2 has passed into the second member, by 
changing its sign. 

Resume the equation 2x = x + a + 2, and add minus x to both 
members. AYe get 2x — x = x — x + a -{- 2 ; or, since + x and 
— X destroy each other in the second member, 2x — x = a + 2. 
Hence, x has passed into the first member by changing its sign. 

We have demonstrated that quantities can be transposed from one 
member to another, provided we change their signs, since transiDosition 
is nothing more than adding to both members the quantities to be 
transposed, with their signs changed. The demonstration can be as 
readily made by subtracting the quantities with their appropriate signs. 
Hence, the second transformation is equivalent to adding to both mem- 
bers the quantities to be transposed, with their signs changed, or sub- 
tracting these quantities with their own signs from both members. 



RULE. 

Change the &!<jn of each term trans/erred from one member to 
another. 

Third Tran formation. 

168. The third transformation consists in clearing the unknown 
qitantity of its coefficient or coefficients. 

Besume the equation, Qx-\-2x + ^x -\ 24 = 60; then, by the second 
transformation, we have 6x -f 2x -f Sx = 60 — 24 = .36. This indi- 
cates that the sum of 6^:", 2x, and 2>x is equal to 36 ; hence, obviously, 
llx = 36. Now, by the second axiom, we have a right to divide both 



EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 87 

members by the same quantity. Divide by 11, and we have x = |f . 
The unknown quantity now stands unconnected with known terms, and 
we have its trae value. 

Take ax -^-hx — ex =■ m. 

By the rules for factorinir, we have (a + h — c) x = m; and by 

the second axiom, x = ; . 

a -\- b — c 

These illustrations show that the third transformation is used when 
the equation has been cleared of its fractions, if it contained any, and 
when all the known quantities in the first member have been removed 
to the second, and when all the terms involving the unknown quan- 
tity have been placed in the first member, if not already there. 

RULE. 

Collect into a single algebraic sum all the corfficicnfs of the vnhioicn 
quantity, and divide the two memhers hij this sum; if there is hut one

1G9. It will be seen tliat the object of the three traiisforniatious is 
to free the unknown quantity of its connection with known terms, and 
make it stand alone in the first member of the equation. When so 
situated, its true value is known, being expressed by the second mem- 
ber of the equation. 

170. The various steps in the solution of an equation, can be best 
illustrated by taking an example which will require all three trans- 
formations. 

Take • |-f ^+ fl = 6_2:r. 

First step. To clear the equation of its fractions. 

Result. 5x + ^x + 10a = 10Z> — 20a:. 

Second step. To get the known terms to second member, and un- 
known to first member. 

Result bx -\- ^x + 20a) = lOi — 10a. 

Third step. To clear the unknown quantity of its coefficient. 

Result. X = - — ^ = ~ \ 

171. Frequently, only two transformations are necessary in the solu- 
tion of an equation ; sometimes only one, but always at least one. 

Take ax -\- h = c. 

r — h 
By second transformation, ax ^ c — h ; and by third, x = . 

Take 2x — ox = m} then, by third transformation, — x = m. 

In this the unknown quantity appears with the negative sign ; but 
we were required to find the value of + a; and not of — x. Multiply 
both members by minus unity, which we have a right to do by the 
second axiom, and — x becomes positive. Hence, x = — m is the 
required value. 

172. In general, when the sign of the unknown quantity is negative 
in the final result, and the conditions of the problem require it to be 
aflfected with the positive sign, both members must be multiplied by 
minus unity. 

173. We observe, also, that the signs of all the terms of an equation 



EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 89 

can be changed without altering the equality of the two members, since 
we have a right to multiply these members by minus unity.

170. Solufions of prohhms produciuij equations of the first di^yree 
with an unknoicn quantity. 

It has been remarked, that the solution of a problem consist.s of two 
distinct parts, the statement and the solution. 

The examples just uiven, illustrate the manner of solving the equa- 
tion after the statement has been made. 

No general rules can be given for making the statement, which de- 
pends mainly upon the ingenuity of the student. 

Sometimes there is but a single thing to be determined, and in that 
case, by representing it by one of the final letters of the alphabet, and 
following the conditions of the problem, we get the equation or state- 
ment required. 

Often, however, two or more things are to bo determined, then the 
undetermined quantity, upon which the other quantities depend, is re- 
presented by one of the final letters of the alphabet. 

As an example of the first class of problems, let it be required to 
find a quantity, which, added to half itself, will give a sum equal 
to 6. 



92 EQUATIONS or Tin: first degree. 

Let X represent the quantity, then half of the quantity will be repre- 
sented by l.r, and by the conditions we liavc x -\- Jx = G. Solving 
the equation, we get x = i. 

As an example of the second class of problems, take the following : 
A man invests half of his money in State stocks, and a third of the 
remainder in a Savings' Institution, and has four hundred dollars left. 
Required the entire amount of his capital, and the amount of each of 
his two investments. 

Since his investments depend upon his capital, let x = capital. 



placed in Savings' Institution. The remainder, after these investments, 
is plainly x — (Jx -f i^) ) but this remainder is, by the conditions of 
the problem, equal to four hundred dollars. Hence, x — (•].« -|- \x^ 
= 400. Solving, we get x = 1200. 

Then, i^x = 600, Investment in State stock. 

ix = 200, " in Savings' Institution. 

400, The amount uninvested. 

1200, Original capital. 

The solution has been verified by adding the two investments to 
what was left, and getting a sum equal to the original capital. The 
solutions of all problems ought to be verified in a similar manner. 

We have seen that an equation is said to be satisfied when the value 
found for the unknown quantity substituted in the given equation, 
makes the two members equal to each other 

But the value of the unknown quantity in the solution of a problem 
must not only satisfy the equation of the problem (the statement), but 
must also fulfil the required conditions. In consequence of the use of 
negative quantities in Algebra, the equation of the problem (the state- 
ment), is often satisfied, when the required conditions are not fulfilled 
in a strict, arithmetical sense. 

As an illustration, let it be required to find a quantity, which, when 
added to 4, will give a sum equal to 2. Let x be the quantity, then 
•r + 4=2. Hence, x = —2. Now, — 2 will satisfy the equation 
of the problem, but will not fulfil the conditions in an arithmetical 
sense; for we were required to find a quantity, which, when added to 
4, would give a sum equal to 2, and the quantity found is really to be 
taken from 4. 



EQUATIONS or THE FIRST DEGREE. 93 

It will be seen hereafter, that there are several cases in which the 
equation may be satisfied, and the conditions not fulfilled. 



A farmer has two kinds of oats ; the one kind worth 80 cents per 
bushel; the other 20 cents per bushel. He mixes 50 bushels of the 
superior article with a certain amount of the inferior, and sells the mix- 
ture at 22 cents per bushel. How much of the second quality did 
he put with the first in order to make the rate of sale the same? 

Let X represent the amount of the inferior article ; then, by the con- 
dition, 50 . 30 -f 2Qx = (50 -H x) 22. Hence, x-= 200. In this 
example, the verification of the equation and the fulfilment of the con- 
ditions are the same. 

2. A farmer has 50 bushels of oats, worth 30 cents per bushel, and 
200 bushels, worth 20 cents per bushel. He mixes the two lots to- 
gether. At what price ought he to sell the mixture ? 

Let X represent the required price of the mixture per bushel; then, 
50 . 30 -f 20 . 200 = 250x. Hence, x = 22. 

3. What number must be subtracted from the numerator and deno-

Ans. The greater, 7^+7^, the smaller — — — . 

AVe see from this result that, knowing the sum and difference of two 
quantities, we get the greater by adding the half sum to the half diffe- 
rence, and the less, by subtracting the half difference from the half 
sum. 

This formula is of extensive application, and ought to be remem- 
bered.

177. Ratio is the quotient arising from dividing one quantity by 
another of the same kind. Thus, if M and N represent quantities 

of the same kind, then — expresses the ratio of M to X. 

Four quantities, M, N, P, and Q, are said to be proportional when 
the ratio of the first to the second is the same as that of the third to 
the fourth. 

Thus, 04, 8, 10, and 2 constitute a proportion, because the first, 
divided by the second, is equal to the third divided by the fourth. 

The proportionality of four quantities, M, N, P, and Q, is expressed 
thus, M : N : : P : Q, and is read, M is to N as P is to Q. 

The first and last terms of a proportion are called the extremes ; the 
second and third the means. Of four proportional quantities, the first 
and third are called antecedents ; the other two, consequents. Of three 
quantities, M, N, and P ; when M : X : : N : P, then X is said to be 
a mean proportional between M and P; and X is, at the same time, 
antecedent and consequent. 

Two quantities, M and X, are said to be reciprocally proportional, 
when the one increases as fast as the other diminishes. One of the 
quantities must be equal to a fraction with a constant numerator, and 
with the other quantity for its denominator.

Equi-multiples of two quantities are the products wliicli arise from 
multiplying tlicm by the same quantity. Thus, aJI and oN are equi- 
multiples of M and N. the common factor being a. 

Theorem I. 

If four quantities are in proportion, the product of the extremes ■will 
equal the product of the means. 

]M P 

Foi', when M : N : : P : Q, we know that — = — ; and by clearing 

of fractions, MQ = PN.. 

This theorem furnishes an important test of the proportionality of 
four quantities. Whenever the product of the extremes is equal to 
that of the means, the proportion is true ; and when that is not the 
case, it is a false proportion. 



Theorem II, 

178. When the product of two quantities is equal to the product of 
two other quantities, two of them may be taken as the extremes, and 
two as the means of a proportion. 

For, suppose ]MQ = NP, divide both members by QN, the first mem- 

M P MP 

ber will become — , and the second — , and we have — = — . From

which we get the proportion INI : N : : P : Q. 
Let 2 . 4 = 8 . 1. Then 2 : 8 : : 1 : 4. 



Theorem III. 

179. The square of a mean proportional is equal to the product of 
the other two terms of the proportion. 

For, from the definition of a mean proportional, we have M : N : : 
N : P ; hence, by Theorem I., N^" = MP. 
Let 2 : 4 : : 4 : 8. Then 4^ = 2 . 8 = 16. 

Theorem IV. 

180. W^hen four quantities are in proportion, they will also be in 
proportion by alternation ; that is, when antecedent is compared with 
antecedent, and consequent with consequent. 

For, let M : N : : P : Q; then, by Theorem I., MQ = NP, and 



GEOMETRICAL PROPORTION. 97 

dividing tliis equation, member b}' member, by PQ, we get 1^ = j^ , 

from whicb M : P : : N : Q. 

Let 4 : 8 : : 12 : 24. Then, also, 4 : 12 : : 8 : 24. 



Theoiiem V. 

181. When four quantities arc in proportion, they will be in propor- 
tion when taken inversely/; that is, when the consec^uents take the 
place of antecedents, and tlic antecedents the place of consequents. 

Let M : N : : P : Q; then, also, we have MQ = XP, or NP = MQj 

divide both members by ^MP, and we get ^ = — , from which X : 
M : : Q : P. 

Theorem VI. 

182. If four quantities are in proportion, they will be in proportion 
by composition ; that is when the sum of antecedent and consequent is 
compared with either antecedent or consequent. 

M P 

Let M : N : : P : Q; thcn^ also, ^ = — . Add 1 to both membei-s,

and reduce to a common denominator, and we have — r^: — = — --r — , 

from which we get jM + X : N : : P + Q : Q. 

Let 4 : 12 : : 8 : 24. Then 4 -f 12 : 12 : 8 + 24 : 24. 

In like manner it may be shown, that when M : N : : P : Q, that 
we will also have M + X : :M : : P + Q : P- 



Theorem VII. 

183. When four quantities are in proportion, they will also be in 
proportion by division ; that is, when the difference of antecedent and 
consequent is compared with either antecedent or consequent. 

M P 

Let !iM : X : : P : Q ; then, also, we have — = — . Subtract 1 from

both members, and reduce to a common denominator, we will have 

M — N P — Q 

j^ = —T^, from which we get 31 — X : X : : P — Q : Q. 

Let 12 : 4 : : 24 : 8. Then 12 — 4 : 4 : : 24 — 8 : 8. 

It may be shown in like manner, that when four quantities are in

Let 12 : 4 : : 24 : 8. Then, also, 12 — 4 : 12 :: 24 — 8 : 24. 



Theorem VIII. 

184. Equi-multiples of any two quantities are proportional to the 
quantities themselves. 

For, take the identical proportion, M : N : : IM : N ; then MN = 
NM. Multiply both members by in, and there results mM . N = 
mN . M ; and, since mM and ?>iN may be regarded as single terms, we 
have from Theorem 2d, M : N : : mM : mN. 

Let 1 and 2 be multiplied by the same number, 3 ; then 1.2:: 
1.3:2.3: or 1 . 2 : : 3 : 6. 



Theorem IX. 

185. If equi-multiples of the antecedents of four proportional quan- 
tities, and also equi-multiples of the consequents be taken, the four 
resulting quantities will be proportional. 

For, let M : N : : P : Q ; then MQ = NP. Multiplying both mem- 
bers by inn, and there results mM . «Q = «N . 5»P. Hence, mM : 
tcN : : mP : iiQ. 

Let 1 : 2 : : 4 : 8, and take m = 4, and n — 3. 

Then 4 . 1 : 3 . 2 : : 4 . 4 : 3 . 8 ; or 4 : 6 : : 16 : 24. 

It is plain that the above theorem is equally true when m = n. So, 
that all the terms of a proportion may be multiplied by the same quan- 
tity without destroying the proportionality of the terms. An infinite 
number of proportions may then be formed from a single proportion. 

Theorem X. 

186. If there be two sets of four proportional quantities, having two 
terms, the same in both, the remaining terms will constitute a pro- 
portion. 

Let M : N : : P : Q. 

M : N : : R : S. 
Then, MQ = NP, or NP = ^^IQ. 

MS = NR and NR = MS. 



GEOMETRICAL PROPORTIOX. 99 

P Q 

Dividing these equations member by memocr, we get — - = — -, from 

which, P : R : : Q : S, or P : Q : : R : S. (Art. 180). 

And the same property can evidently be shown when any other two 
terms are equal. 
Let 1 : 2 : : 4 : 8. 

1 : 2 : : 6 : 12. Then 4 : G : : 8 : 12, or 4 : 8 : : (i : 12. 
Let 1 : 2 : : 4 : 8. 

1 : 3 : : 4 : 12. Then 2 : 3 : : 8 : 12, or 2 : 8 : : 8 : 12. 

It will be seen that the corresponding terms of the proportion must 
be taken in connection with each other. 



Theorem XI. 

187. Of four proportional quantities, if the two antecedents be aug- 
mented or diminished by quantities which are proportional to the two 
consequents, the resulting quantities will be proportional to the con- 
sequents. 

For, let M : N : : P : Q. 

N : Q : : R : S. 
Then, MQ = NP. (A). 

NS = QR. 
Or, QR = NS. (B). 

Adding and subtracting (B) from (A), there results Q (M =b R) = 
N (P d= S). Hence, 31 ± R : P ± S : N : Q. 
Let 1 : 2 : : 4 : 8. 
And 3 : 6 : : 4 : 8. Then 1 =b 3 : 2 d= 6 : : 4 : 8. 

It can be shown in like manner, that if the two consequents be aug- 
mented or diminished by quantities, which are proportional to the 
antecedents, the resulting quantities Avill be proportional to the ante- 
cedents. 

The reciprocal of a ([uantity is unity divided by the quantity ; thus, 

the reciprocal of A is -r- . 
A 

Theorem XII. 

188. Two quantities are inversely proportional to their reciprocals. 
For, take the identical proportion A : B : : A : B ; then AB = B A. 



100 GEOMETRICAL PROPORTION. 

Divide botli members by AB ; then 

Hence, A : B : : - : -. Thus, 2 : 3 : : -J : ^. 
j> A 



Theorem XIII. 

189. If there are any number of proportions having the same ratio, 
any one antecedent will be to its consequent as the sum of all the ante- 
cedents to the sum of all the consequents. 

For, let M:N::P:Q. 

M : N : : A : B. 
M : N : : C : D. 
M : N : : E : F. J 

Tlien, MQ = NP. 

MB = NA. 
MD = NC. 
MF = NE. 

Adding these equations member by member, we get M (Q + -Tj + 
D + F) = N (P + A + C + E). 

Hence, M:N::P + A + C+E:Q + B + D-fF. 



Let 1:2 

1 :2 
1 :2 



Then, 1 : 2 : : 4 -f 6 + 8 : 8 + 12 + IC), or 1 . 2 : : 18 : 30. 

It is not necessary that the first antecedent and consequent of each 
proportion should be M and N; all that is required is, that they have 
the same ratio ; for, then, we can substitute SI and N for them, and 
the above demonstration becomes applicable. To show our authority 
for this substitution, take the two proportions, 

M : N : : P : Q, and E : S : T : U. 

II T 

From the second, we get RU = ST, or — = — ; and, since, by hy- 

Pi M M T 

pothesis, TT = ^, there results — = — . Hence, M : N : : T : U. 



GEOMETRICAL PROPORTION. 101 

When we have any number of proportions, like those marlied A, 
having a common ratio, we can obviously form a continued proportion 
from them. 

Thus, M : N : : P : Q : : A : B : : C : D : : E : F. 

So, also, 1 : 2 : : 4 : 8 : : G : 12 : : 8 : 16. 

The character : : is written before each new antecedent, and refers 
it and its consequent back to the first antecedent and consequent. 

It is obvious that any antecedent may be repeated any number of 
times, provided, that its consequent is repeated the same number of 
times ; and, also, that any consequent may be multiplied or divided by 
HDything whatever, provided, that the same operation be performed on 
its consequent. 

Thus, M : N : : P + A + + P: : Q + B -f T) + F, 

may be written, 

M : N : : P + A + A + C + mE : Q + B + B + D + m¥, 
without altering the truth of the proposition. 

Thus, let 4 : 8 : 6 : 12, and 4 : 8 : : 5 : 10. 

Then, 4 : 8 : : + 5 : 12 + 10, and 4 : 8 : : 6 + 5 + o : 12 + 10 + 10. 

And also, 4 : 8 : : 6 X + 5 + 5 : 12 X 9 + Id + 10. 

Theorem XIV. 

190. If four quantities are in proportion, the sum of the first ante- 
cedent and consequent will be to their difference as the sum of the 
second antecedent and consequent is to their difference. 

For, since M : N : : P : Q, it follows that MQ = NP. 

Add NQ to both members, then Q (M + N) = X (P + Q). 

Subtract XQ from both members, then X (P — Q) = Ql — X) Q. 

Multiplying the two equations together, there results 

(M + X) (P — Q) :=. (P + Q) (M - X). 
From which we get M + X^ : M — X : : P + Q : P — Q. 
Let 2 : 6 : : 8 : 24. 

Then 2 + 6 : 2 — 6 : : 8 + 24 : 8 — 24, or 8 : — 4 : : 32 : — 16.

Theorem XV. 



191. If there are any number of proportional quantities, a single 
proportion may be formed from them by multiplying together the cor- 
responding terms of all the proportions. 

For, let M : N : : P : Q. 

A : B : : C : D. 
E : F : : a : H. 

Then, MQ = NP. 

AD = BC. 
EH = FG. 

Multiplying these equations, member by member, we get 

(MAE) (QDH) = (NBF) (PCG). 

Hence, MAE : NBF : : PCG : QDH. 

Let 1 : 2 : : 4 : 8. 

3 : 1 : : 9 : 3. 
5 : 10 : : 2 : 4. 

Then, also, 15 : 20 : : 72 : 9G. 

Theorem XVI. 

192. If four quantities are in proportion, their like powers will be 
proportional. 

For, let M : N : : P : Q. 

Then, MQ = NP. 

Squaring both members, M'^Q^ = N'P'. 

Hence, M^ : N^ : : P^ : Ql 

In like manner it may be shown that M'" : N" : : P™ : Q"". 

Let 1 : 2 : : 4 : 8. 

Then, also, 1- : 2^ : : 4" : 8^ or 1 : 4 : : 16 : 04. 

Likewise, 1= : 2^ : : 4^ : 8^ or 1 : 8 : : 64 : 51 2. 

And similar proportions can be obtained for the 4th, 5th, &c., 
powers.

General Remarlcs. 

193. All the foregoing theorems have been deduced from the first 
two ; and it is obvious that an infinite series of proportions might be 
deduced from them. The test of the truth of any proportion deduced 
directly or indirectly from the first two theorems, is the product of the 
extremes being equal to the product of the means. Thus, if 

M : N : : P : Q; then, also, M + 4 : P + 4 ^ : N : Q. 

For, by multiplying tlie extremes and means together, we have 

]MQ -f 4Q = NP + 4Q, 

which is a true equation when MQ = NP. In general, no propor- 
tion is false, however absurd it may seem, when the product of the 
extremes is equal to the product of the means. Thus, \ : x* : : x~* : 1 
is a true proportion, because the pi-oduct of the extremes is equal to 
unity, and that of the means also equal to unity. 

The proportion M : N : : P : Q, gives MQ = NP, from which we 
can get the four equations

involving eight distinct ratios. And, since ratio is the quotient arising 
from dividing one quantity by another of the same kind, we conclude, 
from the above series of equations, that either the first consequent or 
the second antecedent must represent quantities of the same kind as the 
first antecedent; and that either the first antecedent or the second 
consequent must represent quantities of the same kind as the first con- 
sequent. We also see that two distinct species of quantities, and but 
two, can be represented by a proportion. If two terms of a proportion 
are abstract numbers, the proportion can represent but one kind of 
quantity. 



104 GEOMKTRICAL PROPORTION. 

104. In tlie equation MQ = NP, resulting from the proportion 
31 : N : : P : Q, if three terms are known, it is plain that the fourth 
term can be found by solving the equation with reference to it. In 
the Single Rule of Three of Arithmetic, three terms are given to find 
the fourth. Thus, suppose the first three terms of a proportion are 3, 
4, and G. The fourth term can be found from the proportion 3:4:: 
6 : ,r. Hence 3.r = 24, or x = S, and the complete proportion is 
3 : 4 : : 6 : 8. So, likewise, let the first three terms be a, b, and c, 
then the fourth results from the proportion, a : h : : c : x. Hence, 

.(■ = — . And we see that the fourth term can be found by multiply- 
ing the second and third together, and dividing their product by the 
first. 

If the first, or either of the middle terms is unknown, we have only 
to represent the unknown term by x, form the equation from the pro- 
portion, and then solve it with reference to x. 

Let the last three terms of a proportion be a, h, and c, to find the 

first. We have, then, x : a : : b : c. Hence, x = — . 

c 

So, we see that either extreme can be found by multiplying together 

the means, and dividing their product by the other extreme. 

Let the second term be unknown, and the other three be a, b, and c. 

Then a : x : : b : c. Hence, a; = y. Let the third term be unknown, 
and the other three be a, b, and c. Then a : b : : x : c. Hence, x .— 
— . We see that either mean may be found by multiplying the ex- 
tremes together, and dividing their product by the other mean.

carried back at the rate of 12 miles per hour. Then its rate of advance 
will be expressed by 10 — ■ 12, or — 2 miles per hour. The ship will 
then plainly be carried back at the rate of 2 miles per hour, and we 
see that the minus sicn has indicated a chamre of direction. 



108 NKGATIVE QUANTITIES. 

If a man be now thirty years old. His age, four years hence, will 
be expressed by 30 + 4. Four years ago, it would have been ex- 
pressed by 30 — 4. Here, future time being positive, past time is ne- 
gative. And we sec that a change of character is again indicated by 
a change of sign. 

If a man's money and estate be represented by a, and his debts by 
h; then a — h will express what he is worth. His debts, as opposed 
to his property, are considered negative. If h be greater than a, then 
a — Z> is negative ; and we commonly say that the man is worth less 
than nothing. We see that there has been a change of sign in the 
expression for what the man was worth, corresponding to a change in 
the estimation of that worth. When the worth fell below zero, its ex- 
pression became negative, because regarded as positive when above 
zero. 

If a man agree to labor for two dollars a day, and to forfeit one 
dollar for every day that he is idle ; and he labor 4 days, and is idle 2 ; 
then his wages will ^e 4 x 2 + 2 (— 1), or 4 x 2 — 2 ( -f- 1) = 8 — 2 
dollars. We see that we have regarded as negative either the for- 
feiture, as opposed to the gain, or the working days as opposed to the 
idle. 

Distance, regarded as positive, when estimated in one direction, must 
be considered negative when estimated in a contrary direction. 

A B C 



Let a distance, AB, estimated towards the right from the point A, 
be represented by -f- m ; and let a distance, BC, estimated towards 
the right from the point B, be represented by -f ?i. 

Then, AC=:AB -f BC = TO + «. 

Now, suppose the point C be made to fall between A and B. 

AC B 



Then, AC = AB — BC = m — n . 

And we see that the expression for BC has become negative, and 
that this change of sign corresponds to a change in the direction of 
BC. It was first estimated towards the right from B; it is now esti- 
mated towards the left from B. 



NEGATIVE QUANTITIES. 10?) 

Now, suppose BC be made greater than AB, tlieii the point C will 
fall on the left of A. 

C A B_ 

And m — n, the expression for AC, will become negative. And we 
see that the expression for AC, which was positive by hypothesis when 
the distance was estimated on the right of A, has become negative 
when the distance is estimated in a contrary direction. 

197. The question now arises, as to what interpretation is to be put 
upon a negative result when it appears in the solution of a problem. 

Let it be required to find a number, which, when added to 6, will 
give a result equal to 4.* Then, from tlic conditions, we have the 
statement cc + 6 = 4. Hence, x ^= — 2. Now, the problem is 
purely arithmetical, and in arithmetic all numbers are regarded as posi- 
tive. Therefore, the solution is absurd in an arithmetical sense, but it 
is true in an algebraic sense. For substituting — 2 for a; in the equa- 
tion of the problem, we have — 2 -f 6 == 4, a true equation. The 
value satisfies the equation of the problem. It is, therefore, a true 
answer to the problem in an algebraic sense. But it is not a true 
answer to the problem as stated, for we were required to find a number, 
which, when added to 6, would give a sum ecjual to 4 ; and we have 
really found a number which, srdjfracfed from 6, gave a difference 
equal to 4. The negative solution has then satisfied the equation of 
the problem, but has failed to fulfil the conditions as enunciated. The 
explanation of this difficulty is simple, when we return to the interpre- 
tation put upon a negative quantity. We have said that a negative 
quantity always indicates a change of direction or character. That 
change must be marked by a corresponding change of condition in the 
statement of a problem, and then the negative solution will be changed 
into a positive one. The preceding problem must be changed into this : 
required to find a number, which, when subtracted from 6, will give a 
difference equal to 4. 

Then, G — ./■ = 4, and x = + 2. 

A negative solution will not, then, satisfy a problem as enunciated, 
but will be the true answer to another problem in which there has been 
a change of condition corresponding to the indicated change of charac- 
ter. But negative solutions can be best explained by the discussion of 
the " Problem of the Couriers."

110 NEGATIVE QUANTITIES. 



PROBLEM OF THE COURIERS. 

198. Two couriers travel on the same road ; the forward courier at 
the rate of h uiilcs per hour, and the rear courier at the rate of a miles 
per hour. At 12 o'clock they are separated by a distance of m miles. 
The problem is, to determine how much time will elapse before they 
are together, and also the point of meeting. 

Let the indefinite line 

A BO 



represent the road on which they are travelling ; A, the position of the 
rear courier; B, of the forward courier at 1^ o'clock; 0, the unknown 
point of meeting, and x the required time of meeting. Then, from the 
conditions of the problem, ax = AO, hx = BO, and AB =r m ; and 
since, from the figure, we have, AO — BO = AB — m, we get the 

statement, ax — hx^=m. Hence, ,r = -. The distance they 

are apart at 12 o'clock, divided by the difl"erence of their rates of travel, 
will give the number of hours that must elapse, after 12, before they 
are together. The time, multiplied by the rate of travel, a, will give 
the distance, AO, from A to the unknown point of meeting ; or the 
time, multiplied by the rate h, will give the distance, BO. If, for in- 
stance, they are separated by a distsince of 48 miles at 12 o'clock, and 
the forward courier travels at the rate of 4 miles per hour, and the rear 
courier at the rate of 6 miles per hour, then, m = 48, a = 6, and 

48 
h = 4. Hence, x = - — ^—7 = 24 hours, ax := Q . 24 = 144 miles 
b — 4 

= AO. ia; = 4 . 24 = 96 miles = BO. Verification, AB + BO 

== 48 + 96 = 144 = AO. 

We might make AO the unknown quantity, and call it )/ ; then, BO 

= y — m. Then, — , the distance the rear courier will have to travel, 

divided by his rate of travel, will give the time that must elapse before 

he will overtake the forward courier. So, ' — - — will give the time that 

the rear courier will be travelling before he is overtaken. And, since 
these are but difi"erent expressions for the same time, we get the equa- 
tion ^- = — . Hence, y = j ; and supposing, as before, that 

li a a — u

a= Q, l> = A, and ??i = 48, we have _y = AO = -r- — 7 = 144 miles. 

Then, — = --- = 24 hours, as before. 
a b 

199. We will confine our discussion mainly to the expression, .r = 

-, in which x represents the unknown time. Since the value of 

a fraction increases as its denominator decreases, it is evident tjiat, by 
making the difference between a and b very small, we can make the 
time veiy great. This is apparent, too, from the problem ; for, if the 
rear courier travel but little faster than the forward, he will gain but 
little upon him. Now, if the denominator be made the smallest possi- 
ble, the fraction will be the greatest possible. Hence, when the deno- 
minator is zero, which results from making b = a, the fraction must 
have the greatest possible value; or, in other words, an infinite value. 

Therefore, x = — = infinity, synabulizcd by the character 00 . It will 

then be an infinite time after 12 o'clock before the couriers will be to- 
gether; that is, they will never be together. This is plain, from tho 
nature of the problem ; for, if the couriers are separated by a distance 
of m miles at 12 o'clock, and travel at equal rates after 12, they must 
always keep at the same distance of m miles apart. 

The character 00 , then, indicates impossibility. "Whenever it ap- 
pears, by examining the equation of the problem, we will discover an 
absurdity arising from the hypothesis that gave the infinite result. In 
this ease, infinity was the result of the hypothesis, a = b. "When 
a = h, ax is equal to bx, or AO = BO : a part equal to the whole, 
which is absurd. 

TThe character :» , then, indicates two distinct things, viz. : impossi- 
bility in the fulfilment of the required conditions, and absurdity in the 
conditions themselves. 

200. Now, let b become greater than a, the denominator of the value 
of X becomes negative, and the whole fraction negative. "What docs 
this solution mean ? 

The sign of the time being minus, indicates that it refers to past 
time, because in the statement we regarded future time as positive. 
It is plain, also, from the nature of the problem, that the time of the 
couriers' being together, if together at all, must be past, not future. 
For the forward courier travelling more rapidly than the rear courier, 



112 N i: r. A T 1 V F, Q U A N T I T I E S . 

■will never be ovcvtr.ken by him. The solution, then, fliils to apply to 
the problem as enunciated ; but it is a true solution for another ques- 
tion, viz. : how long before 12 o'clock were the two couriers together '{ 
Lot us return to the particular problem : making h = instead of 

a = C. Then, m = 48, a = -1, h = G, and x = ^^ = — 24. 

a — h 

Now, it is obvious, that the forward courier, gaining two miles per hour 

on the rear courier, must have been with him 24 hours before 12, 

otherwise the two would not be separated by 48 miles at 12. 

_, . . . ,. cini 

Eeturning to the equation in distance, y = ■ -, we see that the 

distance, AO, also becomes negative under the hypothesis of a<^h. 
This solution indicates impossibility for a point in advance of B, be- 
cause, when a <^ h, ax is also <^ bx, or AO <^ BO, which is absurd. 
But it will be a true solution for a point in rear of A. 

A B 





Because, for such a point, the relation ax <^ bx will be true. 

Resuming the values m = 48, a = 4, and i = G, we get y = A(J 
=r — 96 miles ; which agrees with the solution above, for the courier 
A, 24 hours before 12 o'clock, being at 0, must be 96 miles from 
at 12. 

When the unknown quantity was time, we have seen that the nega- 
tive solution indicated impossibility for future time, but gave a true 
answer to the question in past time. When the unknown quantity was 
distance, the negative solution indicated impossibility for forward dis- 
tance, but gave a true answer to the question in distance estimated%iu 
the opposite direction. In general, a negative solution indicates that 
the problem, as enunciated, cannot be solved, but gives a true solution 
when the unknown quantity is changed in character or direction. 

That being the case, a negative solution may always be changed into 
a positive solution by changing the character or direction of the quan- 
tity that produced the negative result. The negative soKition, ;<: = 

-, may be changed into a positive solution in three ways. First, 

by changing the direction of the time ; that is, by changing -f x into 
— X, which is equivalent to asking, how long before 12 o'clock the two 
couriers were together. Then the equation, ax — bx= m, becomts 



NEGATIVE QUANTITIES. ll^l 



hx — aa: = m, or a:; = , a positive result, because h is greater 

b — a 

than a. Second, by changing — h into + h, which is equivalent to 

turning the forward courier around to meet the rear courier. The 

equation then becomes ./■ — j. The diagram corresponds to this ; 

for, in this case, the point O Avill be between A and B, and wo will 
have ax + 6x = AO + BO = AB. 

A B 



Third, by changing + a into — a, and — h into + h, which is equi- 
valent to turning both couriers around, and making the courier B go in 
pursuit of the courier A, the equation becomes — ax + hx = m, or 

X = , a positive result. It will be seen that the results in the 

6 — a 

first and third cases are the same, as tliey obviously (night to be. 

201. Now, let m = 0, and a > h. Then, x = — - = 0. The 

a — h 

quotient of zero by any finite quantity Ls plainly zero; for tlie numera- 
tor of a fraction indicates the amount to be divided, and the division 
of nothing must give nothing. Thus, if a man has zero dollars to di- 
vide among three persons, the share of each will plainly be nothing. 
In the present instance, the soliition, 0, shows that the couriers will be 
together at a zero time after 12; in other words, at 12 itself. This 
ought to be so; for, when m = 0, they are together at 12 ; and, since 
they travel at unequal rates, ^hey will be together no more. 

202. Now, let m = 0, and a = h. Then, x = — . To explain this 

symbol, it is necessary to notice particularly the conditions. The con- 
dition, m = 0, places the two couriers together ; the condition, a — h, 
makes them travel at equal rates. Being together at 12, and travelling 
at equal rates, they must nlways be together. They will then be to- 
gether at 1, at 2, 3, 3i, &c. There is, then, no dctenniiuUe time at 

which they are together. Hence, — is called the si/mhol of Itxhtermi- 

natlon. It does not indicate that no solution can be found, but, on the 
contrary, that too many can be determined ; and the indetermination 
consists in this, that any one of the infinite solutions will answer just 
10* II 



114 NEGATIVE QUANTITIES. 

as well as any other. Suppose, for instance, the answer to the ques- 
tion, who discovered America? was, an inhabitant of Europe some 
time after the Christian era. The answer would be indeterminate, be- 
cause equally applicable to countless millions. 

0^ 

U 

This will be a true equation, when x = 1, 10, 1000, anything what- 
ever. Hence, we say that x is indeterminate. The diagram, also, 
shows the same thing. 

A 



B 

For, when m = 0, the points A and B become the same ; and, since 
a = h, then, AO = BO in all positions of the point 0. 

Thus, it is shown in three ways that j- is the symbol of indetermi- 

nation. The symbol also arises from an identical equation ; for, when 
a = h, and vi = 0, we have ax = ax, an identical equation, in which 
X may have any value whatever. 

By recumng to the equation in y, we will observe that the distance, 
from the common point of starting to the unknown point of meeting, 
also becomes indeterminate when in = and a = h. This, obviously, 
ought to be so. 

203. There is one remarkable exception to the foregoing statement, 
that — is the symbol of indetermination. It is in the case of vanishing 

fractions. A vanishing fraction is one, which becomes — , in conse- 
quence of the existence of a common factor to the numerator and deno- 
minator, which has become zero by a particular hypothesis made upon it. 

204. Take the expression -— = = — , when m = n, but, bv de-

We conclude, that a vanishing fraction has one of three trae values; 
that it may be either finite, zero, or infinity. How, then, are wc to 

decide whether the symbol — indicates indetcrmination, or a vanishing 
fraction ? 

If the particular hypothesis which gives the symbol, does not make 

the given equation an identical equation, we may be certain that — 

points out a vanishing fraction. 

We will resume the subject of vanishing fractions more at lengt^i

will the fox make before he is caught by the greyhound ? 

Let X = number of leaps made by the fox; then, since the grey- 
hound makes but 5 leaps while the fox makes 6, he will make | cf a 
leap to one leap of the fox. Therefore, he will make |.x leaps' while 
the fox makes x leaps. But each of the greyhound's leaps are equal 
to I of a leap of the fox. Hence, the |x leaps of the greyhound are 
equivalent to | . ^x leaps of the fox ', and since the greyhound has not 
only to run over the ground passed by the fox in making x leaps, .but ,.

Ans. j: = — quarts. 

The value of x is zero when c = a. In that case, evidently, no 
water is added. The value is infinite when c = o. Then the milkman 
gives away, gratuitously, an infinite quantity of water. "When c ^ h, 
X is negative. ' Then we understai^l that a certain quantity of water is 
separated from, not added to the milk, and that the price of the milk is 
c cents per quart, and of the mixture a cents per quart.

What do these solutions become when cZ = 1 ? What, when 
hd = a? What, when bd'^ al What, when d = 1, and hd = a ? 

The first hypothesis gives a true solution. The second gives an ab- 
surd solution, as it ought, since hd can only equal a when the first 
number, after the addition of c to both numbers, exceeds the second 
proportionally as much as before. But this is impossible, since the 
smaller increases most rapidly. See Article 96. 

The hypothesis, hd, ^ (/, gives a solution impossible for arithmetical 
quantities, but possible for algebraic. We must either suppose that 
two numbers are to be found, which result from the subtraction from a 
number not expressed, or we must change the character of the problem, 
and make c subtractive. When hd = a, and r? := 1, the two numbers 
are represented by g, the symbol of indetermination. An infinite, or 
indeterminate, number of quantities will satisfy the conditions of the 
problem. 

The following problems will illustrate the foregoing cases :

ELIMINATION BETWEEN SIMULTANEOUS 
EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 

207. Simultaneous equations are those which can be satisfied for the 
same values of the same unknown quantities. Elimination can only be 
performed upon simultaneous equations. It is a process by which we 
deduce from two or more equations, containing two or more unknown 
quantities a single eqiiatiou, containing one unknown quantity. The 
single equation so found is called the final equation, and since it con- 
tains but one uiiknown quantity does not lead to arbitrary values. 
I 



130 ELIMINATION BETWEEN SIMULTANEOUS 

We will first take the simplest case, that of two equations involving 
two unknown quantities. The elimination of one of these unknown 
quantities may be effected in four ways. 

1. By Comparison. 

2. By Addition and Subtraction. 

3. By Substitution. ^ 

4. By the Greatest Common Divisor. 



ELIMINATION BY COMPARISON. 

208. Take the equations 2y = 2a; + 4, 
and 3y = 6x — 12. 

From the first we get y = .x + 2, 
and from the second, y = 'Zx — 4. 

Now, since, by hypothesis, the y and x in one equation are equal to 
the y and .r in the other equation, we can equate the values of y, and 
make the two x'& represent the same thing. Hence, a; + 2 = 2a; — 4. 
From which we get a; = 6. Solving the first equation with respect to 

y 

X, we get X = y — 2 ; and from the second we get a; = -^ + 2. 
Now, since the .r's are equal by hypothesis, we have a right to 

y 

equate their values. Hence, y — 2 = ^ +2. 

Assuming that the y's are equal in the two members of this equa- 
tion, wo have y = S. Hence, the values of x and y are x = 6, and 
y = 8. It will be seen that these values satisfy both equations. 

Elimination by comparison between two equations with two unknown 
quantities consists in solving both equations with reference to one un- 
known quantity, and equating the values so found. This eliminates 
the first unknown quantity, and gives a single equation, from which 
the value of the second can be found. The second unknown quantity 
being eliminated in like manner, the value of the first can be found. 

209. If there had been three unknown quantities, and but two equa- 
tions, there would have been, after the elimination of y, a single equa- 
tion with two unknown quantities, and the values of these two un- 
known quantities would, of course, have been arbitrary. If there had 
been two equations and but one unknown quantity, the equation could 
not, in general, be satisfied by the same value for that unknown quan- 



EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 131 

tity. The equations .r + 2 = a, and x — 2 = a, cannot be satisfied 
for the same values of x. 

We see, then, fJiat the nnniher of equations must he preciseli/ equal to 
the number of unknovni quantities. 

210. The equations have been combined under the supposition that 
they were simui^neous. If they are not so, the hypothesis has been 
absurd, and the result ought to indicate the absurdity. Take thc' 
manifestly absurd equations, 

y = 2./- + 2, 
and y = 2x — 2. 

Combining, we get 2x — 2x, or Ox = 4. Hence, x ^ ^ ^ cc. 

The absurdity of the h}^othcsis is here -oointed out by the symbol 
of absurdity. 

211. If the equations arc the same, or differ only in form, they can, 
obviously, be satisfied by an indeteriiiinate number of values for one of 
the unknown quantities, provided that of thc other is deduced after the 
substitution of the assumed value of the first. 

Take, y = 2x + 2, 

and 1/ = 2x + 2. 

Combining, we get 0^ = 0, or ^ = — . Which indicates that y may 

have any value whatever. Suppose we assume ^ = 4 ; this value for 
1/, substituted in either of the equations, will give x = 1; and the two 
values, y = 4, and x = 1, will satisfy both equations. Assuming 
arbitrary values for t/, we get an infinite number of values for x, and 
the solution becomes wholly indeterminate. 



ELIMINATION BY ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION. 
212. Resume the equations, 

2y = 2x + 4, 
and S>/ = Qx — 12, 

Multiply the first equation by 3, and thc second in like manner by 
2, and we will have 

6y = 6x + 12 

6y = 12a: — 24 

0= Qx — 36. 



132 ELIMINATION BETWEEN SIMULTANEOUS 

If tliGse equations are simultaneous, the 0// in the first equation is 
equal to the 6y in the second. And, since the x's will also be equal, 
the result of the subtraction of the equations, member bj member, will 
be = 6x — 36, or x = 6, the same value as before found. 

Now, to eliminate x in order to find the value of?/, the first equation 
must be multiplied by 3, and the second must remain as it is. 

We will get, Gj/ = 6x + 12, 

and 3;y = 6x — 12, 

and by subtraction, Zy = 24, or y = 8. 

The same value as when we eliminated by comparison. 

It will be seen that the coefficients of the unknown quantity to be 
eliminated have bees made equal in the two equations ; and, since they 
had like signs, the elimination could only be efiectcd by subtraction. 
Had these coefficients, however, been affected with contrary signs, it 
would have been necessary to add the equations member by member. 
Take as an illustration, 

2y — x = 3 

X — y =: — 1, by addition, x is eliminated. 
?/ = 2 

To eliminate y, multiply the second equation by 2, and we get 



2a; — 2y = — 2, 
and by addition, x z=.\ 

The two values are then y =^ 2, and x — 1, and these satisfy both 
equations. 

Elimination by Addition and Subtraction consists in making the 
coefficients of the unknown quantity to be eliminated the same in both 
equations, and then subti-acting the equations member by member, if 
these coefficients have like signs, or adding them member by member 
if they have unlike signs. 

It will be seen that the method of elimination by addition and sub- 
traction involves no fractions, whilst the method by comparison, in 
general, does involve fractions. To eliminate by comparison between 
the equations 

3y = a: + 2, 
and 2y = a; — 2, 

X -{- 2 X 2 

■will involve the fractions — ^ — , and — r — .

ELIMINATION BY SUBSTITUTION. 

213. This consists in finding the value of one of the unknown quan-

and substituting the value found in the second equation, so as to deter- 
mine the valueijf the second unknown quantity in known terms. 

llesume the equations, 

and 3y = Gj; — 12. 

From the first we get .y = x + 2 ; and this value of ?/, substituted 
in the second equation (since the ^'s and x's are, by hypothesis, the 
same in both equations), gives 3x + 6 = 6.t — 12. Hence, x = Q. 
In like manner, x, found from the first equation, x =■ y — 2, substi- 
tuted in the second, gives 3?/ = 6 (y — 2) — 12, or y = 8. The 
two values are then x = G, and y = S, as found by the other two 
methods. 

This process will also, in general, involve fractions. 



ELIMINATION BY THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR. 

214. This process consists in transposing all the terms of the two 
equations to the first member, and then dividing the polynomials in the 
first member by each other, as in the method of finding the greatest 
common divisor, until a remainder is found which contains but one un- 
known quantity. This remainder, placed equal to zero, constitutes the 
final equation, and the value of one of the unknown quantities can be 
deduced from it. The value of the other unknown quantity can be 
found by a similar process. 

Resume the equations, 

2y = 2x -f 4, 
and Sj^ = Qx — 12, 

transposing, 2y — 2x — 4 = 0, 

and ?>y — Qx + 12 = 0.

To eliminate x, arrange witli reference to x, and we have 

— Gx + % + 12 I — 2x + 2.y — 4 

— 6x + Cy — 12 I ^ 3 Quotient. 

— 3y + 24 = 0, or ^ = S 

It only remains to be shown the reason why the remainder is placed 
equal to zero rather than to 10, or anything else. 

Let A = represent the first equation after it has been prepared for 
division. Let B = represent the second equation. Let Q represent 
the quotient after the division of A by B, then, 

A |_B_ 
BQ Q 



A — QB = 0. 



Now, since A is zero, and B zero, A — QB is plainly zero. 

For equations of the first degree there will be but one remainder. 
But if the equations be of a higher degree th-an the first, there will be 
two or more remainders. But the same course of reasoning will show 
that each successive remainder must be zero. For the first remainder 
having been shown to equal zero, and the divisor B also equal to zero, 
the second remainder must also be equal to zero. Let B' represent the 
second remainder, and Q' the quotient resulting from the division of B 
byB'. 

Then, B |jy_ 

Q^B^ Q^ 
B — Q' B' == 0. 

Since B =: 0, and B' = 0, plainly B — Q'B' must be zero. 
The third remainder, the fourth, and so on, can, in like manner, be 
shown equal to zero. 

215. If we combine equations, which are not simultaneous, by either 
of the first three methods, the absurdity of the hypothesis is shown by 
cc, the symbol of absurdity in the result. But when we combine such 
equations by the fourth method, the absurdity appears in the final 
equation having no unknown quantity. 
Take the equations 

^ = 2x-i-2, 
and y = 2x + 4. 



EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 135 

Combining by last process, 

y — 2x — 1 1 y — 2x — 4 



— 2a; — 4 



+ 2 = 0, which, is absurd. 
21G. Though it is usual to say that the absurdity of combining equa- 
tions which are not simultaneous is shown by the final equation, yet 
we might retain the trace of one of the unknown quantities, and then 
we would still have the symbol oo. In the last example, we might 
retain the trace of y, and the final equation would be 0^ + 2 = ; 
whence y = a;. 

Rcmarlis. 

217. Of the four methods of elimination, the last is generally used 
when the degree of the second equation is higher than the first, and the 
second method (by addition and subtraction) is preferable for simple 
equations, since it does not involve fractions. Elimination by substitu- 
tion is generally associated with the other three methods after the value 
of one unknown quantity i« found ; this value is generally substituted 
in one of the given equations, and we are thus enabled to deduce that 
of the other. 

Take the equations, 

2y = 2.r + 4, 
and Zij = G.c — 12. 

From the first we have, y = s -f 2, and from the second y = 2x 
— 4. Equating the two values of y, we get x + 2 = 2x — 4. 
Hence, x = 6. This value for x, substituted in the first equation, 
gives 2y = 16, or y =: S. And substituted in the second, gives 
3/y = 24, or y = 8. Hence, the given equations are simultaneous. 
But if the substitution of the value for x in the two equations gave 
different values for y, we would conclude that the equations were not 
simultaneous. 

218. Examples in elimination heticeen two simple equations o/ the 
first degree invohiiij two xtnhioicn quantities. 

1. Find the values of x and y in the equations,

Ans. X = ;, and y = r-. 



136 ELIMINATION BETWEEN SIMULTANEOUS 

The hypothesis, a = a', makes both values infinite. The combined 
equations show that when a = a', a'h must equal ah' ; that is, unequal 
multiples of the same quantity must be equal, which is absurd. The 
equations, in fact, represent two straight lines, and the found values of 
X and y represent their point of meeting. The hypothesis, a = a',^ 
makes the lines parallel, and their point of meeting is, of course, at an 
infinite distance. 

Making a = a' and h = V, x and y both become g, or indetermi- 
nate. In this case, the two equations become identical, and can be 
satisfied by any values for x and y, as the symbol g indicates. By this 
we mean that arbitrary values may be given to either x or y, and these 
arbitrary values for one of the unknown quantities, taken in connection 
with the deduced values of the other, will satisfy both equations. 

When a = a', and b = I', the two lines coincide, and their point 
of meeting, being any where on the common line, is, of course, inde- 
terminate. 

When h = V, we will have x = 0, and y ^=l>.

219. Elimination hdioeen any numher of simidtaneoiis equations. 

The same principles govern the elimination of any number of simul- 
taneous equations as have been shown to govern the elimination be- 
tween two equations with two unknown quantities. No specific rules 
can be given for elimination, because each equation may contain all the 
unknown quantities ; or, a part only of them may contain all. It may 
be even that no equation, or but one, contains all the unknown quan- 
tities. The main thing to be observed is, to eliminate the same un- 
known quantity from all the equations that contain it. We will then 
have one unknown quantity less than before, and one equation less. 
Continue the process of elimination, until a single equation with a single 
unknown quantity is obtained. If the number of unknown quantities 
is greater than the number of equations it will be impossible to obtain 
a single equation with one unknown quantity, because the number of 
equations reduced by elimination is always eoual to the number of un- 



EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 141 

known quantities reduced. Two eliminations reduce the number of 
unknown quantities and equations by two ; three eliminations by three, 
&c. It is evident, then, that when the number of unknown quantities 
exceed the number of equations, the last equation obtained will contain 
two or more unknown quantities, and will, consequently, be an inde- 
terminate equation. 

220. If the number of equations exceed the number of unknown 
quantities, it is plain that, before all the equations have been freed 
from their unknown quantities, we will get a single equation with but 
one unknown quantity. The value of this unknown quantity then can 
be determined, and it may not be such as to satisfy all the equations. 

221. The number of equations and unknown quantities must not 
only be equal to each other, but the equations must be different in cha- 
racter, not inform merely. The equations j/ = 2x -\-2, and 2i/ = 4x 
-\- 4, differ only in form, and it is impossible to eliminate between 
them.

can now take one of these m — 1 equations, and find the value of a

quantities, and thus get m —.2 new equations, involving m — 2 un- 
known quantities. And, by continuing this process, it is plain that, 
after m — 1 eliminations, we would get a single equation, invohing a 
single unknown quantity, and, therefore, would be able to find the 
value of that unknown quantity. But, if we have m equations, involv- 
ing m -\-h unknown quantities, we can only make m — 1 svibstitutions, 
and then we will have a single equation, involving h -\- 1 unknown 
quantities. If Z* = 1, the final equation will contain two unknown 
quantities, and bo of the form x + i/ = 10, an indeterminate equation, 
in which the value of x can only be found by attributing arbitrary 
values to I/. HI) z= 2, the final equation v,'ill contain three unknown 
quantities, and be of the form of cc -f y + s = 10 ; in which x can 
only be determined by giving arbitrary values both to y and z. It is 
plain, then, that when the number of unknown quantities exceed the 
number of equations, the elimination will lead to indetermination. 

223. If, on the contrary, we have m -\- h equations, involving m 
unknown quantities, m of these equations are suificient to determine 
the m unknown quantities. The remaining h equations might, or 
might not, be satisfied by the values found from the m equations. If 
the I equations are satisfied, they are not independent equations ; if they 
are not satisfied, they are contradictory equations. Thus, x = 2, and 



EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 147 

2xz=4: are satisfied by the same value of x ; but the second equation 
is not an independent equation, since it differs only in form from the 
first, a; = 2, and a; = 3 are contradictory equations. We conclude, 
then, in general, that the number of independent equations must be 
precisely equal to the number of unknown quantities. 

224. An artifice sometimes enables us to eliminate between a num- 
ber of equations more readily than by the usual direct process. As an 
illustration take the equations, 

X + y = 5, 

X -{- z = Q, 

z +y = 7. 

Let s = x -{■ 7/ -{- ::. The three equations then become 
s — z = b 

s — X = 7 

Adding, we get 3s — (x -|- y + ~) = 18. But, since x + 1/ -\- z 
= s, we have 2s := 18, or s = d. This, substituted in equations 
marked A, gives 2i= 4, y = 3, and x = 2. 
Take, as a second illustration, 

xi/ -\- xz = 27, 
7/z-{-y + z = 29, 
xyz = GO. 

27 

By factoring and solving the first equation, we get y + 2 = — . 

27 

This, substituted in the second, gives ys + — =: 29. But from the 

third equation we find yz = — . Hence, f- — = 29, from which 

27 
x = ^. Then, y + ^ = — = 9, and xyz = GO, or yz = 20. Elimi- 
nating, we get z- — dz + 20 == 0, or s« — 10^ + 25 + s — 5 = 0, or 
(z — by + z — b = 0, or (s — 5) (2 — 5 + 1) = 0. Dividing out 
the second factor, we have left z — 5 = 0, or z=zb, from which 
y = 4. 

Take another illustration, 

xy + xz = \2 (1), 

y^-f^=rl08 (2), 

s — X = 8 (3). 



148 ELIMINATION BETWEEN SIBIULTANEOUS 

Subtracting (1) from (2), we get y {z — j-) -\- z {z — x) == 96, or 
(z — X) {y + 2:)=r96 (4). Dividing (4) by (3), member by mem- 
ber, we got y -\- z = 12 (5). Equation (2) may be put under tlie 
form of z (?/ + z) = 108. Dividing this, member by member, by (5), 
we will have 2 = 9. Equation (1), put under tlie form of x (y -^ z) 
=z 12, divided by (5), gives x = 1. The value of z substituted in 
(5), gives 2/ = 3- Hence, x = 1, ?/ = 3, and z = 9. 



PROBLEMS PRODUCING SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS OF THE 
FIRST DEGREE. 

225. Many of the problems already given (Arts. 176 and 206) could 
have been solved as readily, or more readily, with two unknown quan- 
tities ; and there are many problems wliich can only be solved by the 
use of two or more unknown quantities. 

We will solve three of the problems already given, to show the man- 
ner of using two unknown quantities. 

1. The sum of two numbers is a, and their difference I, what are 
the numbers ? 

Let X = greater number, and y = smaller. Then, by the condi- 
tion of the problem, x + y = a, and x — y =zlj. Eliminating y by 

adding the two equations member by member, we^ get a; = — -|- — . 

Eliminating x by subtracting the equations member by member, we 

have ?/ = — -. So, we see that when we know the sum and diffe- 

2 2 

rence of two quantities, we get the greater by adding the half difference 

to the half sum, and the less by subtracting the half difference from 

the half sum. 

Thus, the sum of two numbers is 20, and their difference 10 ; the 

greater is, by the formula, 15, and the smaller 5. 

2. A fox is 125 of his own leaps ahead of a greyhound, and makes 
6 leaps to the greyhound's 5 ; but two leaps of the greyhound are 
equivalent to 3 leaps of the fox. How many leaps will the fox take 
before he is overtaken by the greyhound ? 

Let X = distance passed over by the fox, counted in terms of his 
own leaps. Let y = distance passed by the greyhound. Then these 
distances would be proportional to the relative number of leaps taken 
by the fox and gi'cyhound, if their leaps were equal in length. And 



EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 149 

we would have x, y : : 6 : 5. But since each leap of the greyhound is 
equivalent to | leaps of the fox, the 5 leaps of the greyhound are equi- 
valent to 5 . I = ij^ leaps of the fox. Hence, x : y : : Q : L^, and 
the distance, y, passed by the greyhound, will be expressed in terms 

5x 
of the leaps of the fox. From the proportion we get y = —, and from 

the condition of the problem, y — x = 125. Combining, we get 
X = 500, and y = 625 leaps of the fox. 

It will be readily seen that this solution has some advantages over 
that with one unknown quantity. 

3. Two couriers start from different points on the same road, and 
travel in the same direction. The forward courier travels at the rate 
of b miles per hour, and the rear courier at the rate of a miles per 
hour. They were separated by a distance of m miles at starting. 
How long will it be until they come together ? 

Let X = distance travelled by forward courier, y = distance tra- 
velled by the rear courier. Then, since the distances travelled must be 
proportional to the rates of travel, we will have x : y : : h : a, or by 
= ax. From the conditions of the problem, we have y — xz=m; 

combining, we get x = r, and y = -,. These di.stances, di- 

u — (/ u — o 

vided by the rate of travel, will, of course, give the time elapsed before 

their junction. Both expressions give for the time, as found, 

a — b 

when one unknown quantity was used. This solution, compared with 

the preceding, shows how much the use of two unknown quantities 

has shortened the work.

VANISHING FRACTIONS. 

The symbol g has been interpreted to sitrnify iudctermiiiation, and 

this is the true interpretation for solutions of equations of the first 

degree, when the symbol proceeds from two suppositions, made either 

upon the values found, or upon the equation of the problem. But the 

symbol may arise from a single hypothesis, and then it always indicates, 

not indctermination, but the existence of a common factor.

Take the expression, —, which becomes g whcn=j: — y. But, 

X y 

by factoring the numerator, we have — = ^-'-A- — -^'2 __

X + y ^= 2y, when x =zy. The true value of g in the present in- 
stance is 2y, as shown by removing the common factor, x — ?/. Again,

take the expression -, = — when x = y. But —, ~ =

(x — y){x-i-y) x-^y -ly 

the vanishing fraction is again shown to be finite. But, take -^- —. 

(•*: — y) 

= J- when x = y. Factoring, we get -, — ^ . = = — , 

or Qo when x = y. And the true value of the vanishing fraction in the 

(x yf 

present instance is infinity. Take again, ^— = — when x = y. 

Factoring, we get — — — — ^^^ — z=i x — y = when x = y. So, 

we see, that when there is a common factor existing between the nu- 
merator and denominator of a fraction, which factor has become zero^ 
the fraction may have either of three values, finity, infinity, or zero. 

To show it more generally, take the expression -~ = — when 

Q {x — (/)" 

x = a. There may be three cases, m may be = n, <^ n, or ^ n.

P

fraction becomes /r- ^ , which is infinite, when x =z a. In the 

third case, when m ^ n, dividing by (x — o)", the fraction becomes 

Y (x a)""" 

— ^^ — = when X = a. And as we have taken a general ex- 

Q 

pression, we conclude, in general, that a vanishing fraction is one 

which assumes the form of g, in consequence of the existence of a 

common factor, which has become zero by a particular hypothesis, 

and that the true value of the fraction may be either finite, infinite, or 

zero. 

227. When the common factor is apparent, we have only to strike it 
out before making our hypothesis, and we get at once the true value 
of the fraction. But there are many expressions, in which it is diffi- 
cult to detect the common factor, and it then becomes necessary to 
know a process by which the common factor may be discovered. We 
will illustrate the process by a simple example, in which the common 

X^ ft2 

factor is apparent. Take the expression, =: — when x = a. 

X — a 

Here, the assumed value of x is a. If, however, we make x = a -{■ h, 

and substitute this value for x in both terms of the fraction, reduce the 

result to its lowest form, and then make h = 0, it is evident that we 

will have done nothing more than attribute to x the value a. Making 

,1 , ,., ,. , «' + 2ah + li' — a" 2ali + A' „ 

the substitution, we get ; = r i=z2a -{-Ji^

- is then 2a, 
when X =za. 

As the same process is plainly applicable to all fractions in which 
the terms are affected with iiumerical exponents, we derive for such 
fractions the general 

RULE. 

Adrihufe to (hat term vpon which the hypothesis is made the value

the result to its lowest form and then make h = 0.

In the above example, x is tlie term upon which the hypothesis is 
made, and a the value which reduces the fraction to the form of g 
Hence, by the rule, x =:a + h.

162 YANISIIlNCi FRACTIONS. 

The two last results arise from the fact of the given fraction being 
a double vanishing fraction. It can be put under the form of 

^ , ^ ^' , , which is a vanishing fraction, when either o: = h, 

(x — b) (x — a) 

or a; = n. 

229. It is obvious, in all these examples, that x, minus the value of 
X, which makes the fraction assume the form of ^, is the common fac- 
tor. If we, then, divide both terms of the fraction by this common 
factor, and then attribute the appropriate value to x, we will have the 
true value of the vanishing fraction. But there are many expressions 
for which this rule fails, as will be seen more fully hereafter. 

Since it is often difficult, if not impossible, without the aid of the 
differential calculus, to ascertain the existence of a common factor, if 
there be one, it becomes important to have a simple test by which we 
can tell whether £ indicates indctcrmination or a vanishing fraction. 

Take the fraction tt— ^^ ^, which becomes [{ by the single hypo- 

Q(.c — a)"' 

thesis x = a. It is evident that the expression is a vanishing fraction, 

and that the common factor is some power of x — a. But take the 

'P (x a)"' 

fraction —j r^-, which becomes Q by the double hypothesis x = a, 

vj (X Uj 

and x = h. It is plain that the expression cannot be a single vanish- 
ing fraction like those exhibited in the first six examples ; and if it is 
a double vanishing fraction of the form exhibited in Examples 7 and 8, 
it cannot be a true solution to a problem of the first degree, since x 
cannot have two values. We then conclude, that when g arises from a 
single hypothesis upon a solution of an equation of the first degree, it 
indicates the existence of a common factor. But, if it arises from 
two suppositions, it indicates indetermination. In conformity to this 
rule, we have interpreted §, in the problem of the couriers, to indicate 
indetermination, because the symbol proceeded from the double hypo- 
thesis, VI =: 0, and a :=b. 



POWERS AND EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 163 

FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 
EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 

230. The power of a quantity is the result obtained by multiplying 
it by itself any number of times. 

Any quantity is the first power of itself. 

If a quantity be multiplied by itself once, or enters twice as a factor 
iu the result, the result is called the second power of the quantity. 
Thus, 2.2= 2!^, or 4, and a . a =a^, are the second powers of 2 
and a. 

If a quantity be multii^lied by itself twice, three times, four times, 
&c., or enters into the result as a factor three times, four times, &c., 
the result is called the third power, the fourth power, &c., of the quan- 
tity. In general, the number of multiplications of the quantity by 
itself is one less than tht^quantity which designates the power, and the 
number of times that the quantity enters as a factor in the result, is 
precisely equal to that quantity. 

The quantity which designates the power is called the exponent of 
the power, and is written a little above and to the right of the given 
quantity. 

Thus, 2* = 4 is the second power or square of 2. 
2' = 8 is the third power or cube of 2. 
2* = 16 is the fourth power of 2. 
ay is the ?/ power of a, 

and indicates that a has been multiplied by itself y — 1 times, or that 
a enters as a factor y times in the expression o>. 

When no exponent is written, the first power is always understood. 
Thus, 2 = 2', and a + i = (a + i)'. 

The quantity to be raised to a power may be expressed numerically, 
or by letters, and may be entire or fractional, positive or negative. 
And, since the power in every case is a product, we may define the 
formation of a power, to consist in finding the product arising from 
multiplying the quantity, by itself, a number of times one less then 
that indicated by the exponent of the power. 

The poxcer differs from an ordinart/ prodxtcf, then, in this essential 
■particular, all the factors of the power are equal. 



1G4 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

231. The root of a quantity is tliat quantity which, multiplied by 
itself a certain number of times, will produce the given quantity. 

When a quantity, multiplied by itself once, or taken as a factor 
twice, gives the given quantity; it is called the square root of the 
given quantity. Thus, 2 is the square root of 4, because 2.2 = 4; 
and a is the square root of a^, because a . a ^= a^. 

Raising quantities to powers is called Involution. 

Extracting the roots of quantities is called Evolution. 

Involution deals in equal factors. Evolution finds one of those equal 
factors. t 

232. Involution is a simple process. Evolution is more difiicult, 
and requires particular explanation. "We will begin with the simplest 
form of evolution, the extraction of the square root of whole numbers, 
which is nothing more than evolving one of the equal factors out of the 
product of two equal factors. 

It is evident that evolution is the reverse of involution, and that we 
cannot extract any root without knowing how the powers of that root 
are formed. To demonstrate the rule, then, for the extraction of the 
square root of whole numbers, we must first examine and see how the 
square power of whole numbers is formed. 

233. The first ten numbers are 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
And their squares are 

1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100. 

Reciprocally, the numbers of the first line are the square roots of the 
corresponding numbers in the second line. We see, also, that the 
square of any number below 10 is expressed by not more than two 
figures. That is, the square of units cannot give a higher denomina- 
tion than tens. So, likewise, it may be shown that the square of tens 
cannot give a higher denomination than thousands, since the square of 
99 is 9801. 

The numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, &c., and all the other numbers produced 
by the multiplication of a number by itself, are called pcr/t'c^ squares. 

We see that there are but nine perfect squares between 1 and 100. 
The square roots of all numbers lying between 1 and 100 will be found 
between the consecutive roots of two perfect squares. Thus, the square 
root of 20 lies between the consecutive roots 4 and 5, being greater 
than the former, and less than the latter. The square root of 26 lies 
between the consecutive roots 5 and 6. 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 165 

The square root of all numbers below 10,000 may be regarded as 
made up of tens and units. Thus, 99, the square root of 9801, is 
made up of 9 tens and 9 units. The number 32 is made up of 3 tens 
and 2 units. We have seen that the square of a number containing 
two figures could not give a higher denomination than thousands ; con- 
versely, the square root of thousands cannot give a number containing 
more than two figures ; that is, a number containing tens and units. 

284. If, then, we have to extract the square root of a number con- 
taining more than three figures, and less than five, we know that its 
root must contain two figures, and, therefore, be made up of tens and 
units. Before we can deduce a rule for the extraction of the root of 
thousands, we must know how thousands are derived from squaring 
tens and units. 

Let a represent the tens, and b the units, which enter into the square 
root of thousands. Then, (a + by = a^ + 2ah + V^. Hence, thou- 
sands arc made up of the square of the tens that enter into its root, 
plus the square of the units, plus the double product of the tens by the 
units. 

Let us square the number 34, made up of 3 tens and 4 units, = 30 
4- 4. Then, 30 corresponds to a in the formula, and h correspond.s 
to 4. 

Hence, a^ = (30^) = 900, 

2rti = 2 . 30 . 4 = 240, 
b' = (4f = 16, 

Then, (34)^ = a' -f 2ab + U' = 1156. 

235. If we were required to extract the square root of this number, 
we would have to revei*se the process, and first take out a*, then, 2ah 
and Z)l 

The number, 1150, belonging to the denomination of thousands, its 
root must contain tons and units, and 
we must first get out the tens by 
extracting the square root of the 
square of the tens ; that is, the s/ «^- 
Now, the square of tens will give 2a -\- b 
at least three figures, therefore the 60 -f- 4 
root of the tens cannot be sought in 
the two right hand figures, and we, 
therefore, separate them from the 
others by a dot, and the given number is then separated into what are

16G FOR-MATION OF THE TOAVERS AND 

called pcrtoih of two figures each. The square of 30 is 900, and the 
square of 40 is 1600. The number, 115G, falling between 900 and 
1600, its root must contain 3 tens plus a certain number of units. We 
then extract the greatest square contained in the left hand period, 1100, 
and set the root, 30, on the right, after the manner of a quotient in 
division. We have now found a, square it, and subtract a^ or 900, 
from 1156, and the remainder must be 2oi + 1'^: in the present instance 
equal to 256. The remainder, 2ah + 1j\ can be written (2a + l)h; 
and it is evident that, to find h accurately, we must divide by (2a + h). 
But, as the term h within the parenthesis is unknown, we are com- 
pelled to use 2a as the aj)proximate divisor. We write 2a, or 60, on 
the left as a divisor, and divide 256 by it, and set the quotient h, or 4, 
on the right of the root found, and also on the right of the divisor. 
Now, multiply the two terms on the left, 2a -f J, or 60 + 4 by Z» or 4, 
and we evidently form 2a^ + ?/, the parts entering into the remainder, 
256. Subtracting the two products thus formed from 256, we find no 
remainder. Hence, 34 is the exact root of 1156. 

We have separated the tens from 
the units, to let the beginner see that 
he is really taking a^ -}- 2ah + 1/ in 
succession, out of the given number, 
2a + h \ 2 56 = 2a6 + V^ 1156. But we might have indicated 
6 4 I 2 56 = 2ah + V their separation by a point above, and 
written 3 4, instead of 30 + 4, and 
6 4 instead of 60 + 4. When the beginner is familiar with the princi- 
ples, he may omit the dots, -which are intended to guard him against 
confounding the tens with the units. He must observe, however, that 
this divisor being the double product of tens, is, itself, tens, and, there- 
fore, if written out in full, would contain a cj'pher on its right. And 
since, in dividing by a number whose right hand figure is 0, we point 
ofi" that figure from the right of the divisor, and also point oif the right 
hand figure of the dividend, we must be careful to do this in dividing 
by the double product of the tens. In the present instance, the right ' 
hand figure, 6, of the remainder 256, must be separated from the other 
two figures, since, in using 6 as the divisor instead of 60, we have, in 
fact, pointed off from the right of the divisor. 

236. -There is one point of considerable importance that needs some 
examination. In getting the second figure of the root, we used 2a as

EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 167 

whereas, the true divisor, to find h, is plaiuly 2a + h. Our divisor 
being too small, the quotient, which is the second figure of the root, 
can never be too small, but may be too great. It is plain that, when h, 
in the expression (2a + h), is very small in comparison with '2a, it 
may be neglected. But b may be so large that the omission of it 
will give too great a quotient. The square of 35 is 1225 ; the square 
root of 1225 is then, of course, 35. Now, if we proceed to extract 
the square root of 1225, the remainder, after taking out a", or 900, 
will be found to be 325 = 2ah -\- V = 300 + 25. And we sec that 
the square of the units has added 2 tens to 'lah, the double product of 
the tens by the units. When, therefore, we point off 5 from the right 
of 32 5, and divide 32 by 6, it is plain that the dividend, which ought 
to be 2ah (if the divisor is 2a), is too great by 2 tens. The quo- 
tient, then, would be too great, if the 2 tens added were divisible by 
the divisor. Then the second figure of the root would be augmented 
improperly by the quotient, arising from dividing the 2 tens impro- 
perly added by G, or 2a. In the present case, however, if we omit the 
2 tens, and divide 30 by G, we get the same quotient, 5, as when the 2 
tens are retained; their addition has not, then, affected the result. 

But, square 19, and we get 3G1. 
In this case, h, in the expression 
(2a -f 6), is not small in comparison 
with 2a, and cannot, therefore, be 
neglected without affecting the re- 
sult. Now, if we use 2a as the 
divisor of the remainder, 2ai -f W, 
to find h, we ought to use lah alone 
as the dividend; and, therefore, if 

we use the whole of the expression, 2ah -\- V, our dividend is too great. 
Dividing 26 by 2, the quotient is 13, which is plainly absurd for the 
units of the root. But, we see that 180, or lah, ought to have been 
the dividend corresponding to 20, or 2a, as a divisor. The 26 tens is 
then too great by 8 tens ; and, since the 8 tens added, give 4 for a 
quotient when divided by the 2 tens of the divisor; the second figure 
of the root is too great by 4, and we must write 9 as that figure, and 
not 13. The 8 additional tens in the 2G tens come from the square of 
the units, and being divisible by the divisor, 2a, have improperly aug- 
mented the second figure of the root. Had the 8 tens not been divisible 
by 2rt, the second figure of the root would not have been increased at 
all, and the quotient of lah -\- W by 2a would have truly been the

168 FORMATION OP THE POWERS AND 

second figure of the root. In general, whenever the square of the units 
(i^) incorporate into the remainder, 2ab + Z;'^, tens which are exactly 
divisible by 2a, the divisor, the second figure of the root will be too 
great, and must be diminished by the quotient of the incorporated tens 
by the 2a of the divisor. 

237. The foregoing course of reasoning has shown that the second 
figure of the root may be too great, and the cause of its being too great; 
but, since the units of the root are unknown, the number of the tens 
proceeding from their square, that are incorporated with 2ah, cannot 
be known. We must, then, in practice, form the product of 2a + 5 
on the left by the second figure, I, of the root, and compare the result 
with the remainder. If the product is greater than the remainder, the 
second figure must be diminished until the product is equal to the re- 
mainder, or smaller than it. If the given number is an exact square, 
its root will be exact, and the product will be exactly equal to the re- 
mainder. When the root is not exact, the product must be made less 
than the remainder. 

The preceding principles enable us to deduce for the extraction of 
the square root of whole numbers, embraced between 100 and 10,000, 
the following 

RULE. 

I. Separate the two rigid hand figures from the other figxires or 
figure of the given numher, and find the greatest square contained in 
the left hand period, which may contain hut one figure. 

II. Set the root of this greatest sq%iare on the right, after the manner 
of a quotient in division. Sichtract the square of the root thus found 
from the first period, and annex the second period to the remainder. 

III. Double the root found and place it on the left for a divisor. 
Seek how often the divisor is contained in the remainder, exclusive of 
the right hand fig%ire, and place the quotient on the right of the root 
already found, separated from it hy a dot above. Place it also on the 
right of the divisor, separated from it in like manner. 

IV. Midtiply the divisor thus augmented by the second figure of the 
root, and suhtract the product from the first remainder. If there is no 
remainder, the root is exact. Jf the product exceed the first remainder, 
the second figure of the root must be diminislied until the product is 
equal to or smaller than the first remainder.

10. Extract the square root of 7056. Ans.- 84. 

238. We have seen that the second figure of the root has frequently 
to be diminished. We may diminish it too much, and it becomes ne- 
cessary to know when we have made the second figure too small. The 
test of this depends upon the principle, that the difference between two 
consecutive squares is equal to twice the smaller number plus unity. 

Let a =. smaller number. 

Then, a + 1 = consecutive number, or the number just above a. 

And (a + 1)^ = a^ + 2a + 1. 

Their difference is 2a -j- 1, as enunciated. 

Now, when there is a remainder, after finding the second figure of 
the root, and subtracting the product of it by the quantity on the left 
from the first remainder, it is evident tbat the second remainder ex- 
presses the excess of the given number, which we may regard as 
(a 4- l)'^, over the square of the two figures found. If, then, the 
second remainder be exactly twice the root found plus unity, it is evi- 
dent that the root found is o, and that the second figure of the root can 
be increased by unity. 

To illustrate, suppose 6 to be the square root of 49, (a -{- 1)^ 

then the remainder being equal to twice the root found 49 I a 

plus unity, the root can be increased by unity. In 36 = a^ I 6 
general, whenever the remainder exceeds twice the 1 ." — 2a -j- 1 
root found plus unity, the root can be augmented by 
unity. If the remainder is exactly equal to twice the root found plus

170 FORMATION OP THE POWKRS AND 

unity, the root, increased by unity, will be the exact root of the given 
number. 

239. This rule is of importance in finding the square root of imper- 

fect squares. Let it be required to find the square root 

1 5G 1 12 of 156. We find a remainder 12, and a root 12. Is 

1 12 the greatest root contained in 156 ? Is the root 12 

22 I 56 plus a remainder, or 13 plus a remainder? By the 

44 principle just demonstrated, the true root of 156 must 

12 be 12 plus a remainder, because the second remainder 

is not double the whole root found, plus unity. 

240. This principle also enables us to pass from the square of a 
number to the square of a consecutive number without raising the 
second number to the square power. We have only to represent the 
smaller number by a, then the consecutive number will be a + 1, and 
its square must exceed a? by 2a + 1. 

Thus, (100)=^ =r a^ = 10000. 

a^ (2a + 1) 
Then, (101)^ == (a + 1)' = 10000 -}- 200 + 1 == 10201. 

(a + 1)^ a^ (2a + 1) 

So, also, (102)-^ = (101 + If = 10201 + 202 + 1 = 10404.

241. If we square any number, as 12 and 55, containing two figures, 
and made up then of tens and units, the square will contain two periods, 
counting from the right, and it is plain that the tens can only be 
sought in the periods on the left. If we square a number made up of 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 171 

hundreds, tens, and units, the square 'will contain three periods, and 
the hundreds can only be found in the left hand period, and the tens 
only in the second period, annexed to what is left of the first periods 
after the square of the hundreds has been taken from it. In general, 
the number of periods in the given number always indicate the number 
of figure places in the root, and each figure of the root has its appro- 
priate period or periods. 

The principles that have been demonstrated for the extraction of the 
square root of numbers between 100 and 10,000 can readily be ex- 
tended to any numbers whatever. Let a represent the highest denomi- 
nation in the root, and s all the succeeding denominations in the root. 
Then the number itself will be expressed by (a -f s)- = o? -\- 2as -\- s^, 
an analogous expression to (« + by = a- -j- 2ah + I/, and differing 
only in its more general significance. The a in one formula is not re- 
stricted to represent tens, as it is in the other, but may represent hun- 
dreds, thousands, millions, &c. j and the s of the first formula is not 
restricted to represent units only, but may represent tens and units, 
hundreds, tens, and units, &c. 

Let us square 155 by means of the formula. 

Then, a = 100, and s = 55. 

a' = (100)- = 10000, 
2as = 200'55 =11000, 
s' =(55/ = 3025, 

Hence, (155)^ = 24025 

We see from the formula that a, it matters not what may be its de- 
nomination, must first be found; and, that after its square has been 
subtracted from the given number, the remaiiuler will be 2t(H -f s" = 
(2a + s)s. 

The number, 24025, being greater than lOOOO, its root will be 
greater than 100, and, therefore, a- 

canuot be found in the two right «" + 2('s + s^ 

hand periods. We seek it in the 2 40 25 | a + s 

period on the left, and after placing 1 00 00 I 1 55 

it on the right, and subtracting its 2a -f s I 1 40 25 = 2as + 0^ 
square from the given number, have 255 I 1 11 00 = 2as 
14025 for a remainder. We cut off 30 25 = s' 

the right hand figures, because 2, the 00 00 Remainder, 

approximate divisor, is really 200; 
and, after trial, we find 55 to be the right hand figures of the root. 



172 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

The 55 is set on the right of the root ah-eady found, and also on the 
right of the divisor. The product of 255 by 55 is 14025, and there 
is, consequently, no second remainder, and the root is exact. 

2-42. The approximate divisor is always large for numbers above 
10000, and s can only be found by repeated trials. But the above 
process can be greatly simplified by observing that, since 2a enters 
into s, representing several denominations, it must enter into each de- 
nomination separately. Thus, in the foregoing example, 2a, or 2, 
being a multiplier of 55, is a multiplier of the first 5, regarded as 5 
tens, or 50, and of the second 5, regarded as units. We might, then, 
have found the 5 tens and the 5 units, separately taking care to write 
the one after the other, so as to make their denomination distinct. In 
the present example, 2as being equal to 2 . 55, is, of course, equal to 
2 (^50 + 5) J s may be regarded as a single term, 55, to be found at 
once, or it may be regarded as made up of 50 and 5, separate terms, to 
be found separately. But, if the second and third figure of the root be 
found separately as independent numbers, they must be sought for in 
their appropriate periods. It will simplify the work when we proceed 
in this manner to subtract the square of a from the left hand period, 
and bring down each term in succession. In this case, since we make 
two terms of s, let s ^ s' -f s" . Then the root will be a + s" -f s", 
and the number will be (a + s" + s")^, which, by performing the mul- 
tiplication indicated, will give us a^ + 2os' -f- s'^ -f- 2as" + 2sV' + s"^ 
= a" + 2as' + s'^ + 2 {a + s') s" + i>"\ When we subtract o^ from 

the left hand period, 
we have, in fact, 
subtracted 10000 
from the given num- 
ber. After the se- 
cond period has 
been annexed to 
the remainder, the 
140 truly represents 
14000, and, since 
the zero, on the right of 140, belongs to the denomination of hundreds, 
it must be separated from the 14 when we come to seek for the tens of 
the root, because /, the tens, is sought for in 2as' by using 2a as the 
approximate divisor. Now, 2as' must be at least thousands, and, 
therefore, the denomination of hundreds does not contain s'. We write 
s, when found, on the right of the first term of the root and also on 



2a + s'

the right of the divisor. Multiplying the divisor thus augmented by 
s' in the root, and subtracting the product from the first remainder, we 
will plainly have left, after annexing the next period, 2 (a -f s').s"+ s"^. 
And we see that the approximate divisor to find s" is 2 (a + s'). The 
whole root already found mu.st then be doubled and used as our approxi- 
mate divisor. The right hand figure of 1525 is cut off, because 
2 (a + s')s" gives at least hundreds. After s" is found, we multiply 
'1 (a -\- s') by it, and have no remainder; the root is then exact. We 
have used the broken line, in the above example, after each minuend 
and subtrahend to indicate that there were other numbers to follow 
them.

If wc have a number made up of 4 periods, as 2 98 59 84, we know 
that its root must contain 4 figure places, which may be represented by 
a, s', ,s", and s'". And the given number must then be equal to 
(a 4- s' + s" + s'")^ = a"" + 2as' + s" + 2 (a + s')s"+ s"^ + 2 (a+sf 

We sec, then, that 2a is the approximate divisor to find .s', the 
second figure of the root ; (2a + s') the approxim-ate divisor to find s", 
the third figure of the root; and (2(a-\-sf) + s") the approximate di- 
visor to find s'", the units of the roots. In other words, we see that 
the whole root found has to be doubled to find each figure of the root 
succeeding those already found. It is evident, too, that the right hand 
figure of each of the successive remainders must be cut off previous to 
dividing by 2a, 2 (a + s'), &c., because in all these remainders that 
figure is of too low a denomination to make any part of the product of 
the figure of the root sought by the approximate divisor. Thus, 
8, which belongs to the denomination of tens of thousands, cannot 
be a part of the product arising from multiplying 2a, or 2000, by s', 
which is hundreds. This product must give at least hundreds of 
thousands.

174 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

243. It is plain tliat^ from the manner in which tlie square of any 
number of terms is formed, the foregoing demonstrations for numbers 
having two, three, and four periods are general ; and we, therefore, have 
for the extraction of the square root of any number whatever, the 
general 



I. SejxtJ'ate the given number into periods of two figures each, begin- 
ning on the right; the left hand period may contain but one figure. 

II. Find the greatest square contained in the left hand period, and 
set its root on the right, after the maimer of a qxiotient in division. 
Subtract the square of the root found from the left hand period, and to 
the remainder annex the second period, and use the number tints found 
as a dividend. 

III. Doidjle the root found and p>^(-^ce it on the left for a divisor. 
Seek how often the divisor is contained in the dividend exclusive of 
the right hand figure, and place the qtiotient on the right of the root 
already found, and separate the two figures by a point. Set the quo- 
tient also on the right of the divisor and separate in like manner. 

IV. Multiply the divisor thus increased by the second figure of the 
root, subtract the product from the dividend, and to the remainder 
annex the second period of the given number. Use the remainder and 
annexed period as a new dividend. 

V. Double the whole root found for a new divisor, and continue the 
operation as before until all the periods are brought down. 

Remarks. 

244. If the last remainder is zero, the given number is a perfect 
square. But, if the remainder is not equal to zero, we have only found 
the entire part of the root sought, and the given number is incommen- 
surable. 

245. If we take 155, the square root of 24025, we observe that 15 
has been derived from the two left hand periods. We might, then, 
after finding 5, have squared 15, and subtracted its square from 240. 
So, after finding the last 5 of the root, we have subtracted the square 
of 155 from the three given periods. In general, when we have found 
two figures of the root, or three figures, or four figures, &c., we may 
subtract their square from the two left hand periods, or the three left 
hand periods, &c.

OF INCOMMENSURABLE NUMBERS. 

246. An incommensurable number is one whose indicated root can- 
not be exactly extracted. Thus, the \/2, V8, and \/27 are incom- 
mensurable numbers. Such numbers are also called irrational num- 
bers, ajid sometimes surds. 

We have indicated (Art. 240,) that the roots of imperfect square 
powers were not complete by writing the sign + after the entire parts 
of those roots. So we may write the -v/ 5 := 2 -f . The number 5 
lying between 4 and 9, the square roots of which are 2 and 3, its own 
root will be greater than 2, and less than 8. May not this root, then, 
be expressed by some fraction whose value is greater than 2, and less 
than 3, such as |, or | ? May not the roots of all imperfect square 
powers be expressed by vulgar fractions in exact parts of unity ? 

To prove that this cannot be, we will demonstrate a theorem upon 
which depends the proof of its absurdity. 

Theorem. 

247. Every number^ P, which will exactly divide the product, 
A X B, of two numbers, and which is prime with respect to one of 
them, will divide the other. 



176 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

Let A be the number with which P is prime. Let Q be the qua 
tieut arising from dividing AB by P, then -t— - = Q. We may put 

this equation under the form A X ^tj = Q. Now, Q is, by hypothesis, 

an entire number; the second member being a whole number, the first 
member must also be a whole number, else we would have an irreduci- 
ble fraction equal to a whole number, which is absurd. The product 

of A into r— has then to be entire ; now, A itself, is entire and prime 

T) 

with respect to P, hence, — must also be entire. For a whole number, 

multiplied by a fraction, can only give an entire product when the 
whole number is divisible by the denominator of the fractfon into which 
it is multiplied. Thus 4, a whole number, multiplied by the fraction 
#, gives an entire product, because 4 is divisible by 2. But 5 into | 
does not give an entire product, because 5 is not divisible by 2. Now, 
the whole number A is, by hypothesis, not divisible by the denomina- 

B B 

tor, P, of the expression p- ; the product of A by ^15- cannot, then, pos- 
sibly be equal to the whole number, Q, unless B is divisible by P. 

248. We are now prepared to show that the square root of an im- 
perfect square, such as 5, cannot be expressed by a fraction. If the 

root of 5 can be expressed by a fraction, let — be that fraction, a being 

greater than h, and prime with respect to it. We assume a and b to 
be prime with respect to each other, because, otherwise, their quotient 
would be a whole number, and we know that the root of an imperfect 
power is found between two whole numbers. We have, then, 

y/5'= — . From which, by squaring both members, there results 
5 = -y^- The first member of this equation being a whole number, 
the second member must be a whole number also. But —^ cannot be 

a whole number unless a^ is divisible by I ; for, to divide a^ by b^, is 
to divide it twice by b. Of course, then, if a^ is not divisible by b, it 
cannot be divisible by b^. But a^ is not divisible by h, for, by the fore- 
going theorem, a number which exactly divides the product of two 
factors, and is prime with respect to one of thenj, must divide the 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 177 

otter. Now tte factors of o^ are a and a ; 6 is prime with respect 
to the first factor, it must then divide the second in order to give an 
entire quotient. This is plainly impossible, since the second factor is 
the same as the first; a^ is, then, not divisible by h; still less, then, 

can a^ be divisible by Ir. The equation 5 = — must, therefore, be 

absurd ; but that equation has been truly derived from the equation 

v/? = -r- A correct algebraic operation has led to an absurd result : 
b 

but this can only be so when the assumption at the outset, upon which 
the operation is based, is absurd. The assumption, •>/~o= — was ab- 
surd, and it has led to an absurd result. 

The foregoing reasoning has been in no way dependent upon the 
fact that 5 was the particular imperfect power under consideration, and 
is, therefore, general. We conclude, then, that the square root of no 
imperfect power can be expressed by an exact fraction. 



EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT OF FRACTIONS. 

249. Since the square of a fraction is formed by squaring the nume- 
rator and denominator separately, it follows that the square root of a 
fraction must be taken by extracting the square root of the numerator 
and denominator separately. 

Thus, ^^ = 'j, since -5X3= |. 



,0, also, \/'jr, = j, because j X - = -^, 



We may remark that all square roots can be affected with either the 
positive or negative sign, if these roots are regarded as algebraic quan- 
tities. Thus, the \/| may be either + |, or — |, because — | X — 

„ . „ , / a^ 1.1 (I a . a

250. Those examples show that the positive square roots of proper 
fractious are greater than the fractions themselves. Thus, ^ {- := h. 
The reason of this is plain : the numerator of a proper fraction being 
less than the denominator, is not diminished proportionally so much as 
the denominator by the extraction of the square root. Let a^ and 1/ be 
two unequal squares, and let a^ ^ b^; then, a ^ h, when a and b are 
both positive. Extracting the square roots of a^ and b'^, we have 
n and b for the roots. The extraction of the root has then diminished 
fi^ a fold, and ?/ only b fold. The greater quantity has, then, been 
diminished the most. 

251. The positive roots of improper fractions aVe less than the frac- 
tions themselves, because the extraction of the 'root diminishes their 
numerators more than it diminishes their denominators. 

The negative roots of all fractions, whether proper or improper, are, 
of course, algebraically less than the fractions themselves. 

252. In the foregoing examples the numerators and denominators 
were all perfect squares. But, if we have a fraction whose denomi- 
nator is not a perfect square, we can readily find its exact root to within 
less than unity, divided by the denominator of the fraction. Let it 
be required to extract the square root of |. AYe multiply the nume- 
rator and denominator of the fraction by the denominator, which does 

not alter the value of the fraction, and we have V I == \ / '? — -?• = 

" V 5 X 5 

v/4f = f +. The root of the numerator lies between 6 and 7. The 

root of the fraction is greater than ^, and less than |; and we see that 

I is the true value of the fraction to within less than ^. By this, we 

mean that when we take £ as the true root of the fraction, we commit 

an error less than i. We can, of course, get a nearer approximation to 

the true value of the fraction by multiplying both terms of the fraction 

by the third, fifth, seventh, or some odd power of the denominator. This 

will make the denominator a perfect power, and its root can be exactly

found. Thus, v & = \ / t e 5 f = V / ^^^T^ = ^ +• The 

' " V 5 X 5 X 5 X 5 V G2o 25 

true root is greater than |4, and less than -^'i. Hence, |i diflfers from 

the true root by a quantity less than ^'^. 

253. When the denominator and numerator are both imperfect 
powers, as in the example just given, we may make the numerator a 
perfect power by multiplying both terms of the fraction by the first, or 
some odd power, of the numerator. But, in this case, the degree of ap- 

proximation is not immediately appai-ent. Thus, \/| = v/k 5 = 

I approximatively. The true root is greater than |, and less than |. 
The degree of approximation can only be determined by reducing these 
fractions to a common denominator. We have, then, ^8^ and |ij, and 
their diifercnce is ^^tj. Then, ^| differs from the true root by a 
quantity less than ^%. And ||, or §, also differs from the true root 
by a quantity less than ^%. It is plain that the degree of approxima- 
tion can be more readily determined by making the denominator ra- 
tional than by making the numerator rational. It is even preferable to 
make the denominator rational when the numerator is already so. 
though the process of making the denominator a perfect square make 
the numerator irrational. Thus, to find the approximate root of |, place 

^^~ V 5X 5- ^55-5+- 

254. If the denominator is already rational, we have only to extract 
its root for a new denominator, and write over it the approximate root 
of the numerator for a new numerator. 

We have, then, for finding the approximate root of any fraction, both 
terms of which are not rational, the following 



EULE. 

Mahe the denominator rational, if not already so, hy nudtiplyhuj 
loth terms of the fr action hy the first, or some odd poicer of the denomi- 
nator, according to the degree of approximation required, so that the 
denominator of the given fraction shall he the square power of the de- 
nominator of the fraction that marks the degree of approximation. 
Then extract the root of the denominator for a new denominator, and 
torite over it the approximate root of the numerator for a neio numera- 
tor. Affect the nexo fraction with the douhle sign, to indicate that there

255. Since the denominator of the fraction may be raised to as high

alter the value of the given number, it simply placed it under the form 
of a fraction with a rational denominator. The nest step was to ex- 
tract the root of the numerator to within the nearest unit, and to write 
the result over the exact root of the denominator.

To extract the root of any whole number, a, to within any decimal

both terms of the fraction by 10^ 100', &c. Whatever the decimal, 
which marks the degree of approximation, may be, it can be changed 

into a vulgar fraction, ^^ ; in which m is a positive whole number, 

^n-eater by unity than the number of cyphers between the decimal point 
and first significant figure. Thus, -1 = -y— -„ and m = 1 ; -01 = -j^^'

MIXED NUMBERS. 

258. The approximate root of mixed numbers can now readily be 
found. Suppose it be required to find the approximate root of 2-5 to 
witliin -1. If we annexed two cyphers, as before, the result would be 
2500 J and then, when we shall have come to point off" into periods, the 
whole number, 2, will be united with the decimal 5. The root found will 
be 5, which is plainly absurd. But, 2-5, changed into an equivalent vul- 
gar fraction, is fg. Hence, by the rule for vulgar fractions, v/2-5 = 
N^fl = \/y§§ = t| + = 1"5 + • We see, that in the present instance, 
we hav^ annexed a single cypher, which made the decimal places even, 
and double the number of places required in the root. We next 
pointed off from the root the number of decimal places required. If we 
are required to find the approximate root of 2-5 to within ^i^, yj^^, or 

•01. Then, V2^ = v/fl - \/ '^\ll^^ = iB§ - 1-58- We 
have, obviously, added three cyphers to 5, and, therefore, made the 
number of decimal places even and equal to the number of places re- 
quired in the root. In pointing off for decimals, we have only pointed 
off two places, the number required in the root. To demonstrate 
the rule in a general manner, let a be the entire part of the mixed 

number, and ^z—;^ the decimal part. Then the given number will be

of b by (10)"" is the same as annexing m eypliers to b, and whenever 
m is odd, the number of decimal places will be even, and double the 
number required in the root. When m is even, the decimals will not 
be mixed with the whole numbers, as in the mixed number 3-4^ and 
there need be no cyphers annexed. 

We have supposed, in the general demonstration, that the number 
of decimal places required in the root was precisely equal to the num- 
ber of decimal places in the mixed number. But, if this were not the 
case, the denominator of the equivalent vulgar fraction has only to be 
multiplied by such a power of 10 as will make it 10 with an exponent 
twice as great as the number of places required in the root. The nu-

decimal places even, and equal to double the number of places required 
in the root.

number is even, and equal to double the mimber of places required in

mal, changed into an equivalent vulgar fraction, is j%. Hence, v/ -4 — 
y/-A^ = ■v/j''g% ^ y^o, ^^^ <C /o- Hence, -6 is the approximate root

EXTRACTION OF THE CUBE ROOT OF NUMBERS. 

262. The cuhe or third power of a quantity is the product arising 
from taking the quantity three times as a factor. Thus, the cube of 
m is m X m x m = m". The cube root of a quantity is one of the 
three equal factors into which the quantity can be resolved. The pro- 
cess of extracting the cube root consists, then, in seeking one of the 
equal factors which make up the given quantity. When the quantity 
can be exactly resolved into its three equal factors, it is said to be a 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 189 

perfect cube. But, when one of its factors can only be found approxi- 
uiatively, it is said to be an incommensurable quantity, or an imperfect 
cube. Thus, ^S, and ^^27 are perfect cubes; but -i/y, and </2i5 are 
incommensurable, or imperfect cubes. 

The first ten numbers are 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
and their cubes 

1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000. 

Reciprocally, the numbers of the first line are the cube* roots of the 
numbers of the second line. 

We see, by inspection, that there are but nine perfect cubes among 
all the numbers expressed by one, two, and three figures. All other 
numbers, except the nine written above, expressed by one, two, or 
three figures will be incommensurable, and their roots will be expressed 
by whole numbers plus irrational parts, which can only be determined 
approximatively. Thus, the ^d consists of the whole number 2, plus 
an irrational number. Because 9 lies between 8, whose cube root is 2, 
and 27, whose cube root is 3. By a course of reasoning similar to that 
already employed (Art. 248), it can be shown that the cube root of an 
imperfect cube, as 9, cannot be expressed by an exact vulgar fraction. 

For, if it can, let — be that vulgar fraction : then, ^'Wz=—, or 9 =: 
6 ^ 6 

-J. But, if— be an irreducible fraction, from what has been shown, 



7T- must be an irreducible fraction, and we then have a whole number 

equal to an irreducible fraction, which is absurd. And, since the 
generality of the reasoning has not been affected at all by the selection 
of the particular number, 9, we conclude that the root of an imperfect 
cube cannot be determined exactly. 

Before demonstrating a rule by which the roots of perfect cubes can 
be determined, or the roots of imperfect cubes found approximatively, 
it will be necessary to examine the manner in which a cube, or third 
power, is formed. When the number contains less than four figures, 
its cube root, or the entire part of that root, must be found among the 
first nine figures. When the number contains more than three figures, 
its root must be made up of a certain number of tens and units. Let 
a = tens of the root, and b = the units of the root. Then, the number 
will be (a -f ly. And, by actually lijultiplyiug (a + l>) the required 



190 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

number of times, we will get (a + bf = a^ + Sa^b -f Sab^ + i^. 
l''hat is, a number, whose root is made up of tens and units, is equal to 
the cube of the tens, plus three times the square of the tens by the units, 
plus three times the product of the tens by the square of the units, p>his 
the ctibe of the units. 

The formula may be written (a + bf = a^ + (Sa^ + Sab + V^h. 
And we see that the first thing to be done is to extract the cube root 
of a", then the tens (represented by a) will be known. It is obvious, 
too, that the true divisor of the remainder, after a^ has been taken out, 
to find b, or the units, is the coefficient of b, (3a^ + Sab -f V^) ', but. 
since b is unknown, the last two terms of this coefficient, Sab and //, 
are unknown. Hence, we are compelled to use Sa^ as an approximate 
divisor of the first remainder to find b. Now, b, thus found, will, in 
every case, be too great, because the divisor has been too small ; but it 
may happen that when b is small, the addition of Sab + b^ to Sa^ would 
)iot diminish the quotient b by unity, and then there will be no error 
committed in assuming b to be the true quotient, provided we increase 
our divisor by Sab -\- b^, and form the parts that enter into the first 
remainder. 

We will illustrate by an example. Let it be required to extract the 
cube root of 1728. 

We begin by separating the three right hand figures, because the 

(I + b cube of 

Srt^ =300 l'72S 12 the tens 

(Sa -\-b)b = (SO i- 2)2= 64 1000= a^ must be, 

(Sa' + Sab+P) =364 72S = (Sa' + Sab + b')b ^^ ^^''^^' 

728=(Sd^ + Sab + b^)b thousands, 
and, there- 
fore, cannot be contained in the right hand period. We next seek the 
greatest cube in the left hand period, which is really 1000 ; the root is 
one ten, or 10, we set it on the right, after the manner of a quotient in 
division. Sa^, or 300, is assumed as an approximate divisor of the 
remainder after a*, or 1000, has been taken from 1728. The remain- 
der, 728, being represented by (3(t'^ + Sab + li^)b, the true divisor to 
find b is, of course, the parenthetical coefficient of b. Having found b, 
or 2, by means of the approximate divisor, we set it on the right of the 
ten, separating it by a point to indicate that it is of a different denomi- 
nation. We next add {Sa + b)b, or 64, to Sa^, or 300, and we have 
364 for the true divisor, provided that b has been found correctly. 
This divisor we will call the supposed true divisor. Finally, we multi- 



EXTRACTION OF KOOTS. 191 

ply (3a^ + Sah + ¥, the supjjosed true dioisor by h, and the product 
made up (3a^ + 3a6 + i^)i, the parts entering: into the remainder. 
The product thus formed being exactly equal to the remainder, proved 
two things : first, that if the true, instead of the approximate, divisor 
had been used, h would not have been diminished by unity; and, 
second, that the number 1728 is an exact cube, and that its root is 
12. Iq the present example, it is easy to see why b was found 
correctly by using the approximate instead of the true divisor ; a and 
h being both small, the omission of ^ah + V^ did not materially aifect 
the divisor. 

\V'e have, from the foregoing, a simple test by which to ascertain 
whether h, found by using the approximate divisor, 3o^, must be di- 
minished. "Whenever the supposed true divisor will give a less quo- 
tient than I, we conclude that h was too great, and it must be dimi- 
nished by 1, 2, &c., until the supposed true divisor will enter into the 
remainder the same number of times as the approximate. It will never 
happen when the unit figure of the root is small with respect to the 
tens, as in 71, 82, 93, &c , that the h, found by using 3a^ as a divisor, 
must be diminished by unity, or some greater number. But, when the 
unit figure is great with respect to the tens, as in 18, 19, &c., it may 
be necessary to diminish h by one or more units. The reason of this 
is plain. We will illustrate by an example. Kequired the cube root 
of 5832. 

"We see that i, found by using 30^^ as a divisor, is IG, and the sup- 
posed true divisor will 

then be 1036; but this, 5832 ] 

instead of entering IG 3a' =r 300 1000 

times into the remainder, (30 + 16)16 = 736 4832 ^' 

4832, will only enter 4 (1036)16 = 16576 

times. Besides, 1036, or 

the supposed (3a^ + ^ah + b^), when multiplied by b, will give a pro- 
duct, 16576, greater than the remainder. The unit figure is then too 
great, and has to be diminished by 8 ; this diminution can only be 
determined by trial. The process ought to have been 





5832 a + b 




1000 1'8 


3a2 = 300 


4832 = (3a2 + 3o6 -f b^)h 


(30 -f 8) 8 = (3« + h)h = 304 


4832 = (3a2 -|- ^ab + V)h 


3a2 + 3a5 + h^ =604 





192 FORMATION OF THE P AV E R S AND 

The true divisor by trial was found to be 604. This divisor was repre- 
sented by (3a^ + Sah + J/), and, when multiplied by b, or 8, gave 
(Sa^ + Sab + V)b, the remainder. 
Take,. as another example, G859. 

6 859 I a-\-b 
3a^ =300 1000 I 19 

(3a + &)i = (30 + 9)9 = 351 5 859 = (3a^ + Sab + h^j 
3a2 + Sah -^W = 651 5 859 = (3a^ + Sab + W)b 

By trial, 9 was found to be the second figure of the root, the sup- 
posed true divisor was then determined to be 651, and this, multiplied 
by b or 9, gave 5859. The given number was then a perfect cube, and 
19 its exact root. In this case, the supposed true divisor is actually 
the true divisor. 

263. The process for extracting the cube root of a number below 
10000 may be without any difficulty extended to all numbers whatever. 
Suppose the number to be 1881365963625, its root may still be re- 
garded as made up of tens and units, the cube of the tens cannot enter 
into the last three figures, 625, on the right, and they may, therefore, 
be separated from the other figures. The greatest cube contained in 
1881365963 must have more than one figure in its root, because the 
number is greater than 1000, which contains two figures in its root. 
Then the root of 1881365963 may be regarded as made up of tens and 
units ; and, as the cube of the tens cannot give a less denomination 
than thousands, the tens cannot be found in the last three figures, 963, 
which may, therefore, be separated from the other figures. After the 
separation of 963 the foregoing reasoning may be repeated, and thus 
dividing the number into periods of three figures until we come, at 
length, to the place occupied by the cube of the tens of the highest 
order. The period on the left thus found, may contain but one figure, 
as in the present example, or it may contain two figures, or even three 
figures. We will designate the tens of the highest order by a', those 
of the second order by a", those of the third by a"', &c. In like man- 
ner, we will designate the units of the highest order by U, those of the 
second order by b", &c.

lu this example, we begin by dividing the nuuiber off into periods 
of three figures each ; the period on the left contains but one figure. 
We extract the greatest cube contained in this period, and set the root, 
1, on the right. We then have found a', or the tens of the highest 
denomination. We then bring down the next period. Now, since but 
two periods are under consideration, the a', or 1, found, will be tens 
with respect to these two periods, and therefore, three times its square, 
or 3a'^ = 300. This is, then, the first approximate divisor. Dividing 
881 by it, we get 2, or the supposed units contained in the root of the 
two left hand periods, we then add 64, or (Sa' + ?/)6', to the approxi- 
mate divisor, and, if U be the true units of the root, 364, or 3a'^ -f 
SaU + h'^, will be the true divisor. Now, since 364 enters into 881, 
the same number of times that 300 does, b' has been found correctly. 
We, therefore, multiply 364 by 2, and we form the three parts, (Sa'^ 
+ 'dab' -\- b'^)b', of which the remainder, 881, is composed, except 
some tens and units which have been incorporated in it from the cube 
of the tens of a lower denomination. We subtract 728 from 881, and 
bring down the next period. Now, the next approximate divisor is 
plainly three times the square of 120, or 43200. But the shortest way 
of getting three times the square of 120 is to add 64, and the S({uare 
of b', or 2, to the true divisor, and multiply the sum of the three by 
100. The reason of this is apparent. The tens of the next denomina- 
tion is found by dividing 153365 by 43200 ) the quotient 3 is set on 
the right of the 2 in the root, separated from it by a dot. We next 
add 1089, or (3a" + b")b", to 43200, and we have the second true 
divisor. Multiplying this divisor by 3, and subtracting the product 
from 153365, and bringing down the next period, we have a new 
17 N 



194 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

number, the root of whose unit is to be found. The approximate di- 
visor to find h'" must be three times the square of 1230 ; and this is 
most readily found by adding 1089 and the square of h", or 3, to 
43200, and multiplying the sum by 100 ; that is, annexing two cyphers 
to the sum. The approximate divisor thus found, 4538700, enters 4 
times in 20498365, and the true divisor, when formed, enters the same 
number of times ; 4 is then, truly, the fourth figure of the root. Mul- 
tiply 4538700, the true divisor, by the last figure of the root, subtract 
the product from 20498365, and bring down the next period. The 
next approximate divisor is three times the square of 12340 ; this can 
readily be formed like the preceding. The true divisor is formed when 
5, the final unit, has been determined. The true divisor, multiplied 
by 5, gives a product equal to the last remainder. Hence, the given 
number is a perfect cube, and 12345 is its exact root. 

The reason of the above process becomes very plain upon a slight 
examination. It was established at the outset, that the tens and units 
contained in the first two periods could be sought, independently of the 
other periods. Having found found 1 ten and 2 units in the first two 
periods, it is plain that this number, 12, is the tens in 123, the root 
found in the first three periods. So, 123 may be regarded as the tens 
of the first four periods. The root found in these periods is 1234, 
made up of 123 tens and 4 units. In like manner, 1234 may be re- 
garded as the tens of the root of the whole five periods. In fact, the 
root found, 12345, is made up of 1234 tens and 5 units. 

We then had tens of different denominations, 1 ten, 12 tens, 123 
tens, and 1234 tens. To apply the general formula, (a -f lif = a' + 
3«^& -f ^aW -f 1/, for the cube of a number made up of tens and units, 
to determining the tens and units contained in any two consecutive 
periods, it became necessary to distinguish the tens by dashes to indi- 
cate the denomination to which they belonged. 

We will add another example, to show more fully the application of 
the preceding principles. Required the cube root of 997002999.

proximate divisor, 24300, is ] ; but this is manifestly absurd. By 
trial, 9 is found to be the second figure of the root, because the true 
divisor, 26811, enters 9 times, neither more nor less, in 268002. 

We have for the extraction of the cube root of any number above 
1000, the foUovring 

RULE. 

I. Begin on the right and divide off periods of three jigures each. 
There will remain on the left a period of one, tico, or three figures. 

II. Extract the greatest cube contained in the left hand period, and 
set the root on the right, after the manner of a quotient in division. 
Subtract the cube of the root from the left hand period, and brivg 
doivn the next period. 

III. Talce three times the sqnai-e of the root found, regarded as tens, 
and set it on the left as an approximate divisor; see how often this 
enters into the first remainder. The quotient icill be the second figure 
of the root, or something greater. Add to the ajyproximate divisor the 
product of three times the first figure of the root, regarded as tens, plu:^ 
the second figure of the root by the second figure of the root. The sum 
of this product and the approximate divisor %oiU be the true divisor 
if it enter into the remainder the same number of times as the ajiproxi- 
mate divisor. Multiply the true divisor by the second figure of the 
root, sidttract the product from the first remainder, and bring doicn the 
next period. 

IV. Add to the first trtie divisor the same number that was before 
added to the approximate divisor, plus the square of the second figure 
of the root, and annex two cyphers to the sum, the residt will be the 
second approximate divisor. The true divisor is found as before. 
Continue this process until all the p)eriods are brought doicn ; then, if 
the last true divisor, midtiplicd by the fined units of the root, gives a 
product exactly equal to the last remainder, the given number is a per- 
fect ctdie, and its exact root has been found.

APPROXIMATE ROOTS OF INCOMMENSURABLE NUMBERS. 

264. Let a represent any incommensurable number — we have seen that 
its root cannot be expressed by an exact fraction ; it may, however, be 

truly determined to within less than any fraction, — , whose numerator

CUBE ROOT OF FRACTIONS. 

265. Since the cube, or third power, of a fraction is formed by 
raising the numerator and denominator separately to the third power, 
the cube root of a fraction can plainly be found bj- extracting the root 
of the numerator and denominator separately. The root of the nume- 
rator written over the root of the denominator will then be the root of 
the fraction. 

There are three cases: 1. The numerator and denominator of the 
given fraction may be both perfect cubes, and then the root of the one 
written over the root of the other will be the required root. 2. The 
numerator may be an imperfect cube, and the denominator a perfect 
cube, then the root of the numerator extracted to within the nearest unit, 
written over the exact root of the denominator, will be the approximate 
root to within less than unity, divided by the root of the denominator. 
3. Both the num.erator and denominator may be imperfect cubes, or 
the denominator only may be an imperfect cube, then the denominator 
must be made a perfect cube by multiplying it by its second power. 
The numerator must also be multiplied by the same number, otherwise 
17* 



19S FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

the value of the fraction will bo altered. The root of the new nume- 
rator, to within the nearest unit written over the exact root of the new 
denominator, will be the approximate root required. If a nearer degree 
of approximation be required, both terms of the fraction may be multi- 
plied by the 5th, 8th, &c. power of the denominator. The reason for 
making the denominator rational rather than the numerator, is the 
same as that given in the explanation of the principles involved in ex- 
tracting the square root of fractions. 

The rule for the extraction of the cube root of fractions belonging to 
either of the three foregoing classes, is as follows : 



RULE. 

Make the denominator rational, if not already so, hi/ multiplying 
hoth terms of the fraction hy the square power of the denominator. 
Extract the root of the new numerator to within the nearest unit, and 
lorite the root found over the root of the new denominator, which will 
he the same as the denominator of the given fraction. If a nearer de- 
gree of approximation he required, hoth terms of the fraction may he 
multiplied hy the bth, Sth, &c. powers of the denom{?iator. The root

tiply both terms of the given fraction by such a number as will make the 
denominator a perfect third power of the denominator of the fraction 
that marks the degree of approximation, and then extract the root of 
the new fraction. Let it be required to extract the cube root of '^^ to 
within \, then the given fraction must have its numerator and denomi- 
nator multiplied by 32, in order to make the denominator 64, the cube

APPROXIMATE ROOT TO WITIIIX A CERTAIN DECIMAL. 

267. There are two cases : the given number whose root is to be 
found may be entire, or it may be mixed ; partly entire and partly 
decimal. 

CASE I. 

Approximate root oftoJiole numbers to ivitJiin a certain decimal. 

If the decimal fraction that marks the degree of approximation be 
changed into an equivalent vulgar fraction, the cube of its denominator 
will be unity, followed by three, six, nine, twelve, or some multiple of 
three cyphers. In other words, the cube of the denominator will con- 
tain unity, followed by as many periods of three cyphers each, counting 
from the right, as there are decimal places in the fraction of approxi- 
mation. Thus (-1/ = {-.^J = ^J,^ . (-Ol)' = (^1^^ = y.^^^^. 
Then, to multiply the given number by the cube of the denominator of 
the decimal changed into a vulgar fraction is nothing more than an- 
nexing three, six, nine, or some multiple of three cyphers. After a 
now number has thus been formed, the extraction /of the root is, of

thing as dividing the root of the new numher hy the denominator of the 
fraction of approximation changed into an eQuivalent vulgar fraction.

Wc see that when the decimal has been changed into a vulgar frac- 
tion, and the denominator made rational, the numerator, 2300, is the 
given number, with the point omitted, and with cyphers enough an- 
nexed to make the number of places, counting from where the point 
was, a multiple of three. If it had been required to extract the cube root 
of 2-3 to within -01,. it would have been necessary to add five cyphers

to 3 ; the number of decimal places then would have been made a mul- 
tiple of 8. Now, in pointing off for decimals, it is plain that we point 
off as many places for decimals as there are places required in the root. 
For, if one decimal place be required in the root, the denominator of 
the root of the equivalent Aiilgar fraction will be 10; if two places be 
required, it will be 100, &c. 

RULE. 

Annex cyphers to the decimal part of the mixed number until there 
are three places, if one place he required in the root ; six places if two 
he required in the root, &c. Extract the root of the new number thics 
formed as a whole number, and point off from the right the required 
number of decimals.

Ans. 10-4 nearly. 

7. Required the cube root of 5011-125 to within -1. Ans. 17-1. 

In the 4th and 5th examples, one cypher only had to be annexed. 
In the last two examples, no annexation was required. But if the 
root in the last two examples is to be determined within -01, then 
three additional cyphers must be annexed ; if within -001, six addi- 
tional cyphers, &c. 

The reason for annexing cyphers until the decimal places can be 
separated into periods of three figures, is evident, even without ehang- 



202 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

ing the decimal into an equivalent vulgar fraction. For each period 
of three figures must give one figure in the root , if, then, the decimal 
places were not made multiples of three, when we come to point ofi" 
from the right the decimals would be mixed with the whole number. 
Suppose we were required to find the root of 8-72 to within -1. Now, 
8-72 is but little greater than 8, whose root is 2. Hence, the root of 
8-72 ought to be but little greater than two; but if we annexed no 
cypher to 72, we would have but one period, 872, and the root would 
be 9 approximatively. 



APPROXIMATE ROOT OF DECIMAL FRACTIONS TO WITHIN 
A CERTAIN DECIMAL. 

269. A decimal fraction changed into an equivalent vulgar fraction 
will have a rational denominator when its number of decimal places are 
multiples of three. 

Thus, -021 = ^§1^, -007681 = toVoUo. -123456789 = j^^WVo- 

Hence, if cyphers be annexed to the decimal until the number of 
places are made multiples of three, the new fraction, when changed 
into an equivalent vulgar fraction, will have a rational denominator. 
And, since every period of three figures gives one figure in the root, 
cyphers must be annexed until the number of periods of three figures 
is exactly equal to the number of places required in the root. 

RULE. 

Annex cyphers to the given decimal until it can he divided off into 
as many periods of three jigures each as there are places required in 
the root. Extract the root of the oicw decimal thus formed to vnthin

11. Required the cube root of 0125 to within -01. Ans. -23. 

12. Required the cube root of -125. Ans. -5, commensurable. 

In some of the examples, it was necessary to annex one cypher, in 
others, two cyphers; in others, again, three cyphers. It will be seen 
that the root is greater than the number ; this ought to be so, since the 
denominator of the decimal changed into a vulgar fraction is greater 
than the numerator.

270. Any vulgar fraction may be changed into an equivalent deci- 
mal fraction by annexing cyphers to the numerator, and dividing the 
new numerator thus formed by the denominator. The equivalent deci- 
mal will be mixed, or purely decimal, according as the given fraction 
is improper or proper. The division of the new numerator by the 
given denominator must be continued until the decimal part of the 
quotient contains as many periods of three figures as there are places 
required in the root. 



Change the vulgar fraction into an equivalent decimal fraction, and

General Rcmca-Jcs on the Extraction of the Giihe Root. 

271. In extracting the cube root, we formed the three parts of 
which each successive remainder was composed, regard being had to 
the denomination of the tens and units in those remainders. But, 
since any number, when cubed, gives as many periods of three figures 
each, counting from the right, as there are phices of figures in the 
given number (the period on the left, however, not necessarily contain- 
ing more than one or two figures), it is plain that the first two periods 
on the left of the given number give the first two figures on the left of 
the root. The first three periods on the left give, in like manner, the 
first three figures on the left of the root, and so on. It is evident, then, 
that it is not necessary to form the three parts of which the successive 
remainders are composed; we have only, when the first figure of the root 
has been found, to cube it, and subtract the cube from the left hand 
period. "When the second figure of the root has been found by using 
the approximate divisor, 3a'^, we have only to cube the two figures 
found, and subtract the cube from the two left hand periods, and bring 
down the next period, and so on. If the cube of the first two figures 
of the root exceed the first two periods on the left, the second figure of 
the root must be diminished until the cube of the two figures is equal 
to, or less than the two periods on the left. The successive figures of 
the root can only then be ascertained by trial. We can always tell, by 
cubing the two, three, or four figures of the root found, when the last 
figure is too great ; but some test is necessary to point out when we 
have diminished the last figvire too much. That test depends upon the 
principle, that the difi"ercnce between two consecutive numbers is equal 
to three times the square of the smaller number, plus three times the 
smaller number, plus unity. 

Let a be the smaller number, then the consecutive number next 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 205 

above it will be a+1. And (a + lf— {af = a^SaHSa + l — a» 
= 3a^ + 3a + 1, as enunciated. If, tben, after subtracting the cube 
of tlie figures found from the periods on the left, the remainder is ex- 
actly equal to three times the square of the root found, plus three times 
this root, plus unity, the last figure of the root can be increased exactly 
by unity. If the remainder is greater than this quantity, the last 
figure can be increased by unity, or something more than unity. 

The following examples will illustrate the foregoing process. Re- 
quired the cube root of 531441. 

531441 I « + i 
Sa' = 19200 512 | S'l 

19 441 
531 441 = (a + If. 

After finding the tens of the root, the approximate divisor entered 
once in the remainder, the quotient was set on the right of the root 
found, and the two figures of the root (81), when cubed, gave the 
original number. Hence, the number was a perfect cube, and 81 its 
exact root. 

Take, as a second example, 081472. 

G81472 \ a + b 
Sa' = 19200 512 | 8 8 

169 472 

681 472 = (a + by 

The approximate divisor gives 9 for the second figure of the root ; 
but 89, when cubed, exceeds the given number, 681472. The last 
figure, must, therefore, be diminished, if we make this figure, 7, and 
cube 87, the cube when subtracted from 681472, leaves a remainder 
exactly equal to three times the square of 87, plus three times 87, plus 
unity. The last figure, then, can be increased exactly by unity, and 
88 is the true root. 

272. The formula for the difl'erence between consecutive cubes, 
enables us to pass from the cube of one number to the cube of the 
number next above it without actually cubing the higher number. 
Thus, since, the cube of 10 is 1000, the cube of 11 must be 1000 + 
3 (10/ + 3 (10) +1 = 1000 -f 300 +30 -fl = 1331. In like man- 
ner, since (64)^ = 262144; then (65)=" = 262144 + 3 (64)^ + 3 (64) 
+ 1 = 262144 + 12288 + 192 + 1 = 274625. When the numbers 
18 



206 FORMATION OF THE TOWERS AND 

nuder consideration are very large, the formula will save a great deal 
t)f trouble in deducing the cube of the higher number. 

The second process that we have given for extracting the cube root 
is usually followed, and when the given number contains but two 
periods, is shorter than the first process ; but in every other case is 
lonii-er. 



EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT OF ALGEBRAIC 
QUANTITIES. 

273. We will first show how to extract the root of monomials. 

Since all rules for the extraction of roots must be founded iipon the 
rules for the formation of powers, we must first examine, in the present 
ease, how the power of a monomial is formed. Let P represent the 
numerical coefficient of any monomial, and a" the literal part of the 
monomial. Then, the monomial will be Pa" j now, to square Pa"', is 
to multiply it once by itself. And Pa" X Pa™ = P^a^". Hence, to 
square a -monomial, we have only to square the coefficient, and to 
double the exponent of each literal factor. The square of 2o-c is, by 
the rvile, 4a*c^. The square of ba~^chl~^ is, by the rule, 2ba~'^c'*d~*. 
The square root of 4aV is then, of course, 2a^c; but — 2a^c will, when 
multiplied by itself, give 4aV. Hence, the root of 4a''c^ may be either 
+ 2a^c, or — 2a^c. So, in like manner, the root of 25a~V<:?"'' may 
be either + 5a~'c^(?~^, or — ba~^c^d~'^.

It is plain that a monomial will not be a perfect power when its co- 
efficient is not a perfect square, and when every exponent is not some 
multiple of 2. But wlien the exponents of the literal factors are not 
exactly divisible by the index of the root, the division can be indicated. 

Tlius, v/4x = =t 2.r-, for, by the rules for multiplication, (db 2.r-) 

(=h 2x~) = ix. Hence, =t 2a:- is, truly, the square root of -ix. So, 

also, VTiV = it oH^c^, because (it ah^c^) (=t ahh^) = al^c'. 
The square roots, then, of all algebraic quantities may be truly ex- 
pressed whenever their coefficients are perfect squares. 



SQUARE ROOT OF POLYNOMIALS. 

274. A trinomial is the least polynomial th^t is a perfect square. 
It would be a mistake to suppose that the square root of a^ + Ir is 
a + h, for (a -f hf = a^ + 2ah + l\ The term, lab, enters into 
the square of (a -f h), and is not found in a' -\- 1/. Any polynomial, 
to be a perfect square, must be susceptible of resolution into two equal 
factors ; and we know that when these factors are multiplied together to 
reproduce the polynomial, the two extreme terms of the product (if the 



208 F O 11 M A T I O N OF T II E P W E R S A N D 

factors have been arranged with reference to a certain letter) are irredu- 
cible with the other terms. Hence, the square root of these extreme 
terms must be terms of the whole root. The extreme terms of s/a^-]-l/ 
must then be a and h, but the intermediate terras can only be found 
approximatively. 

Any binomial, as (a' + s), when squared, will give a trinomial, a'^ + 
2a's + s^. Conversely, if we have any trinomial that is a perfect 
square, its root must be a binomial. 

Let it be required to extract the square root of ISah + 81o^ + 7/. 
If this trinomial be arranged with reference to the highest power of 
one of its letters, as a, and the square root of the first term be taken, 
we know that we have certainly one term of the root required, Be- 
cause, from what has been said, we know that the first term of the 
arranged trinomial is the product of the first terms of the two equal 
factors into which the trinomial can be resolved. In other words, it is 
the square of the first term of the required root. The arranged poly- 
nomial is Sla'^ + ISab 
81a- '+ ISah -f h' I 9a + b + h'. We begin by 

Sla^ = a'^ \lSa + b = 2a's + s extracting the root of 

2a's -f s^ = ISab + 6^ the first term, and set 

18«6 + b^ this root in the same 

horizontal line with the 
polynomial, and on its right separated by a vertical bar. We subtract 
from the given quantity the square of the first term of the root ; there 
remain, then, only the two terms, 18a?> + b^. Now, we know that 
the first term of this remainder, ISab, is the double product of the first 
term of the root by the unknown second term. If, then, we divide 
18aZ» by 2 (9a), or 18a, the quotient, b, must be the second term of 
the root. The root is then completely known. The result can be 
verified by squaring the root 9a -\- b ; or, since the remainder ISob 
+ b^ con-esponds to 2a's + s'^, and since 18a corresponds to 2a', if we 
write 18a below the root, and b, which corresponds to s, on its right, 
and then multiply 18a + & by Z>, we must evidently form the remain- 
der, 2a's -f si 

275. Since, when a trinomial is a perfect square, its extreme terms 
must be perfect squares, and its mean term must be the double product 
of the roots of these terms, we can tell in a moment when a trinomial 
is a perfect square ; the mean term of the aiTanged trinomial must always 
be the double product of the roots of the extreme terms. Let us apply 



EXTEACTION OF ROOTS. 209 

tMs simple test to some expressions. 4a^ + 4ma + rr^ is a perfect 
square, and its root 2a + m ; a + 2 V a6 + 6 is a perfect square, since 

the test is satisfied, and the root, -^ a + s/h -, .r^ -\-2.x-y~ -\-i/ is a per- 

3 3 

feet square, and its root, x~ + y~. 

The root, however, will only be commensurable when the extreme 
terms of the arranged trinomial are rational. We have, from the fore- 
going, a simple rule for the extraction of the root of a trinomial that is 
a perfect square. 



Extract the root of the extreme terms, and connect their roots together 
1)1/ the sign of the mean term. 

Thus, the square root of m^ — 2mn + n^ is m — n; this is obvious, 
since {in — iif = m^ — 2mn + n^ ; or it may be seen by going through 
the steps of the process described.

Bema7-7:s. 

Examples 2 and 4, in connection with 7 and 8, show, that when the 
mean term of the trinomial is negative there will be two distinct roots, 
according to the arrangement of the terms. The reason of this is 
plain. It is evident, moreover, that when either of the extreme terms 
has the negative sign, or when both are negative, the root will be 
imaginary.

210 FORMATION OF TUE POWERS AND 

The rule for the extraction of the square root of a trinomial has an 
important application in the solution of complete equations of the second 
degree, and ought, therefore, to be remembered. 

270. If the given numher, instead ofheing a trinomial, have a tri- 
nomial root. 

Let a + m -\- n represent this root. Then, by representing a + m 
by p, and the given polynomial by N, we have N = (^ + n)^ = 
jp2 _|_ 2pn + n^ = a^ + 2am + m^ + 2 (a + m) « + n^. We see 
that the first three terms is a perfect square, and the root may be 
found by the rule for the extraction of the root of a trinomial ; then, 
when we have taken the square of the root, a^ + 2am + ??i^, from the 
given polynomial, there will remain 2 (a. + m') n -f n"^. The first term 
of this remainder, 2an, divided by 2a, the double of the first term of 
the root will give n, the third term of the root. The remainder, 
2 (a + m)rt -f n^, may be put under the form (2a + 2m -f 71)%. If, 
then, the first two terms of the root found be doubled, and the third 
term added to them, and their sum be multiplied by the third term, 
the product thus formed will be equal to the remainder. The process 
for extracting the root of a polynomial which is the square of a trino- 
mial, is precisely like that for extracting the root of a polynomial which 
is the square of a binomial. The divisor, to get any term of the root 
after the first, is twice the first term of the root ; the terms of the root 
preceding the last term found are doubled, the last term added, and 
the product of the whole, by the last term, subtracted from the succes- 
sive remainders. 

The diifcrcnt steps can be best exhibited by the following example : 



a" = 4:n' 



2m-f3m+5 



4n + 3m 



2am+7n^-{-2 (^a+m)n-\-nr=127nn + dm^-\-i:nb-\-Qmb-\-h^ 4?i-}-6m-f?» 

2am+m''=12«m-f9m^ 

2 (a + m)n-irn''=4:7ib+Qmb-\-b'^ 
(2a + 2m+n)n=4:nb-^Qmb-\-b^ 

We began by extracting the root of the first term, the root found 
was set on the right, and its square subtracted from the given polyno- 
mial. We had, then, taken out a^ of the formula from the given ex- 
pressions 5 we next doubled the root found, and used this double root 
(2rt of the formula) as a divisor to find the second term. This, when 
found (to of the formula), was set on the right of 2??, and connected by 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 211 

its appropriate sign. The double of the first term, and the second 
term, written directly under the root, were next multiplied by the 
second term. We thus formed "lam -\- m^ of the formula, which, when 
subtracted from the first remainder, left -inh + 6mh + l^, correspond- 
ing to 2 (a + m) 71 + ?i^ of the formula. The first term of this remain- 
der (2an of the formula), divided by twice the first term (2rt of the 
formula), obviously, gave the third term (?() of the formula. The first 
two terms of the root were next doubled, and the third term added to 
their sum. Having thus formed 2a + 2m + m of the formula, wc 
multiplied this sum, 4?i + Qm,-\-h, by the third term, h, (or n of the 
formula). We thus plainly formed the three parts of which the re- 
mainder was composed; and the product being exactly equal to the 
last remainder, the polynomial had an exact root, 2« + 3m -|- h. 

The foregoing reasoning can be readily extended to a polynomial 
whose root contains four terms. For, let N represent the polynomial, I, 
the sum of the first three terms of the root, and n the last term of root. 
Then, '^ = {I -\- nf = F + 2ln -f n^. Suppose the first three terms 
to be a, h and c; then, N = (a -f i + c)^ -f 2 (a + h + c)n + ii". 
Now, the first three terms is the square of a trinomial, and the root can, 
therefore, be extracted precisely as in the foregoing example. After 
the square of the root has been subtracted from the given polynomial 
there will remain 2 (a + b + c) n+ii^. The divisor to find n is, ob- 
viously, still 2a, twice the first term of the root. And, since th( 
remainder can be placed under the form of | 2 (a -f- S 4- c) -f- » | n, it 
is plain that, if the last term be added to twice the sum of the first three 
terms, and the whole sum be multiplied by the last term, we will form 
the three parts of the remainder. The process for extracting the root 
of a polynomial which is the square of four terras, is then identical with 
that for exti-acting the root of a polynomial which is the square of three 
terms, and that, we have seen, is the same as the process for extracting 
the root of a polynomial that is the square of a binomial. Now, if the 
root is composed of five terms, after the square of the first four terms 
has been subtracted from the given polynomial, the remainder will be 
found to be the double product of the four terms found by the untnown 
fifth term, and the divisor to find this term will still be twice the 
first term of the root. And so the reasoning may be extended to a 
polynomial whose root is made up of six, seven, or any number of 
terms. Hence, for extracting the root of any polynomial, we have the 
followins: 



212 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 



RULE. 

Arrange the polynomial 7vit7i reference to one of its letters. Extract 
tlie root of the first term, and set the root in the same horizontal line 
icith the given polynomial, and on its right, separated from it hy a 
vertical bar. Suhtract the square of the root found from the given 
polynomial, and hring down the remaining terms for the first remain- 
der. Write double the first term of the root found immediately be- 
neath the place of the root, divide the first term of the first remainder by 
it, and write the quotient, lohich is the second term of the root, on the right 
of the first term of the root, and also beneath and on the right of double 
this term. Multiply the double of the first term, and the second term, 
itself affected with its propter sign, by the second term, and subtract 
the binomial product from this first remainder, and bring dotcn the re- 
maining terms for the second remainder. Divide the first term of the 
second remainder by the double of the first term of the root, and the 
quotient, affected with its proper sign, will be the third term of the root. 
Set this third term in the root, and also in another horizontal line on 
the right of double the sum of the first two terms of the root. Midtiply 
the three terms in this horizontal line by the third term, and subtract 
their product from the second remainder. Continue this process until 
the final remainder is zero, the root will then be exact; or continue 
until the letter, according to which the polynomial has been arranged, 
has disappeared from one of the remainders. Tlien, if all the expo- 
nents of that letter in the given polynomial are positive, we conchide 
that the polynomial is not a perfect square.

277. After the beginner has become familiar with the preceding 
principles, it will not always be necessary to go through the process 
of forming the successive remainders. The successive products, distin- 
guished by parentheses, may be all formed, and their sum taken at 
once from the given polynomial, as in the following example. 



TO* — 6mn + Ore* + imp — 2mq — \2np + 6/17 -f 4p* — 4p2 -f 5*

We have distinguished the successive products by parentheses, 
affected by exponents written on the left. 

278. It is obvious that the successive steps required by the general 
rule for extracting the square root of any polynomial, amount to nothing 
more than subtracting the square of the algebraic sum of the terms of 
the root, as they are found, from the given polynomial. In some cases, 
then, it may save trouble to subtract the square of the algebraic sum 
of the first two terms of the root from the given polynomial, then bring 
down the remaining terms and find the third term. Next, subtract 
the square of the algebraic sum of the first three terms of the root from 
the given polynomial, and continue in this way until all the terras of 
the root are found.

SQUARE ROOT OF A POLYNOMIAL INVOLVING NEGATIVE 
EXPONENTS. 

279. The principles for the extraction of the root of a polynomial 
containing negative exponents are the same as for the extraction of the 
square root of a polynomial, all of whose exponents are positive, observ- 
ing, however, in the arrangement of the polynomial, that that negative 
exponent is the least algebraically which is the greatest numerically. 
When, too, the arranged letter has disappeared from any remainder, it

may be supplied witli a zero exponent, provided, that the exponent of 
the same letter is negative in some of the terms. 

Take, as an example, x-"^ + 2,x-^i/ + x^if + 2.xif +2y + y^. 

Arranging the polynomial with reference to the ascending powers of 
X, and proceeding as before, we have

The first term of the second remainder is 2y ; x, the letter accord- 
ing to which the polynomial was arranged, docs not enter into this re-

INCOMMENSURABLE POLYNOMIALS. 



280. When the exponent of the letter, according to which the poly- 
nomial is arranged, is positive in all the terms, we know that the poly- 
nomial is incommensurable when this letter is not found in any of the 
successive remainders, or is found affected with a lower exponent than 
it appears with in the first term of the root. But, if the letter, accord- 
ing to which the arrangement is made, appear in some of the terms 
with a negative exponent, we can only tell that the given polynomial 
is not commensurable by observing that the operation would never end.

SQUARE ROOT OF POLYNOMIALS CONTAINING TERMS 
AFFECTED WITH FRACTIONAL EXPONENTS. 

281. Since, in multiplication, the exponents of like letters are added, 
whether they be fractional, or entire, it is evident that the square of 

m m m Zm 2m m 

rt"" = a° X a" is a ° . Hence, the square root of a^ is a" . Quanti- 
ties involving fractional exponents may then be operated upon in the 
same manner as quantities containing only entire exponents. This will 
be shown more fully under the head of fractional exponents. Assum- 
ing a truth which scarcely needs a demonstration, we will give a few 
examples of polynomials involving fractional exponents.

CUBE ROOT OF POLYNOMIALS. 

282. The cube of a monomial, as a, is a", for (ay = a x a X a =za^. 
The cube of a binomial, a + h, is a" + Sa^J -f 3a&' -f b\ 
For, by actual multiplication, we have (a + ly = (a + li) (a + h) 
(a + I) = a" + Sa'b + ^a¥ -f V^. Since, then, the cube of a mo- 
nomial is a monomial, and the cube of a binomial a polynomial of four 
19 



218 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

terms, it follows that a polynomial of four terms is the least polynomial 
which can have an exact cube root. 

Knowing the third power of a binomial, we have only to reverse the 
process to obtain the cube root of the power. We see that the first 
term of the power is the perfect cube of a, and we know, from the man- 
ner in which a product is formed, that that term, a?, has been derived 
without reduction from the multiplication of the three factors of which 
the power is composed. If then we extract the cube root of o?, we 
know certainly that the root, a, is a term of the required root. Then a 
will be one of the extreme terms of the root; and, since the extreme 
terms of the root when cubed give powers that are irreducible with the 
other terms, it follows that the cube of a or a^ is to be taken from the 
given polynomial. After this subtraction, the remainder is 3a^6 + 
3a6^ + 1/, and it is plain that the second term of the root can be found 
by dividing the first term of the arranged remainder by 3a^, or by three 
times the square of the first term of the root. The remainder, 3a^6 + 
3aZ>2 .^ ^3 ^^^ ^e p^^ ^^^jgj, tl^g fQ^,j^ Qf ^3^2 ^ 3^ J + 12)&. If then 

we add three times the square of the first term of the root, three times 
the first power of this term by the second term of the root, and the 
square power of the second term of the root, together, and multiply the 
sum of the three terms by the last term of the root, we will obviously 
form the three parts of which the remainder is composed. The pro- 
cess, then, for extracting the cube root, is analogous to that for extract- 
ing the square root of a polynomial.

The root is set in the same horizontal line with the given polyno- 
mial, the cube of the first term is taken from the given polynomial, and 
the first term of the arranged remainder is divided by three times the 
square of the first term of the root, to obtain the second term of the 
root. Finally, immediately beneath the root is written, three times 
the square of the first term of the root, plus three times the product 
of the first and second terms of the root, plus the square of the second 
term of the root, and the product of the sum of these three terms by 
the last term of the root is taken from the first remainder. 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 219 

If the root be composed of three terms, a, h and c, we may repre- 
sent the algebraic sum of a and h by m. Then, let P be the poly- 
nomial whose root is a + h ■\- c, ytq will have V ^ (a -\- h -{■ cf = 
(m + cj = m^ -f- ^m^c -\- Smc" + c" = (a + bf + 3(a + bf c + S 
(a + b) e f c» = CT* -f 3a^i -f ^ab^ + i' + ^ah + Qabc + Z¥c + c^ 

The first four terms of this polynomial are the same as in the last ex- 
ample, and therefore their root, a -f i, can be found as in that example. 
After the cube of the sum of these terms has been taken from the given 
polynomial, the remainder may be placed under the form of | 3 (a + by 
-f 3 (a -f 6) c-f c^ I c. Then, having found the third term by dividing 
the first term, 3aV, of the arranged remainder, by 3a-, it is plain that tha 
remainder itself can be formed as before, by multiplying the last term 
found into three times the square of the sum of the other terms of the 
root, plus three times the fii-st power of the sum of the other terms into 
the last term, plus the square of the last term. 

Now, whatever may be the number of terms in the root, we may re- 
present the algebraic sum of all of them, except the last, by s. Sup- 
pose n to be the last term. Then P = (s -f ?i)' = s' + Ss^n + Ssn^ + ?i' : 
in which s represents the algebraic sum of any number of terms. If 
a is the first term of s, then the first term of the development of 3s^m, 
will be Sa^n. Hence, the divisor to find n is still three times the 
square of the first term. After s' has been subtracted from the poly- 
nomial, the remainder can be put under the form of (3s^ -|- Ssn + n^)«. 
Hence, whatever the number of terms in the root, the successive re- 
mainders can be formed just as when there are but two or three terms 
in the root. 

The following examples will illustrate the process.

220 FORMATION OP THE POWERS AND 



RULE. 

Arrange the given polynomial with reference to the ascending or de- 
scending powers of one of its letters. Extract the ciile root of the term 
on the left, and set the root on the same horizontal line toith the given 
polynomial on the right, and separated hy a vertical line. Subtract 
the cuhe of this first term of the root from the given polynomial, and 
hring down the remaining terms for the first remainder. Write three 
times the square of the first term of the root immediately beneath the 
place of the root. This will be the divisor to find all the other 
terms of the root. Divide the first term of the remainder by the divisor, 
and set the quotient, with its appropriate sign, on the right of the first 
term of the root, for the second term, of the root. Set, on the right of 
the divisor, three times the product of the first and second terms of the 
root, affected with its proper sign, plus the square of the second term of 
the root. Next, midtiply the algebraic sum of the three terms, thus 
formed, by the last term of the root, and subtract the product from the 
first remainder. Bring down the remaining terms for the second re- 
mainder, and divide the first term by the divisor. The quotient is the 
third term of the root. TaJce three times the square of the sum of the 
first two terms, and add to this three times the product of the algebraic 
sum of the first two terms by the third term, phis the square of the third 
term. Multiply the algebraic sum of the whole by the third term,, and. 
subtract the product from the second remainder. Bring doivn the re- 
maining terms from the third remainder. Find the fourth term of 
the root as before, and continue the process iintil all the terms of the root 
are found. 

Remarks. 

1st. When the exponent of the letter, according to which the ar- 
rangement is made, is positive in all the terms of the given polynomial, 
we know that the root is not exact, whenever the exponent of the as- 
sumed letter is less in the first term of any of the successive arranged 
remainders than it is in the divisor. 

2d. It is evident that the steps of the process, according to the rule, 
amount to nothing more than subtracting the cube of the algebraic sum 
of the terms of the root, when found, from the given polynomial. It 
may, therefore, sometimes save trouble to proceed thus. Subtract the cube 
of the first term from the given polynomial. Find the second term of 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 221 

the root according to the rule. Cube the algebraic sum of the two 
terms of the root, and subtract the result from the given polynomial. 
Find the third term, and subtract the cube of the algebraic sum of the 
first three terms of the root from the given polynomial. Proceed in 
this manner until we get a zero remainder, or until it becomes evident 
that the given polynomial is incommensurable.

QUANTITIES AFFECTED WITH FRACTIONAL EXPONENTS. 

28G. Suppose it be required to multiply a" into itself until it is taken 

three times as a factor. Then, by the rules for multiplication, «" X a" 

X a = a'-. This result is, evidently, the cube of a". Now, o-jmul- 

.1 J 3 

tiplied by itself once, gives a' X a' = a~ = a ; and ^/ a, multiplied by 

itself once, gives -J a X \/ a ^ yj a- = a. So, a', and \/a, arc cqui- 

valent expressions. The expression, a"-, then, which indicates the cube 

of a", also indicates the cube of sf a. The numerator of the fractional 
exponent denotes the power to which the quantity has been raised, and 

the denominator the degree of the root to be extracted. Taking a 

three times as a factor, we have a X a X a = a^"*"^"*"^ := a. Now, 
P 



226 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

the ^/ a, raised to the third power, will also plainly be a, because, 
from the definition of Involution and Evolution, it is evident that 
the latter undoes what the former has done. The root of any quantity 
raised to a power indicated by the index of the root, must then be the 

quantity itself. Hence, ( ^ a)* := a ; then, a= ^ a ; since we have 

seen that both a , and V a, when cubed, give a. In general, an = 

^a". Because aa, taken as a factor n times, gives d^Xa^Xa^ = 

a" " n = a", and V«"j raised to the n^^ power, is also a™. The 
fractional index may be regarded as denoting a poioer of a root. The 
denominator expresses the root, and the numerator the power. The 
denominator shows into how many equal factors, or roots, the given 
quantity is divided, and the numerator shows how many of these fac- 
tors have been taken. The fractional index may be considered to de- 
note tJie root 0/ a power, as well as the power of a root. Thus, a^ may 
either denote that the third power of the *J a has been formed, or that 
the square root of the third power has to be taken. Taking the former 
view, it indicates an executed operation ; taking the latter view, an 
unexecuted operation. 

In general, a" may be read the m^'^ power of the n^^ root of a, or the 
«."' root of the m}^ power of a. It is more convenient to read the ex- 
pression thus, a to the m divided by n, power ; or a, raised to a power 

denoted by the quotient of m, divided by n. So, ai is read, a to the 

P 

— power.

There are two consequences of notation by means of fractional expo- 
nents that deserve consideration. 1st. Any multiple of the numerator 
of a fractional exponent may be taken, provided an equal multiple of 

the denominator is also taken. Thus, az=a^ is also n=a.^^=a^=a"', &c. 

So, also, ai = a'l. The reason of this is plain; the increase of the 
denominator makes the equal roots or factors of the given quantity, a, 
smaller; but the numerator being increased just as much as is the 
denominator, the number of these smaller equal roots will be increased 
enough to make up for their diminution in magnitude. 2d. Since the 
fractional exponent may be exchanged for any other of equal value, it 

may be expressed in decimals. Thus, o^ = a"*^ ~ a-^. So, also, «•'» 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 22 1 

= a.037037+_ 

These decimal indices are called logarithms. The manner of calcu- 
lating them, and their use, will be shown hereafter. 



MULTIPLICATION OF QUANTITIES AFFECTED AYITII ENTIRE 
OR FRACTIONAL EXPONENTS. — MONOMIALS. 

287. Quantitities with fractional exponents must plainly be multi- 
plied in the same way as quantities affected with entire exponents. 
That is, the exponents of the same letter or letters in the multiplicand 
and multiplier must be added, and after the common letter or letters 
must be written tho.ee not common, with their primitive exponents. 

Let it be required to multiply a^ by o^. Then, a- is to be repeated 

a^, or a- times. Now, to repeat a-, a- times, we have only to add 
the exponents of multiplicand and multiplier, for the first exponent 

1 3 

denotes that a^ has been taken three times to produce the product, a-\ 
and the second exponent denotes that a^ has been taien four times in 

4 1 

the product, a^. Hence, a^ must enter seven times in the result of 

3 4 .7 

the multiplication of a- by a-, and that result must be written a^. To 

-1.1 i 1 

multiply a- by h, is to repeat a-, h times. Hence, a-xh = a^b. 

RULE. 

Multiply the coefficients together for the coefficient of the product. 
Reduce the exponents of the same letters in multiplicand and multiplier 
to the same denominator, add their numerators, and set their sum over 
the common denominator. Annex these letters to the new coefficient, 
and lorite after them all the letters ichich are not common to the multi- 
plicand and midfiplier. '-.

DIVISION OF QUANTITIES AFFECTED WITH FRACTIONAL 
AND ENTIRE EXPONENTS. — MONOMIALS. 

288. Since tbe exponents of tbe like letters are added in multiplica- 
tion, they must be subtracted in division. For, the object of division 
is to find a quantity called the quotient, which, when multiplied by 
the divisor, will give the dividend. Let it be required to divide a^ by 

a' ; then, we must find a quantity, which, when multiplied by a" will 



= a — a 



give a^. This quantity is plainly a'~, for a X a~ = a ^ 

3 

But the quantity found, a~ , has resulted from the subtraction of the 

exponent of a"' from 2 = 4, the exponent of a^. So, the result of the 

I 1 " i_ 1 J._ L ' i 

division of ci^ by a°^ must be a"' ", since a" '•Xa»=a'". When 
the denominators of the fractional exponents are diff"erent, the subtrac- 
tion can only be indicated, not performed, until they are reduced to 
the same index. If the exponents of the same letter in the divisor 
exceed that of the dividend, the exponent of that letter in the quotient 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 229 

will be negative. So, also, if there are any letters in the divisor not 
coiumon to the dividend, they must appear in the quotient, with their 
primitive exponents taken with a contrary sign ; else, when the quo- 
tient and divisor are multiplied together, these letters would enter in 
the product. 

RULE. 

Divide the coefficient of the dividend hy that of the divisor, the result 
icill he the coefficient of the quotient. Write after it all letters common 
to dividend and divisor, affected with exponents equal to the difference 
of their exponents in the dividend and divisor ; and, also, cdl the 
letters common to the dividend only, with their primitive exponents; 
and all common to the divisor only, icith their primitive exponents 
taken with a contrary sitjn.

230 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 



RAISING TO POWERS QUANTITIES AFFECTED WITH FRAC- 
TIONAL AND ENTIRE EXPONENTS. — MONOMIALS. 

289. Since, to raise a quantity to a power is only to multiply it by 
itself a certain number of times, the rule for the involution of quantities 
affected with any exponents whatever is deduced directly from the rule 
of multiplication. 

RULE. 

Raise the coefficient to the required power, and write after it all the 
literal factors affected with exponents equal to the product of their 
primitive exponents hy the exponent of the power. 

Thus, to raise a/ to the third power, is to take a three times as a 

'' \ i 2" 2+^+^ ^ 

factor. Then, (a")'' = a Xa''y.a =a " =a-^. The exponent 
of the result is the product arising from multiplying the exponent of 

1 m 

the quantity by 3, the exponent of the power. So, (Mx" y=(M.yx° , 

I J_ L 1 

because, (Ma;")" = M X M X Ma;"' +'""'''" + &c. If the given quan- 
tity be a fraction, it is raised to the required power by raising the 
numerator and denominator, separately, to that power : because, the 
power of a fraction is nothing more than the product of the fraction 
multiplied by itself a certain number of times ; and a fraction is mul- 
tiplied by itself by multiplying the numerators and denominators to- 
gether separately.

EXTRACTION OF ROOTS OF QUANTITIES AFFECTED WITH 
ENTIRE OR FRACTIONAL EXPONENTS. — MONOMIALS. 

290. To extract the m'** root of any quantity, a^, is to find a second 
quantity which, when raised to the m'^ power, will produce the given 
quantity, «■'. The extraction of a root is then just the reverse of raising 
to a power, and, of course, the reverse process must be pursued to find 

p p 

the root. The m^^ root of a^ must be am, because the m"* power of am 

is equal to a^. To raise a quantity, which has a coefficient, to a power, 
we first raise the coefficient to the indicated power, and write the new 
coefficient before the literal factors as the coefficient of the power. 
Hence, to extract the root of a quantity, which has a coefficient, we 
must first extract the root of the coefficient, and write it before the root 
of the literal factors. The on'^ power of Ma^ is (M)"'a''°', therefore, 
the m"" root of (M)"af"" must be Ma''. The ru* power of the fraction 

- = — . Hence, the wi"" root of -, — = — . That is, the m"" root of 

numerator and denominator must be taken separately. 



Extract the root of the coefficient, and write the result be/ore the lite- 
ral/actors affected with exponents equal to the quotient arising from 
dividing their primitive exponents hy the index of the root. If the co- 
efficient of the given monomial is not a perfect power of the degree of 
the root to he extracted, the operation is impossible. If the exponents 
of the literal factors are not divisible by the index of the root, the lite- 
ral factors win appear in the root with fractional exponents. The root 
of fractions is extracted by extracting the root of the numerator and 
denom in a tor separately.

It will be seen that decimal powers are smaller, and decimal roots 
greater, than the quantities themselves. 

CALCULUS OF RADICALS. 

291. Any quantity with a radical sign is called a radical quantity, 
or simply a radical. Thus, \/a, \^b, Vc^, are radical quantities, or 
radicals. 

The coefficient of a radical is the quantity prefixed to the radical 
sign, and it indicates the number of times, plus one, that the radical 
has been added to itself. Thus, 2y/a and m^/a, indicate that ^/ a has 
been added to itself once and vi — 1 times. When no coefficient is 
written, unity is understood to be the coefficient. Thus, >/ a = ly/a. 
When the indicated root can be exactly extracted, the radical is said to 
be commensurable or rational. Thus, ■v/4 and ^8 are rational radicals. 
When the indicated root cannot be exactly extracted, the radical is said 
to be incommensurable or irrational. Thus, ■s/2 and ^ 5 are irrational 
or incommensurable radicals. 

A root has been defined to be a quantity, which, taken as a factor 
a certain number of times, will produce the given quantity. An even 
root is a quantity, which, taken as a factor an eve7i number of times, 
will produce the given quantity. But no quantity taken an even 
number of times will produce a negative result. Hence the even root 
of a negative quantity is impossible. The indicated even roots of 
negative quantities are called imaginary quantities. Thus, y — 2, 
^ — 2, v' — 2, are imaginary quantities. Roots that are not imaginary 
are called real roots. 

The term rational is in contradistinction to irrational. 

The term real is in contradistinction to imaginary. 

A quantity may be real and not rational ; but no quantity can be 
rational or irrational and not be real. Thus, V2 is real, but not 
rational; but v'4 and \/2 are both real. 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 237 

292. It has been shown that all radicals may be changed into paren- 
thetical expressions ; the numerator of the exponent of the parenthesis 
denoting the power to which the quantity under the radical sign is 
raised, and the denominator of the exponent of the parenthesis 
denoting the index of the radical, or the degree of the root to be ex- 
tracted. Thus, v/a* may be changed into a-, and -(/a™ may bo 

changed into a". 

293. A simple radical is one, which, when changed into an equiva- 
lent parenthetical expression, has unity for the numerator of the 
exponent of the parenthesis. Thus ^a, i/a, &c., are simple radicals. 
A complex radical is one which has the quantity under the sign raised 
to some power different from unity. Thus, \/a', ^a", are complex 

3 ^ 

radicals, the equivalent parenthetical expressions («)"-, and (a)", having 

numerators different from unity. 

29-4. Radicals are said to be similar when they have the same index 

and the same quantity under the sign. Thus, 2yja and 3's/a are 

similar radicals. The ^ a and ^a are not similar, because, though 

the quantities under the radical signs are the same, the indices of the 

radicals are different. The s/ a and \/6 are dis.similar, because the 

quantities under the signs are different. 

295. Similar powers of the same quantity can be added by adding 
their coefficients. Thus, 2a^ -f 3a^ = 5a^ ; because, since the literal 
factors are the same, they may be represented by the same letter, x. 
Then, 2a* -f 3a^ = 2x + 3x = Sx, and replacing x by its value a^, we 
have the sum of the two quantities equal to ba^. For a like reason, 
similar powers of the same quantity may be subtracted from each other, 
by taking the difference between their coefficients and uniting this 
difference as the coefficient of the common quantity. Thus, 5a' — 
2a» = 3a^ 

296. In the same way, similar radicals may be added or subtracted, 
2s/ a-{- •y/a = 3v/a. For, make V a = a; ; then 2v/a-|- v/« = 2x + 
X = Zx = Z^ a. So, also, 2s/a — y/a = y/a. 

297. The calculus of radicals shows how radicals may be operated 
upon algebraically — added, subtracted, multiplied, &c., &c. 

These algebraic operations must be in accordance with certain prin- 
ciples, which both modify and facilitate them. It would require an 
extended treatise to embrace all the principles of the calculus of 
radicals. A few of the most important only are given in this work. 



238 FORMATION OF THE TOWERS AND 

First Principle. 

298. Any parenthetical expression, composed of several factors, may 
be decomposed into as many new parenthetical expressions as there are 

p p p p 

factors. Thus, (aZ>c)T = (a)q (5)q (c)q . 

For by the rules for raising a monomial affected with any exponent, 

fractional or entire, to a power, each factor has to be separately raised 

P P £ P 

to the indicated power. Hence, (cihc)i — (a)q (b)i (c)q . And, in 

p P L H 

like manner, (a'"i"c'')q = (a'")q' (6")i (c')'' • 

299. This principle has an important application in the case of simple 

I I I 1 I 

radicals. For (abed)'" = y abed, is also equal to (a)" (&)n (cf {dy 

or to ^a . y 6 . ^c ^ d. Hence, ^ abed = </a ^b ^c ^ d. That 
is, the n"" root of the product of any number of factors is equal to the 
product of the n"* roots of these factors. 

300. This property of radicals is used for two distinct purposes. 
1st. To simplify radicals. Let it be required to simplify or reduce 

V 75a^c. We see that the quantity under the sign Iba^c, can be de- 
composed into two factors, 25a^ and 3c, and that the first is a perfect 
power of the degree of the root to be extracted. Then, V l^a^c = 
v'25a^ X 3c, which is also, by the property just demonstrated, :=: 
v/25^2 v/3^ = 5a V3Z In like manner, ^l^^c = V^^ X ^7= 
2rt ^c. Then, to simplify or reduce a radical, we have the following 

RULE. 

Decompose the quantity under the sign into two factors, one of which 
shall be a perfect poioer of the degree of the root to be extracted. Ex- 
tract the root of the perfect power, and write this root before the incom- 
mensurable factor. 

301. 2d. The property, that the li"" root of the product of any number 
of factors is equal to the product of the n"" roots of those factors, is also 
used to make radicals similar which appear dissimilar. Then, after 
they have been made similar, they may be operated upon algebraically, 
added, subtracted, &c., like simple algebraic expressions. 

Thus, -J ^a^c and m-J c appear to be dissimilar. But y/ 4:a^c =^ 
\/4a^ . c = \/4«^ -y/c = 2iasf c. Hence, if it be required to add \/\d^c 
and m v" f ? we may represent %/ c by .r, and the sum of the two quantities 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 239 

will be 2ax + mx or (2a + m) x. Now replace x by its value -J c, and we 
have ^/ia^c -{■ m-J c =^ (2a + m)-sfc. In like manner, 26^8aV 
and — 2ac^c^V^, appear to be dissimilar. But, 26y8aV = 
2b^Sa^c' x~? = 26^8^ Xj/7 = ^achV^, and — lacVTV' = 
— 2ac^ 6^(c^) = — 2ac .e^ 6« V c^ = — 2ao6 ^7. Hence, 26 ^ 8aV — 
2ac^<?b^ = 2ac6v/c^. To operate upon dissimilar radicals, we bave 
then the following 

RULE. 

First make the radicals similar, then represent the common radical 
hy X, or conceive it to he so represented, and operate upon the new radi-

The following examples will afford illustrations of the two applica- 
tions of the principle, that ^abc, &c. = ^a . ^b ^ c, &c. For the

The whole difficulty in solving these examples consists in finding the 
incommensurable factor common to all the radicals. 



Second Principle. 

302. The Ji"" root of the quotient of two quantities is equal to the 

quotient of their w* roots. That is, \ / — = — — 

V 6 «/6- 

For, to raise a fraction to any power, we raise the numerator and 
denominator, separately, to the required power. Hence, to extract any 
root, as the n'", the root of each term of the fraction must be extracted 
separately. 

This principle is used in extracting the roots of fractions. 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 241 

Third Principle. 

303. The mn^^ root of any quantity is e(|ual to the m^^ root of thy 

n^ root of that quantity. That is, '":y~a = k/ ^ya. 

A quantity, a, may be raised to the sixth power by first squaring a, 
and then cubing the result. Hence, the sixth root of a® might be 
extracted by first extracting the square root, and then extracting the 
cube root of the result. So, a may be raised to the wiJi"" power by 
first raising it to the ?<'" power, and then raising the result to the m"" 
power. Hence, the m?*"' root can plainly be extracted by taking first 
the n"", and then the m"" root, in succession. 

304. This principle is of great importance, and extensive applica- 
tion. It is used to extract high roots in succession, whenever their 
indices can be decomposed into factors. 



Thus, V256(W^=:\/y"2o 



m^iW = ^ l()a^6« = \a^V 



All even roots, and roots that are multiples of 3, can be extracted in 
succession. The sixth root is equal to the cube root of the square root. 
The eighth root is equal to the fourth root of the square root, or it can 
be found by extracting the sfiuare root three times. But the fifth root, 
seventh root, eleventh root, &c., cannot be extracted successively. 

When the principle can be applied, we begin by extracting the low- 
est root first. The index of the radical must be decomposed into its 
prime factors, and the root corresponding to the lowest factor ought to 
be first extracted. It frequently happens that the factors are equal. 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Extract the eighth root of 256a'i^ 



2. Extract the sixth root of Tl^a}%^\

8. Required "^ a'^h'K Ans. ah\ 

9. Required ^-^IZly^iHj^. Ans. 2,a^l\ 
In this example, extract the s"" root first. 

Fourth Principle. 

305. The coefficient of a radical may be passed under the radical 
sign by raising it to a power indicated by the index of the radical. 
That is, PVa = 7P"a. For, P^yP^; henc e, P V«'= 7P" 7'"^; 
but, by the first principle, V~^ 7^= VP"a- Therefore, P7a = 
VP'^ 

306. The fourth principle is, obviously, just the converse of the 
first principle. The latter enables us to pass a factor outside of the 
radical ; the former, to place a factor under the radical. The fourth 
principle is frequently used in the differential calculus. It has two 
applications in Algebra: 1st. The approximate value of incommen- 
surable roots can sometimes be found more exactly by means of this 
principle. Thus, |n/T= n/(|)'^. 7 = V^^s = | : true to within less 
than \ . A nearer approximation to the value of the expression has 
been found in this instance by passing the coefficient under the radical. 
But, for such expressions as | ^/ 2, f ^/ 5, nothing is gained by passing 
the coefficient under the radical. 

2d. The fourth principle may be used instead of the first, or in con- 
nection with the first, in making radicals similar which appear dissimi- 
lar. Thus, 9av/6, and v'^lo^ are dissimilar, until either 9a is 
passed under the radical, or 81a^ is passed without. Sometimes it is 
difficult to employ the first principle to make radicals similar, because 
it is not easy to perceive the incommensurable factor common to all the 
radicals. But there is no difficulty in employing the fourth principle. 
Pass all the coefficients under their respective radical signs, and then 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 243 

decompose the numerical and literal factors into their prime factors. 
If the radicals can be made similar, common factors will become appa- 
rent after the decomposition into prime factors. Let it be required to 
ascertain whether 2a ^ab^, and h^a^b^ are similar. The equivalent 
expressions are ^Ha'^b^, and ^ a^b^. The two radicals have, then, a 
common factor, a^b^, under the sign. This common factor can be de- 
composed into two others, one of which is a perfect power of the degree 
of the root to be extracted, and the other incommensurable. The in- 
commensurable factor may be made a new radical, and the given ex- 
pressions being decomposed into factors, one of which is this incom- 
mensurable factor, will be similar. We have, in accordance with this 
rule, 2ay^b'= ^J^ -^ ^"8^^ ^IdJ^ = 2ab^7d/, and bV^^ 

= V^^= ^'^^ab' = ab^ab\ 

Take, as a second example, 7 V x^, and x ^24:01 x1/ ; by passing 7 
and X under the radical signs, we have ^2A0\x^if, and v/2401a;*^. 
Hence, V2401a;^ is a common factor, and the given expressions reduce 
to Ixi/ xif and lx\/ xy, and are not similar, since they have no com- 
mon incommensurable factor. We have, then, a simple process for 
ascertaining whether radical expressions can be made similar. 



RULE. 

Pass the coefficients of the different radicals tinder their respective 
signs, and then examine whether there is a common incommensurable 
factor. Jf so, the radicals vxay be made similar by taJcing the incom- 
mensurable factor as a new radical. Write before it, for new coeffi- 
cients, the roots of the commensurable factors of the respective expres- 
sions, and we loill have a series of new radical expressions, all similar. 
If there is no common incommensurable factor, the radical expressions 
are not similar. 

EXAMPLES. 

1. Add together 2a ^Jc^ and ^c¥jb?. 



Then , 2aybc^= V4:a^_bf= sf\a\^>Jbc and ^cb^s/b&= >/96V = 
s/^V& -Jbc. Hence, sfbc is a common incommensurable factor, and 
the sum is {2ac -f- 35c) s/ be.

Hence, y/o.S.a, or \/15a, is a common incommensurable factor, and 
the sum of the two expressions is (Qah + 24a) \/ 15a. 

4. Add together V90 and V'MO. 



y/90=V3^5.2 and v/810 = n/3\2.5. Hence, v/2.5 is the

Fifth Principle. 

307. Any factor may be passed without a parenthetical expression, 
by multiplying its exponent by the exponent of the parenthesis. 

p mp p 

Thus, (a'"hc) q = a 1 (6c)<i . 

L 1LP Jl P . n 

For, (a"'hc) i = a'ih'ic'i, since each term has to be raised to the — 

9 

nip p p 

power. And, by separating into factors, we have at x tqci, which is 

mp p 

also equal to a •) (hc)^ . 

If there is more than one term within the parenthesis, any term or 
a factor of any term may be passed out, by dividing all the terms by 
the expression to be passed out, and then writing that expression out- 
side of the parenthesis, with its primitive exponent multiplied by the 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 245 

exponent of the parenthesis. Let it be required to pass a" without the 

parenthesis (a^S + c)i. This may be written \a'°lb + — I p= (a"'J)i 

^ p g p 

— ai (fZ)^. In which d = h -\ — ~ or h -{- a-'^c Hence, (a"'Z> + c)5

It matters not how many terms there may be within the parenthesis ; 
they may be all represented by a single letter, after they have been 
divided by the factor to be passed without. The foregoing demonstra- 
tion will then be applicable.

Any number of terms may be passed without, by representing them

transfer has been made.

The last example shows that any factor affected with a negative ex- 
ponent may be made to appear with a positive exponent in the other 
terms of the parenthesis. This transformation is used in the differential 
calculus when it is desired to change a negative into a positive exponent. 

It is evident that the fifth principle is only the more extended appli- 
cation of the first principle. 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 247 

Sixth Principle. 

308. Any factor may be passed within a parenthesis, by multiplying 
its exponent by the reciprocal of the parenthesis. 

Because, to pass it out again, we must multiply its new exponent by 
the exponent of the parenthesis, and when its new exponent has been 
formed as directed, the factor, after it has been passed out again, will 

p ^ p. 

be afifected with its primitive exponent. Thus, a'"(i)'» =(ai'Z>)'i. 

Because, when av is passed out again, the expression will become

Ans. (a-j- 1)^ 

It is evident that the sixth principle is only the more extended ap- 
plication of the fourth principle. 



Seventh Principle. 

309. The denominator of the exponent of a parenthetical expression may 
be multiplied by any quantity, provided vre raise the quantity within 

p 
the parenthesis to a power denoted by the multiplier. Thus, (0)1 = 

Z pp JL '^ -^ JLJL 

(a'")""'. For (a)T = an, and (a"')""! = W'l = a ■) . Hence, (a) i = (a'")°"i. 

If there is more than one term within the parenthesis, their algebraic 
sum may be represented by a single letter, and the foregoing demon- 
stration is, therefore, applicable to all kinds of parenthetical expres- 
sions. 

810. The seventh principle has two applications. 1st. It is used to 
cause complex radicals (or parenthetical expressions with the nume- 
rators of their exponents different from unity), to be alFected with ex- 
ponents having a common denominator. 

Thus, (a + by^ and (a -f i)^, can be changed in accordance with the 

3 4 

principle into the equivalent expressions ( (<x -f- bf)*^ and ((a-f 6)'^)^. 

We see that a second parenthesis has been written within each pa- 
renthesis ; and we see, also, that the exponent of the first new paren- 
thesis is the quotient arising from the division of 6, the least common 
multiple of the denominators of the exponents of the given parentheses, 
by the denominator of the exponent of the first given parenthesis. 
The exponent of the second new parenthesis is the quotient arising 
from dividing the same least common multiple, 6, by the denominator 
of the exponent of the second given parenthesis. In like manner, 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 249 

2 3 . -3_ 

(a + J)3 and (a + 5)* may be changed into ((a + by)^' and 

Hence, to cause parenthetical expressions to be affected with expo- 
nents having a common denominator, we have the following 



RULE. 

Take the least common multiple of all the denominators of the ex- 
ponents of the parentheses, and divide that multiple hy the denominator 
of the ej-ponent of every parenthesis. The several quotients will indi- 
cate the power to which the quantity within their respective parentheses 
must he raised. 



1. Change [a + £)"> and (a H- J)""", into equivalent parenthetical ex- 
pressions, the denominators of whose exponents shall be the same.

Ans. ( (a + ^)° ) '"'' and (a + t)""". 
JL -P. 

2. Change (a -f t)™* and (a -f- i)""-, into equivalent expressions. 

Ans. ( (rt -f hy ) ■»"■' and ( (a + Z^)" ) ■»^°. 

311. 2d. But the most important application of the seventh prin- 
ciple, is in reducing simple radicals to a common index. 

* ?. — — J -. _ 

Thus, since a" = o*", or \/ a = ^a^, and a = a", or %/ a = -J/o', 

it is plain that \/a and ■i^a, can be reduced to a common index. So, 

^a and ^a, may be changed into the equivalent radicals '"^^a"' and 

'"^a". In each instance, the power to which the quantity under the 

radical is raised is indicated by the quotient arising from dividing the 

least common multiple of the indices of all the radicals by the index 

of the radical under consideration. 



RULE. 

Form the least common mxdtiple of the indices of all the radicals. 
Raise the quantity under each radical to a power indicated hy the quo- 
tient arising from dividing the least common multiple hy the index 
of the radical under consideration.

Reduce v' a, i/ «j and ^/ a, to same index. The least common mul- 
tiple is 12, and the three quotiente^ ^'i^ ^> V^ ^ ^> ^°^ V' = ". 
Then the equivalent radicals are -7 a*, J^ a^, and '-^ al

and 2520/^, 

It will be seen that simple radicals are changed into complex by the 
operation of reduction to a common index. 



Eighth Principle. 

312. Any factor of the index of a complex radical may be sup- 
pressed, provided, (he same factor is suppressed in the exponent of 
the power to which the quantity under the sign is raised. That is, 
"7 a" = V a. 

For, '"7 a'" = (a)"^ = («)" = \^ a-

This principle is just the converse of the last, and reverses the results 
of the last. It is used to simplify complex radicals, and frequently 
reduces them to simple radicals.

313. There are two consequences of the last two principles, of con- 
siderable importance. 1st. Whenever it is required to extract a root 
of a complex radical, which is a multiple of the exponent of the quan- 
tity under the sign, the extraction can be indicated by suppressing the 
exponent under the sign, and multiplying the index of the radical by 
the quotient, arising from dividing the index of the required root by 



252 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

the exponent under the sign. Thus, let it be required to take the 
sixth root of \/ «*, the result will he y a. For, the sixth root of v/ a? 

3 1 3 1 

is equal to (a~)'' = a = a"* = i/ a. In like manner, the j^Jt"" root 

n _1_ n 1 

of iy"a" = ''v^- For the j^n"" root of V a" = (a")?" = av^ = aP" = 
Va- These results have plainly been formed in accordance with the 
rule. 

314. 2d. Whenever it is required to raise a simple radical to a power 
which is a factor of the index of the radical, the operation can be per- 
formed by dividing the index of the radical by the exponent of the 
power, and writing the quotient as the index of the radical instead 
of the old index. Thus, let it be required to raise Va to the square 
power. The result will be %/a; for the second power of the sixth root 

X 1 1 _ 

of a is («^)^ = a^^:^a^ = V a. So, likewise, the Ji"" power of '^ a 

\_ "J. 

z= :^ a. For the 'n}^ power of V • a = (aP»)" = op" = ap =-y a.

TO MAKE SURDS RATIONAL BY MULTIPLICATION. 
CASE I. 

Monomial Surih. 

315. Suppose the given surd is ^ b ; this is equivalent to i° . Now, 

it is required to multiply i^ by such a quantity as will make it rational. 
Since the surd will be rational when the numerator of the fractional 
exponent is exactly divisible by the denominator j and, since, in multi- 
plication, we add the exponents of the same literal factors, the multiplier 

of J " must be h, affected with such an exponent, that, when added to 

— , the sum of the two exponents will be a whole number. Call x the 
n 

unknown exponent of the multiplier, then x -\ = 1, or .r = 1

n — 1 "-=-' 1 ^jil 

= . Hence, the multiplier is i " , and we see that h'' X h " 

= b, & rational product. Had we placed x -\ =2, and found the 

multiplier under this hypothesis, the product would have been h^. 
But, when it is required to make the surd rational, and of the first 
degree, the sum of the primitive exponent, and the unknown exponent, 
must be placed equal to unity. 

Let it be required to find a multiplier which will make ?/■* rational.

CASE II. 

317. To find a multiplier that will make rational an expression, con- 
sisting of a monomial surd, connected with rational terms, or consisting 
of two monomial surds. 

Let it be required to make rational ^/p ■}- y/q hj multiplication. 
From the principle demonstrated in Case 1., it is plain that y/jj can 
only be made rational by multiplying it by v^^j, and V q can only be 
made rational by multiplying it by Vq- But, unless v/p and <>/ q, in 
the multiplier, are connected by the sign minus, there will be two terms 
in the product remaining irrational and unreduced. Hence, the mul- 
tiplier must have the minus sign between its terms. 

Thus, 



\/p + Vq 
Vp — Vq 




p-\- s/pq 

— Vpq- 


-9 



p — q 

If the given expression is-Jp — Vq, the multiplier must be, for a 
like reason, Vp -}- V q- 

If the given expression contain but one monomial surd, and is of the 
form J) -f s/g-, it may be written y/p^ + Vq, and reduced, as before, 
by multiplying by Vp^ — V q- So, p — Vq may be written Vp'' — 
\/q, and may be made rational by multiplying it by Vj^" + y/q. 

It matters not how many terms may be under the radical, or how 
many rational terms may be outside of the radical, the foregoing proces- 
ses will still be applicable ; because the sum of the quantities under the 
sign may be represented by a single letter, and the sum of the rational 
terms outside of the radical may be represented by a single letter. 
Thus, a -\- b + -v/m — n = p + Vq = V p^ + V q. Multiply now 
by Vp^ — Vq, and replace p and q by their values. The result will 
be (a + Vf — (w — ii). 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 257 

Let it be required to make y/ p + v^g rational by multiplication. 
The operation is as follows : 

p + Vfq 

+ Vp'f- + ? __ _ 
— Vfq — Vp(l 

p -j- (J = Product. 

The multiplier, to make ^j^ rational, must be ^jr ; and the multi- 
plier, to make ^q rational, must be ^ qK But, after multiplication 
^y Vl^ 4- ^^2^ there remained two uncancelled surds, "</p^q and 
V q^p, and these could only be cancelled by multiplying the given ex- 
pression by — Vpq- 

To make rational ^'p — ^ q, the multiplier must be ^ p^ + ^ (f 
-\- \/pq. The multiplier, then, in every case, is the sum of the cube 
roots of the squares of the quantities diminished or augmented by the 
cube root of the product of the two quantities, according as the sign 
between the surds is plus or minus. 

Let it be required to make Vp -\- >/ q rational. The operation is 
as follows :

Or the operation may be performed iu this manner : 

^P + v/ ? = Given surd, 

Vp — y/ q = First multiplier, 

VY— v/5'= /P— /?= First Product, 

v'i> + -s/ q = Second multiplier, 
ji — q=^ Second product. 

Any two monomial surds, whose common index is some power of 2, 
may be reduced in the same manner. And, since each multiplication 



1258 FORMATION OF THE POWERS AND 

<;ive.s a product containing two surds, witli a common index one-lialf as 
great as the common index previous to multiplication, it is evident 
that the number of multiplications will he indicated by the exponent 
of the power of 2 in the primitive index, common to the surds given to 
be reduced. 

Thus, %/j> -}- \/<2 can be reduced by three multiplications, since 
8 = 2'. And lyp + v/<? can be reduced by four multiplications, 
.since IQ = 2\ _ _ 

The reduction of the ^p -f ^q, and i^p -f [/q, is as follows : 

v/p -r \/'J = Given surd, 

v/p — x/? = ^i^'^*- multiplier, 

VF — V? = v/p"— \/7= First product, 

i/jJ + V? — Second multiplier, 

l/p^ — X/<i= s/p — Vl — Second product,

i/¥+ V~q = Third multiplier, 
v/p — y/q =: Third product, 
Vp + \/<? = Fourth multiplier, 
p — q = Fourth product. 

We have this process for the reduction of -i/p + %/q.

Vp^ — V^ + l/m = Second multiplier,

All expressions composed of two surds, whose common index is a 
multiple of 2 and 3, may be reduced in a similar manner. 

Thus, ^^p + '^q = Given expression, 

y/p — v/g- = First multiplier, 
Vi? — ^q = First product, 
%/p + V? = Second multiplier, 
^p — \/q = Second product, 
Vp — Vq + Vpq = Third multiplier, 
p — q = Third product. 

All expressions composed of two surds, whose common index is some 
power of 3, may be reduced in the same manner as l/p + l/q. 
Take as an example 

y/p + ^q = Given expression, 

^P + V?— Vpq= First multiplier, 

Vf -f V? = VF-^ yq~= First product, 

Vp^ + s/q^ — Vpq = Second multiplier, 
p + 5' = Second product. 

Take as a second example, %/p + %/q. 

Then, %/p + %/q = Given expression, 

%/f + ^?— \/pq= First multiplier, 

X/F-^- \/?^ = Vp+ Vq = First product, which can be 

reduced as before. 

The reduction of l/p +1/ q, is more difficult than any of the pre- 
ceding? reductions.

same vertical column.

p + 2' = Product. 

All expressions composed of two monomial surds, may be rendered 
rational when the surds have a common index. The amount of diffi- 
culty attending the reduction depends altogether upon the index. 
When the index is some power of 2, the reduction is very easy. But 
when it is 7, 11, 13, 17, &c., the reduction is difficult. 

When an expression is given to be reduced, we must first examine 
the factors of the common index, and make our reduction correspond 
to those factors. 

Thus, let it be required to render rational l^p + l^g-. The factors 
of 15 are 3 and 5 ; we must then reduce the expression by the- first 
multiplication, so that the common index of the result shall be 5. 

Thus, v'p + v/? = Given expression, 

15/p _|_ y~f— '4/pq= First multiplier, 

'5/pi~_|, '.^^ = ^p -f- ^q, which can be reduced as before. 

To reduce the ^^/p+ ^^'q, we must use such a multiplier as will leave 
a common index, 5, in the product. 

Thus, Vp + Vl, 



]yp^ — 10/^2 = s/p — ^q^ which can be made rational as 
before. 

Let it be required to reduce v'p + X/q. 

The factors of the index are 3 (2)1 Therefore, we must first get 
rid of the factor, 3, and reduce the expression to a common index, 
(2)' or 8.

EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT OF A MONOMIAL SURD 
CONNECTED AVITU A RATIONAL TERM, OR OF TWO MONO- 
MIAL SURDS. 

321. Before we proceed to extract the root, it will be necessary to 
demonstrate three principles upon which the extraction depends. 

First Principle. 

The square root of a quantity cannot consist of the sum of two parts, 
one of which is rational and the other irrational. 

For, if possible, suppose \/ a = x + y/y. Then, by squaring both 
members, we get a = x^ + 2xi/y + y- From which, ^/y = 

^ . That is an irrational quantity equal to a rational one, 

which is absurd. But the absurdity has not resulted from an error in 
the analysis, and must, therefore, be in the condition. 

Second Principle. 

When the first member of any equation contains a monomial surd, 
connected with rational terms, and the second member is made up in 
the same manner, the rational quantities in the first member are equal 
to the rational quantities in the second, and the irrational quantities in 
the two members are respectively equal also. 

Let a 4- \/b = X + i/i/, then a = x, and ■</ 6 = -yy. 

For if a be not equal to a;, let a = a: ± m. Substitute this for a 
in the equation, and there results x±m + v/^= x + y/y, or ± m 
-f y/b = \/y, which is impossible, (principle first.) Therefore, it is 
absurd to suppose that a is unequal to x. Hence, a = x, and the 
equation becomes a + s/h = a -\- sf y, or by cancelling a, s/h — yjy. 
23 



266 FORMATION OF THE TOWERS AND 

Third Principle. 



If 



\ / « + \/^ = a; + ^y, then will y / a — ^/h = x — -^y. 
For, by squaring the first equation, we get a -\- ^/h = x^ -\- 2x\/y 

From which a = x^ + y (2), and ^h = 2x^/2/ (3)- 

Subtract (3) from (2), and we have a — ^Y= x" — 2x^y'+ y (4). 

Extracting the square root of both members of (4), we have 

\ / a — y/h = x — ■s/ y. 

This last equation has been correctly deduced from the equation 
v/a + ^h = cc + y/y, so that it is a true equation, provided that the 
equation from which it is deduced is true. 

322. The foregoing principles enable us to deduce a formula for the 
extraction of the square root of an expression made up of two mono- 
mial surds, or of one monomial surd connected with rational terms. 



Let, \J a + ^T= X + ^y. (1). 

Then, \/ a — ^T= x — ^Y- (2)- 

Squaring (1) and (2), there results 

a + Vh = x' + 2x^yj- y. (3). 
a — ^h = x^ — 2xy/Y^y. (4). 

Adding (3) and (4), and cancelling (2) in the result, we get 
a=^x^ -^ y. (5). 

Multiplying (1) and (2), we get ^a^ — h — x' — y. (6). 



Adding (5) and (6), we get " "^ '^f ^ = x\ (7). 



Subtracting (6) from (5), we get "^ = y. (8).

there results \ /^Liu^^^^ln^ _ x. (9).

and s/ '-^.f-' -Vj. (10). 

By adding (9) and (10), we get the value oi x + y/y^ov of the 
equivalent, \/«+ n/^- 

By subtracting (10) from (9), tvc get the value of x — ^i/, or the 
equivalent \ / a — \/^ 

Hence we have, by performing these operations, the two formulaJ,

^/a _ ^T= \/ » + ^^^ - \/"UZ^^I^. (B). 

By using the double sign =b, we may unite (A) and (B) in one 
formula. 



We will now show the use of the formula?. 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Let it be required to extract the square root of 9 + v/45. Then, 
by comparing 9 + ^/\:b with a + v/6, the quantity whose root is to 
be extracted in (A), we see that a = 9 and h = 45. 



Hence,

This result can be verified; for, squaring it, we get 6 + 2^18 + 3

3. Required the square root of 9 — v^56. 

Then, a = 9 and h = 56. Formula (B) must be used.

We see that the square root of an expression containing an imagi-

of two expressions, involving imaginary quantities, may be real and even 
rational. The formulas (A) and (B^t are generally applied to expres-

IMAGINARY QUANTITIES. 

323. Any expression whatever, made up of monomial surds and 
rational terms, or monomial surds only, may be rendered rational by 
repeated multiplications. The few examples given will show the man- 
ner in which these multiplications must be made. No general rule can 
be given in regard to them. There is a particular class of monomial 
surds, which, when rendered rational, present some differences from 
other surds in regard to their algebraic signs. These are imaginary 
surds. 

An imaginary quantity has been defined to be the even root of a 
negative quantity, because no quantity, taken as a factor an even num- 
ber of times, can give a negative result. Thus, y/ — a, %/ — o, 
%/ — o, ^;/ — a, are imaginary quantities. 



EXTRACTION OF ROOTS. 271 

If tlie indicated root be of the 2ni"' degree, then ^^ — a may be 
written ^^a ^^ — 1 = 6\/ — 1. In which, h represents the 27H*'' 
root of a, whether that be rational or irrational. And we see that all 
imaginary quantities may be decomposed into two factors, one of which 
is an indicated even root of minus unity, and the other of which is 
real, and sometimes rational. 

This decomposition must always be first effected previous to opera- 
ting upon imaginary quantities. 

To square v/ — «; "we first write the expression v/o v/ — 1 ; these 
two factors will both drop the radical when squared. Hence, (^Z — a)^ 
= W^ V-^^= («) (- !)=—«. 



So, also, (y—of = (v/a v/— 1)' = (ds/a) (—1 y/—l) =

(v/— af=(ya ^— iy=(a' ^a) (+^/— l) = aV- 



(v/— a/=(v/a v/- !/=(«') (- 1) = — «'• 

The table shows that tlie even powers of imaginary monomials are 
always real, and that their signs are alternately plus and minus.

braic signs.

And we see that, in division, like signs produce plus, and unlike 
signs produce minus. It would seem that, since the rule for the 
signs in division is different from that in multiplication, the product 
of the quotient by the divisor might not give the dividend. But any 
of the preceding quotients can be readily verified.

An examination of the foregoing results will show some properties 
of imaginary quantities. 

1. Real, and even rational results, may be obtained by the ordinary 
algebraic operations upon imaginary quantities. 

2. Two monomial imaginaries raised to an even power, will always 
give a rational result. 

3. Two monomial imaginaries multiplied together, or divided, the one 
by the other, will always give a real result. 

4. A monomial imaginary connected by the sign, plus or minus, with 
one or more rational terms, and then raised to any power, will give at 
least one imaginary term in the result. 

5. Any expression involving one or more monomial imaginaries, may 
be rendered real by one or more multiplications. 



276 EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 

827. An equation, involving a single unknown quantity, is said to 
be of the second degree, wlicn the highest exponent of that unknown 
quantity in any one term is 2. Thus, x^ -\- x = m, and x^ -{- a = h, 
are equations of the second degree with one unknown quantity. 

An equation, involving two unknown quantities, is said to be of the 
second degree when the highest sum of the exponents of the unknown 
quantities in any term is equal to 2. Thus, xt/ = ?h, a;^ -f ?/ = ??, and 
y'^ -{- x=p are equations of the second degree with two unknown 
quantities. For they may be written, x'j/' = in, x^if -f ^ ^= n, and, 
y^x^ -f a- = w, and, thei'efore, come within the definition. 

We will begin with equations of the second degree, with a single 
unknown quantity. These are divided into two classes, complete and 
incomplete. A complete equation of the second degree, with a single 
unknown quantity, is one which contains the second and first powers 
of the unknown quantity. Thus, a-^ + a = 0, clx^ + x = m, and 
ax'^ -f hx = c, are complete equations of the second degree, with one 
unknown quantity. There may or may not be other terms, besides 
those involving the unknown quantity. The first and second powers 
of the unknown quantity may or may not have coefficients different 
from unity. 

An incomplete equation of the second degree is one containing the 
second power only of the unknown quantity, and it may or may not 
involve terms in which the unknown quantity does not enter. The 
unknown quantity may or may not be affected with a coefiicient diffe- 

rent from unity. Thus, ax^ = x^, x^ -\- m == n, ~ — h c = — q are 

incomplete equations of the second degree. Equations of the second 
degree, with one unknown quantity, are frequently called quadratic 
equations, because the unknown quantity is raised to the second 
degree, or squared. 

INCOMPLETE EQUATIONS. 

328. We will first examine incomplete equations. 

hx^ 
The general form of such equations is ax^ \- d =^e. By 

transposition and reduction, we get (ca — h')x'^ = ce — cd, or c'^ = 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 2i( 

~ -^ = q, by substitutinsr for the known terms in the second 

ca — 6 

member a single term, equal to them in value. Hence, ever}- incom- 
plete equation may be reduced to two terms, and the equation be 
placed under the form of x^ = q. Owing to this circumstance, incom- 
plete equations are sometimes placed in the class of hinomial equations, 
or equations involving but two terms. 

There is no difficulty in solving the equation x^ = q. The square 
root of the first member will give us x ; but if we extract the square 
root of the first member, we must extract that of the second also, or 
the equality will be destroyed. Extracting, then, the root of both 
members, we have dti x = zt: ^/ q. We have prefixed the double sign 
to both members, because this equation, when squared, must give back 
the original equation, x^ = q, from which it was derived, and either 
+ X or — X, when squared, will give + x'^, and either + V q, or 
— ^/q will, when squared, give q. 

The value of the unknown quantity, or the root of the equation, as 
it is generally called, has been defined to be that which, substituted 
for the unknown quantity, will satisfy the equation, that is, make the 
two members equal to each other. We sec that an incomplete equa- 
tion of the second degree has two values, numerically ccjual, but 
aff"ectcd with different signs. Either value or root will satisfy the 
equation, for the result of the substitution of either V*/, or — y/q for 
X, in the given equation, will he q z=q. We have prefixed the double 
sign to both members, but it is usual to prefix it only to the root. In 
that cape, however, we must understand that the sign of x is not neces- 
sarily positive, it being afi'ected with the positive sign only, when it 
corresponds to the positive root. It becomes, then, necessary to have 
some notation to distinguish the values. This we will do by dashes. 
The X that corresponds to the positive root we will write x' ; and the 
X that corresponds to the negative root we will write x". The fir.st is 
read x prime, and the second, x second. It will be shown that a com- 
plete equation has two roots, generally unequal in value. We will 
also distinguish these roots or values by writing them x', and x". Some 
equations of high degrees have three, four, &c., values. These will be 
written x', x", x", x^'', &c., and read x prime, x second, x third, x 
fourth, and so on. 

To solve an incomplete equation, it must first be put under the form 
of x'^ = q. That is, all the known terms must be transferred to the 
second member, and the coefficient of x"^ must be made pins unity, if 
24 



278 EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 

not already so, by dividing both members by the coefficient of x-. 
After the equation has been put under the form of x" = q, extract 
the square root of both members. 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Solve the equation, 2x^ + 1=4. 

Transposing, and dividing by the coefficient of x"^, we get x^ = ^. 
Hence, x = ± vT. Then, x' =+y/J, and x" = —Vj. The solu- 
tions may be left thus, or we may extract the indicated root approxi- 
matively. 

2. Solve the equation, 2x^ + 4 = 1. 

Reducing, we get x^=±^ — ^. Then, x' = -\- y/ — ^, and x" 

These roots are imaginary. How are we to interpret them ? An 
imaginary quantity indicates an impossible operation. Ought not the 
equation which produces it involve an impossibility ? In this instance, 
2x'^, an essentially positive quantity, is added to 4, and their sum is 
required to be less than 4. The condition of the problem is, then, 
absurd, or impossible, and the result is impossible, as it ought to be. 
It will be shown more rigorously, hereafter, that an imaginary solution 
always indicates absurdity in the conditions of the problem. The ima-/ 
ginary values, though they fail to satisfy the conditions of the problem, 
yet will satisfy the equation of the problem ; as they manifestly ought 
to do, since they have been truly derived from it. Substituting either 
+ v/ — ?>, or — v^ — -?, for x, in the equation, 2.x^ + 4 = l,we get — H 
+ 4 = i, or 1 = 1. ~ 

329. We observe, then, this remarkable analogy between imaginary 
values in equations of the second degree, and negative values in equa- 
tions of the first degree. The values, in both cases, will satisfy the 
equation of the problem, but will not satisfy the required conditions. 
There is, however, this difi"erence : to convert a negative solution into 
a positive one, numerically equal to it, we have only to impose a single 
condition; but, to convert an imaginary solution into a real solution, 
precisely equal to it numerically, we have generally to impose two 
conditions. Thus, the equation which gives the imaginary solutions, 
expressed in words would read thus : required to find a number, twice 
the square of which, augmented by 4, will give a sum equal to 1. 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 279 

The values are cc' = + ■«/ — 3, and a;" = — \/ — |. Now, to get 
real values numerically equal, and not to make any change upon the 
arithmetical values of the known quantities in the equation, it must 
be changed into 2aj^ — 4 = — 1. This equation, expressed in words, 
would read thus : required to find a number, twice the square of 
which, diminished by 4, will give a difference equal to — 1. The 
values of the new equation are cc' = + \/ -|- |, and x" = — V+l- 
These values are real, and differ from those in the first equation only 
in the signs of the quantities under the radicals. To get these new 
values, we made no change, arithmetically, upon the numbers in the 
first equation, but we made two changes of sign, or, in other words, we 
imposed two conditions upon the equation of the problem.

y/ — 2. To get the real values, x' = + >/ 2, and x" = — %/2, we 
must make h and a interchange values, b must be 4, and a, G ; that 
is, two conditions must be imposed.

The preceding examples are simple, and the solutions can be readily 
obtained. But there are many of a more complicated character, and 
of course more difficult to solve. No general rules can be given to aid 
the student 3 he must exercise his own ingenuity. It is well, however,

Clearing of fractions, we get ^/x^ + 144 + 12 = x^. 



Placing the radical by itself, we have y/x"^ + 144 = x^ — 12. 
And squaring both members, there results x^ + 144 ^= x'^ — 24x'^ +

330. There is another value which does not appear, it is xz=n. 
For, by the second principle, Article 321, the rational terms in the two

contained three values. We are sometimes enabled to detect a value, as 
in the above example, by equating the rational factors. When the root

PROPERTIES OF INCOMPLETE EQUATIONS. 

332. 1st. Every incomplete equation of the second degree has two 
values, and but two, and these values are equal with contrary signs. 

For, the general form of the equation is x^ =:zq or x^ — q = 0. The 
first member may be regarded as the difference of two squares, and can, 
therefore, be placed under the form of (x — \/ q) (x + n/ q}- Hence, 
the equation, x^ = q, may be written (x — %/§') (^c + \/q)^^- Now 
the product of two factors being equal to zero, the equation can be 
satisfied by placing either factor equal to zero. Therefore, x — y/q=^Q, 
and x -{• y/q = 0. From which, we get x = + y/q, and ar = — -Jq, 
or, distinguishing the values by dashes, a;' = + >/ q, x" z=^ — ^q. 
Since there are but two factors, the equation can be satisfied in but two 
ways. Hence there are but two values, and Ave sec that these are equal 
with contrary signs. 

By solving directly the equation, x^ = q, we would obtain the same 
results. But the process we have adopted is to be used hereafter for 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 285 

complete equations, and it is well to know that the properties of com- 
plete equations are also those of incomplete equations. 

2d. Every incomplete equation of the second degree can be decom- 
posed into two binomial factors of the first degree with respect to .r ; 
the first factor being the algebraic sum of x and the first value with its 
sign changed, and the second factor being the arithmetical sum of a- 
and the second value with its sign changed. 

The factors have already been obtained, and are (x — V q), an J 
(x + %/(/); and we see that these correspond to the enunciation of the 
second property. The product of these factors is zero. Hence, when 
wc know the two values of an incomplete equation, we can always form 
the incomplete equation itself which gave those values. We have only 
to change the signs of the values, and connect them with x. We will 
then have the binomial factors, and, placing their product equal to zero, 
we will have the equation required. Thus, form the equation that 
gives for x the two values, -f 2 and — 2. The two factors are (x — 2) 
and (x + 2), and the equation is (x — 2) (a; -f 2) = 0, or x^ — 4 = 0. 
The result can be verified by solving the equation, x'^ — 4 = 0. Or, 
since in the equation, (x — 2) (x + 2) = 0, we have the product of two 
factors equal to zero, the equation can be satisfied by placing either 
factor equal to zero. Hence, x — 2 = and .r + 2 =: 0. And these 
equations, when solved, give the values, + 2 and — 2.

BINOMIAL EQUATIONS. 

333. Any binomial equation of the n^^ degree can be solved as the 
preceding equations. We have only to extract the h*"" root of both 
members. 

Let a;^ = 27; then, x =\/W = 3. Let x"" = q; then, x == ^~q. 

If n be an even number, the radical must have the double sign, and 
two values, at least, of the equation will be known. If n be an odd 
number, only one value will be known. It will be demonstrated here- 
after, that every equation of the ?i*'' degree has n values. The method 
of finding the other values will then be explained. 



Let a;" = a^ ; then, x = ±yd^ = ±\/ ^/^(^ = ±n/± a. 

Then , x' = + ^ + a, x" = —^-\-a, x'" ^ + ^"-^a, xJ'" = —

is not often the case that they all can be found.

may be plainly represented by a single letter, — q, and tlie coefficient of 
the second may be represented by — p. Hence, the given equation as- 
sumes the form of x^ — px = — q; in which the highest term of the 
unknown quantity has a coefficient plus unity. Had the coefficient, 

— - of a;^ in the original equation been affected with the positive sign, it 

would have reduced to the form of x^ + 2^-^ — 5- ^^^ ^^^ coefficient 
of x^ been positive, and that of x negative, the equation would have 
assumed the form of x^ — px ^ q. Had the last conditions been ful- 
filled, and the prevailing sign in the second member at the same time 
negative, the equation would have assumed the form of x^ — px = — q. 
And, since every change that may be made upon the signs of the 
coefficients of x^ and x, and upon the signs of the known terms, will 
eventually lead us to one of the preceding forms, we conclude that 
every complete equation of the second degree may be placed under one 
of the following forms : 

x^ + px = q, First form, 
a;2 — jyx ^ -\-q, Second form, 
x^ + pjx = — q, Third form, 
x^ — px ^= — q, Fourth form. 

When a complete equation is given to be solved, it must first be placed 
under one of these forms. To do this, clear it of fractions, if it con- 
tain any, and then make the coefficient of the first term plus unity, if 
not already so, by dividing by this coefficient. The resulting equation 
will then be under one of the required forms. The form that the 
resulting equation assumes will, of course, depend upon the prevailing 
signs in the given equation.

Reduce the equation, — ^ 8 = ^ — ■ -4j to one of the four forms.

Hence, the equation has assumed the fourth form. 

Reduce the equation, — + o = — f to an equivalent equation, 

which will appear under one of the four forms. 

Multiplying both members by 20, the least common multiple of the 
denominators, we will get 5x^ — lOx -f 00 = — 24. Now, divide by

We see in this particular case, that we might have obtained the sam-e re- 
sult by multiplying the original equation by 4. This -would have made the 
coefficient of the first term unity, which is the main point to be attended 
to ; then, by transposition, the equation would have become x^ — 2x = 
— 16|. And we see tha-t the equivalent equation is of the fourth form. 
It frequently happens that it is impossible to make all the terms entire, 
and the coefficient of the first term at the same time plus unity. But, 
since this coefficient must always be plus unity, we derive the following 
rale for reducing any equation to one of the proposed form. 



RULE. 

Multiplij both members of the equation by the reciprocal of the co- 
efficient of the first term, and then transjxjse all the known terms to 
the second member. 

The multiplier in the equation, | o;^ — 2.r =: 4 is, + |. The multi- 
plier in the equation, — | cc^ — 2x = 4 is, — -^ . 

The reason of the rale is obvious, and needs no explanation.

Ans. x^ + '- = o. 

336. If the first member of the equation put under one of the four 
forms is a perfect square, the solution can be as readily effected as in 
the case of an incomplete equation. For, we will only have to extract 



292 EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 

tlic square root of botli mciubcrs, and then transfer the known term or 
terms in tlie first member to the second member, and then the solution 
will be complete. Suppose that the equation is a;^ + 2aa; + a^ =&. 
Extract the root of both members, then a; + a = =b ^b. Hence, 
x' = — a -\- -s/h, and a;" = — a — -Jh. We see that the equation 
has two values, and that these are not numerically equal, as in the case 
of incomplete equations. 

Now if, by any artifice, we can make the first member a complete 
.square, it is plain that there will be no difficulty in the solution of a 
compl-ete equation of the second degree. Let us then assume the equa- 
tion, x^ -\- "px = q, and examine what modification the equation must 
undergo, in order that its first member may be made a perfect square. 
The square of a binomial is composed of the square of the first term, 
plus the double product of the first by the second, plus the square of 
the second term. The square of a binomial is, therefore, a trinomial. 
.ir^ + jjx must then be made a trinomial by the addition of some quan- 
tity before the first member \Vill become a perfect square. What is the 
quantity to be added ? Take the expression, (x + a)^ = x^-\- 2ax -f- a'. 
We see that the third term of the trinomial is the square of the second 
term of the binomial in the first member ; and we sec that 2a,r, the 
second term of the trinomial, when divided by 2x, twice the first term 
of the binomial, gives a quotient, a, which is the second term of the 
binomial. This quotient, squared, is the third term of the trinomial. 
Now, suppose we only knew the first two terms of the trinomial, x^ and 
2ax, and wished to ascertain what was the binomial, which, when 
squared, would give these for the first two terms of its square. We 
would know that the first term of the binomial must be x ; and, since 2ax, 
the second term of the trinomial is twice this first term by the second 
terra, it is plain that the second term can be found by dividing by 2a,', twice 
the first term. Having found a, the second term of the binomial, we 
have only to square it, and the third term of the trinomial will be 
known. 

Apply these principles to the expression, a;^ -f px, regarded as the 
first two terms of a trinomial that is a complete square. It is plain 
that X is the first term of the binomial, the first two terms of whose 
square are x^ + ^«. The second term of the binomial can be found 

by dividing j^x by 2x, twice the first term : the quotient, ~, is the 
second term of the binomial, and its square, ^, is the required tliird 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 293 

term of the trimonial. If then ^ be added to x^ -\- V^, the first 

member will be a perfect square. But, if we add ^ to the first mem- 
ber, we must also add it to the second, eke the equality of the two 
members will be destroyed. Hence, the equation, x^ -\- px =^ q, can 

be changed into the equivalent equation, x- + px + x ~ 2 "^ jT" 
in which the first member is a perfect square. 
Now, extract the square root of both members, 

X + ^ = ± \/y + q. Hence, x' = — ^ + ^/^ + q, and 

Either of these values when substituted for x will satisfy the equation. 
The first, when substituted, will give ( — ^"'"V/'T'^!?^"^

satisfies the equation. The second, when substituted, gives 

/f p^ p' //>' 

Py t + 2 + T "^ '^ ~ 2 ~^'V J + 'i = !?> or !? = q. 

Hence, the second value also satisfies the equation. 

We have taken an equation under the first form, but it is obvious 
that the principles deduced are applicable to equations under either of 
the three other forms. Hence, for the solution of a complete equation 
of the second degree, we have this general 

RULE.

A common error with beginners is, to complete the square without 
observing whether the coefl&cient of the first term is plus unity. But 
it will be seen that the rule requires the first step to be the making of 
this coefiacient plus unity, if not already so.

Ans. x' = + 2, x" = + 14, 

2. Solve the equation, x^ — 4:X = — 4.

Ans. x' = — 2, x" = — 2. 

It is generally best to reduce the terms under the radical to a common 
denominator. 

Take the equation, — ax^ — cx= — m. This, when solved, gives 

X = — -— d=\/ 1- T— 0- The two terms under the radical can be 

2« V a 4a'' 

reduced to a common denominator by multiplying the numerator and 
denominator of the first by 4a, If m had been divisible by a, then a 
would not appear in the denominator of the first term, and the multi- 
plier then would have been 4a^. The single term, into which all the 
known quantities in the second member have been collected after the 
(Coefficient of x^ has been made plus unity, is called the ahsolute term. 

In the preceding equation, — is the absolute term. Then, to reduce the 

terms under the radical to the same denominator, we multiply numerator 
and denominator of the absolute term by either 4 tim.es the coefficient 
of the second power of x, or 4 times the square of this coefficient. 
This rule is only applicable when the reduced term in the second 
member was entire, previous to making the coefficient of x^ plus unity.

can be solved. But the solutions can be better understood when some 
of the properties of these equations arc known. 



First Projjcrf^. 

Every complete equation of the second degree has two values, and 
but two, for the unknown quantity. 

For, resume the equation, x^ + px = q. Complete the square of 

the first member, and we have x' -\- px + -^ = q + ^. Now, the 

4 4 

first member being a square, the second member may be represented by 

a square also. Hence, x'^ -}- j^x -{-—-= ni^, or (x + j^Y — "^^ = ^• 

Now, the first member being the diflerenee of two squares, may be re- 
solved by the principle of the sum and difi"erence into two factors. 
Then the equation, (x + pY — m^ = 0, will be changed into the equiva- 
lent equation, (x -i- p -{- m) (x -{- p — m) = 0. And since, when the 
product of two factors is equal to zero, the equation can be satisfied by 
placing either factor equal to zero, we have, x + p -\- m = 0, and 
x-\-p — m = 0. From which we get X = — p — m, iindx = — p + 7n ; 
or, distinguishing the values by dashes, x' = — p — m, and x" =z — 
p + m. Now, if we replaced m by its value, we would have the solu- 



-UC) EQUATIONS OF THE SECONIJ DEGREE. 

tions previously obtained. We sec that there are two values nume- 
rically unequal, and, since the equation, (x + p -\- m) (cc -f 7) — m) = 0, 
contains but two factors, it can be satisfied in two ways, and only in two 
ways. Hence, there are two, and only two, values for the unknown 
quantity. 

Sfcond Pmpcrty. 

338. The first member of every equation of the second degree can be 
decomposed into two factors of the first degree with respect to x^ the 
first factor being the algebraic sum of x and the first value of x with 
its sign changed ) and the second factor being the algebraic sum of x 
and the second value with its sign changed. The second member of 
the equation after this decomposition will be zero. 

The factors have already been obtained, and are (a^ + p -f 7)1) and 
[x, -\r p — ■?«)• By comparing these factors with x' and x" , we see 
that Ar p -\- in is equal to — x' , and that + p — «i is equal to — a;", 
and these factors then can be changed into the equivalent, {x — cp') 
and {x — a;") ; and the equation, {x ■\- p -\- m) (x. + j) — m) = 0, can 
be changed into (x ■ — x') {x — x") = 0. 

339. This important property enables us to find the equation whose 
values are known. We have only to change the sign of the first value, 
and prefix -f a? to it, and the first factor will be known; and then to 
change the sign of the second value, and prefix + x to it, and the 
second factor will be known. The product of these factors placed 
equal to zero is the equation required. 

Find the equation, whose values are -f 2 and — 3. The first factor 
must be (x — 2) ; the second factor must be a; + 3. Hence, (x — 2) 
(x+3) = 0, is the equation required. Expanding the first member, we 
have x^ -{- X — 6 = 0, or a;^ -f a; = 6. Completing the square, and 
solving, we get a- = — J db ^Q + I = — i rt v/-^' = — J d= | = 
-f I, or + 2, or — | = — 3. Hence, the process is verified. But 
the verification might have been made more readily, thus : the equation 
(x — 2) (.r 4- 3) = 0, can be satisfied by placing either factor equal to 
zero. Hence, x — 2 = 0, and a; + 3 = 0. These equations give the 
preceding values, + 2 and — 3. 

A few examples will make the beginner more familiar with the second 
property. 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 291 



EXAMPLES. 



1. Form the equation whose values are both — 2. 

Ans. (x + 2) Qc + 2) =r 0, or a-^ 4. 4.^ a. 4 = 0. 

2. Form the equation whose values are (f + ^h, and a — ^/i. 
Ans. (x — a — ^h) (x — a+ ^V) = 0, or x^ — 2«a- = h — a^. 



3. Form the equation whose values are — 2m + y/n + Ani^, and 
- 2w? — y/7i + 4ml Ans. x^ + Amx = n. 



4. Form the equation whose values are a — n+ s/m — 2an + n'^, 
and a — n — ^m — 2an + ?i^. 

Ans. x^ — 2 (a — «) ./; = m — a^. 
Verify these results by solving the equations. 

340. The second property of complete equations sometimes enables us 
to solve an equation very readily. For, whenever the factors of an equa- 
tion are apparent, we need not solve the eciuation itself, but only those 
factors separately placed equal to zero. Thus, take the equation 
01? + Ix = ax. By transposition we get, x^ ■\- hx — ax = 0. We 
see that a; is a common factor to the first member, and the equation 
may be written x (x-\- h — a) = 0. And since, when the product of 
two factors is equal to zero, the equation can be satisfied by placing 
either equal to zero, we have a; = 0, and x-\- h — a = 0. Hence, the 
two values are 0, and a — h. The general equation, x"^ -{■ hx — ax 
=z 0, slioios, furthermore, that when the unknown quantity enters into all 
the terms of the first member of an equation, ichose second member is 
zero, one value of the iinknown quantit}/ must nlwai/s be zero. 

Take, as a further illustration of the use of the second property, the 
equation, ax^ — bx^ -[-ax — bx = bx — ax. This equation can be 
written (a — b) x^ +2 (a — b) x = 0, ot x { (a — b) x + 2 (a —b) ) 
= 0, or X (a — b) (x + 2) = 0, or x(a — b) = 0, and x + 2 = 0. 
Hence, x' = 0, and x" = — 2. 

Again, x^ — ax -\- x — a = 0, may be written x (x — a) -f ■'" — ('' 
= 0, or (x — rt) (x -f- 1) = 0. Hence, x' = a, and x" = — 1. 

We have seen that the first two properties of complete equations are 
also properties of incomplete equations. The remaining properties are 
also, as we shall see, common to both classes of equations.

341. The algebraic sum of the values of every complete equation of 
the second degree is equal to the coefficient of the first power of the 
unknown quantity, with its sign changed. 

For the equation, si:^ + px = q, when solved, gave the two values, 



^' = -f + \/^ 



+ <1 



^' = -f-\/^+- 



Adding these equations, member by member, we get x' + x" — — p, 
as enunciated. 

The third property of complete equations is also a property of incom- 
plete equations. For, an incomplete equation of the form, x^ = q, may 
be written, x^ ~\-0x = q. The two values of this equation, solved 
either as a complete or as an incomplete equation, are, cc' = -f ^q^ and 
x" = — ^q. The sum of these values, x' + x", is plainly zero, 
which is the coefficient of the first power of x. An incomplete equa- 
tion then may be regarded as a complete equation, whose two values 
are numerically equal, but affected with contrary signs. 



Fourth Pfop)erty. 

342. The product of the values in every complete equation of the 
form, x^ + P^ = (J^ is equal to the second member or absolute term 
with its sign changed. 



For these values are cc' = — "o" + \/ T"^ S' 

andx" = —^ — S^/^+q. 

and their product, x'x" = -{- ^ U- -\- q\ =

This property belongs also to incomplete equations, for the two values 
of the equation, x^ = q, are x' = + y/q and x" = — .^q, and their 
product, x'x" =■ — q.

equations of every degi-ee, and that the first and second, with some 
modifications, are also properties of all equations.

2. What the product, and sum, in the equation, x^ + x = 1. 

Ans. x'x" = — 1, x' + x" = — 1. 

3. What the product, and sum, in the equation, x^ — px = — tj. 

Ans. x'x" = -\- q, x' + x" = + p. 



Fifth Property. 

343. The value of x, in every complete equation of the second 
degree, is half the coeflScient of the first power of x, plus or minus the 
square root of the square of half this coefficient increased by the 
absolute term. 

For the equation, x^ + px = tp when solved, gives x = — ^ ± 
\ / -J + q^ which agrees with the statement. 

It is obvious that this is also a property of incomplete equations, 
since, for such equations, ;? = 0. 

We have shown the foregoing properties by operating upon an equa- 
tion of the first form, but, since the demonstrations have in no way been 
dependent upon the signs of p and q, it is obvious that equations under 
the three other forms enjoy the same properties. 

The fifth property enables us to solve an equation directly, without 
completing the square in the first member j but it is well to require 
beginners to complete the square, until familiar with the principles.

times the product of the coefficient of x"^ into the absolute term, the 
values will be imaginary, if the sign of the absolute term is negative.

Now, we observe that the first and second forms diflfcr only in the 
sign of X, and that x' in the first form is the same as x" in the second, 
taken with a contrary sign ; x" in the firet form is the same as x' in 
the second, taken with a contrary sign. A similar remark may be made 
in regard to the values of the third and fourth fonus. We conclude, 
then, that to change the signs of the values, without altering them nu- 
merically, we have only to change the sign of the coofilacient of the first 
power of X. Thus, x^ + .x = 2, when solved, gives x' = 1, x" = — 2; 
and x^ — .X = 2, gives x' = 2, x" = — 1 . 

In like manner, x^ — 5x = 4, when solved, gives the two values, 
x' = + 4, .x" = + 2 ; and x^ + 5.r = — 4, when solved, gives

Hence, the first value is positive and the second negative, and the 
second is numerically greater than the first, because the radical is added 
to the quantity without the radical in the second value, and subtracted 
from it in the first value.

306 EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 

By extracting tlie square root of "^ + f? approximatively in the 

vaJucs of tlic second form, we would see that the first value was positive 
and the second negative, and that the second was numerically greater 
than the first. We have anticipated this, from what has been said 
before, as to the interchange of position and the change of sign between 
the values of the first and second form. 

In the third form both values are negative, because — ^ is ^

If 

/ -J — q. The second value is numerically greater than the first. 

In the fourth form both values are positive, and the first is numeri- 
cally greater than the second. These results might have been antici- 
pated from our knowledge of those in the third form. 

347. The discussion of the signs of the values in the four forms 
may be made otherwise, thus : we know, from the fourth property of 
equations of the second degree, that th.e product of the values in the 
first form must be equal to — q. Hence, the values must have con- 
trary signs. And we know, from the third property, that the sum must 
be equal to — p. Hence, the negative value is the greater. For, 
when we add a negative and positive quantity together, and their sum 
is negative, we know that the negative quantity is greater than the 
positive. 

For the second form, the product of the values is equal to — q. 
Hence, the values have difi'erent signs. Their product is equal to 4- p. 
Hence, the positive value is greater than the negative. 

For the third form, the product of the values is equal to -|- q. Hence, 
the values are both positive, or both negative. But their sum is equal 
to — p. Hence, they are both negative. "We cannot decide from this, 
however, which is the greater, the first or second value. 

For the fourth form, the product of the values is equal to -\- q. 
Hence, the values must have like signs, and must be both positive, or 
both negative. But their sum is positive, being equal to -j- p ; hence, 
they are both positive. We cannot decide from this, however, which is 
the greater, the first or the second value. 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 30' 



IRRATIONAL, IMAGINARY, AND EQUAL VALUES. 

348. The values, in all tlie forms, will be irrational whenever the 
root of the radical cannot be extracted exactly. In that case, the ap- 
proximate value of the radical can be determined to within a vulgar or 
decimal fraction, and then the approximate values of the unknown 
quantity will be known. 

There can be no imaginary values in the first two forms, because 
the quantities under the radical are affected with positive signs. "When- 
ever, then, the absolute term of an equation is positive, we know, cer- 
tainly, that there are no imaginary values in the equation. 

The third and fourth forms contain imaginary values, only when q is 

f? . 

^ ^. For, in that case only, is the prevailing sign under the radical 

negative. Whenever, then, an equation is put under the third or fourth 
form (the unknown quantity being freed from radicals, and the coeflS- 
cient of x^ being made plus unity), we can readily tell whether there are 
imaginary values. "We have only to square half the coefficient of the 
first power of x, and compare the result with the absolute term. 

The equations, x^ -|- lOx = — 30, and a? — lOx = — 30, both 
contain imaginary values, because (5)* <^ 30. Imaginary values, being 
always similar in form, are said to enter the equation in pairs. 

Since the two values of each of the four forms differ only by the 
radical, it is obvious that the disappearance of the radical will cause 
these values to become identical. But, the radical cannot be made to 
vanish in the first and second forms, because the quantities under the 
sign are positive. It will vanish, however, in the third and fourth 

forms, whenever ^=zq. The values of the third form will then both 

become — i^, and of the fourth form + ^. The equality of the 

values, in the third and fourth forms, differs from the equality of the 
values of incomplete equations. In the latter, it is equality only in a 
numerical sense; in the third and fourth forms, absolute equality. 

If we substitute ^ for q in the third and fourth forms, the equations 
will become x^ -}- px = — -^, and x^ — px = — ^, or, by transposi- 



tion 



, x^ + px + ^ = 0, and x^ — px + ^ = 



308 EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 

The first member of one equation is the square of (x + ^), and of 

the other (x — ^). Hence, when there are equal values in the third 

and fourth forms, the first members of those equations will be perfect 
squares, provided the second members are zero. 

The following are illustrations : x^ + Gx = — 9, and cc^ — 6x = 
— 9; x^ + Sx = —lQ,andx^ — Sx = — lQ. 



SUPPOSITIONS MADE UPON THE CONSTANTS. 

349. Known terms are frequently called constants, and unknown 
terms, variables. In the equation, x^ -\- px = q, p and q are the con- 
stants, and x the variable. 

Let us make the constant q — o, in the four forms. By going back 
to the solved equations, we see that the values will become 



^" _ p p 

2"" 2 ~ 


2h 


First form. 


^■ = f + f=., 




Second form 


^' = -f + f = o, 


P, 


Third form. 










Fourth form 



We see that the first and third forms have the same values, and that 
the second and fourth forms have the same values. This ought to be 
so, for the hypothesis, g- = 0, makes the first and third equations iden- 
tical, and also makes the second and fourth equations identical. 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 300 

We have gotten the foregoing series of values by making (j' = iu 
the solved equations. Ought we not to get the same results by opera- 
ting upon the given equations themselves ? When 3 = 0, the first 
and third forms become x^ -{- px = 0, ov x (x -{- p) :^ ; an equation 
which can be satisfied by placing either factor equal to zero. Hence, 
X = 0, and X + p = ; or, a;' = 0, and x" = — p ; the same as 
before obtained. The second and fourth forms become, when q = ^, 
x^ — 2)x = 0, or X (x — p) = 0. Hence, x" = 0, and x' =z + p, as 
before. 

When 2> = 0, we have this series of values : 

c' = -\-\/q, x" =z — v/gr, in the first and third forms. 

x' = 4-v/ — 'j> •^■" = — \/ — 'J, in the second and fourth forms. 

These results can be obtained directly from the equations ; for the 
first and second become x^ = q, and the third and fourth, x^ = — q. 
These two equations will plainly give the four preceding values. 

When p = 0, and q = 0, the system of values reduces to x' = + 0, 
x" = + 0, in each of the forms. This ought to be so ; for, in that 
case, the four equations reduce to the same, x^ = 0. 

The solutions of the four equations give formulas which can be ap- 
plied to particular examples. Thus, the values of the first form are 



Let it be 



-'=-f + \/f + q, and a^" = -J^-syj^ + 

required, now, to apply these results as formulas to find the values of 
the equation, x^ + x = 2. Then, jj = 1, and q = 2. Hence, x' z= 
— h + v/i- + 2= —^.^3^1. And x" = —i — ^i-^2 = — 
k — #= — 2. 

We have used as formulas the values x' and x", belonging to the 
first form, because the equation, x^ + x = 2,\s of that form. And, of 
course, we must always apply as formulas the values found in the form 
to which the given equation belongs. 



EXPLANATION OF LAIAGINARY VALUES. 

350. We have seen that the values of the third and fourth forms be- 

come imaginary when q was made greater than ^. It remains to ex- 

plain the cause of the imaginary results, and to ascertain what they mean. 

In the third form, the product of the values is equal to + q, and 

their sum equal to — p. The values, then, are both negative; and 



310 EQUATIONS or THE SECOND DEGREE. 

we liave previously seen that tliey were unequal wlicu ^ was unequal 
to q. If tlicy were equal, caeli must be — ^. Let x represent the 
execss of the greater over — ^. Then the value which is numerically 
the greater will be represented by — ( {y + x\, and the smaller nu- 
merically will be represented by — ("^ x\. Their product will 

be ^^ x^. Now, it is evident that this product will be the greatest 

possible, when x = 0. This condition makes the two values equal, and 
makes their greatest product ^ . But q represents their product, and 

it, therefore, can never be greater than -^. Hence, when we make 

4 

-7- ^ <?, we impose an impossible condition. An imaginary solution, 

then, indicates an impossible condition. 

Ought not the equation to point out an absurdity when an impossi- 
ble condition is imposed ? When the square is completed in the third 

form, the equation \s, x^ -\- px -\ ^ = — q, ox (x -\- ^\ ==j — q. 

p- 
Now, when q"^ ^, the second member is essentially negative, whilst 

the first, being a square, is essentially positive. We then have a nega- 
tive quantity equal to a positive quantity, which is absurd. A careful 
inspection, then, of the equation which j^roduces imaginarij values loill 
show an ahsurdity. 

We have examined only the third form, but the preceding conse- 
quences may be readily deduced by an examination of the fourth form. 

The following problem will illustrate more fully the subject of ima- 
ginary values. 

Required to divide the number 10 into two parts ; such, that their 
product will be equal to 30. 

Let X be one of the parts, then 10 — x will be the other, and, from 
the conditions we get x (10 — a;) = 30, or — x^ -\- l^x = 30. Mul- 
tiplying both members by minus unity, we get x^ — lOx = — 80, and, 
completing the square, x^ — 10a; -f 25 = — 5. Hence, x' = 5 -f 
^/— 5, and x" = 5 s/^^ 



GENERAL PROBLEMS. 311 

The values are imaginary, as they ought to be ; for the greatest pro- 
duct that we can form of two numbers, whose sum is 10, is 25. 
Hence, we have imposed an impossible condition, and the imaginary 
values point out this impossibility. The equation, x^ — lOx -|- 25 = 
— 5, may be written (x — 5)- = — 5 ; that is, a positive quantity 
equal to a negative one, which is absurd. The imaginary values will, 
however, satisfy the given equation, as they ought to do, since they 
have been derived from it. 



EXPLANATION OF NEGATIVE SOLUTIONS. 

351. Required to find a number whose square, augmented by three 
times the number, and also by 4, shall be equal to 2. 

The equation of the problem is a;'^ + 3x + 4 = 2. 

This equation, plainly, cannot be satisfied in an arithmetical sense ; 
for 4 is already greater than 2, and must be still greater when aug- 
mented by y^ and 3x. Solving the equation, we get x' ^ — 1, and 
:c"= — 2. 

These negative values satisfy the equation, but do not fulfil the con- 
ditions of the enunciation. For, x being negative, the equation will 
become x- — 3a; -t- 4 = 2. The true enunciation of the problem, then, 
is : Required to find a number, whose square, diminished by three times 
the number, and that remainder increased by 4 will give a result equal 
to 2. The equation of this problem, when solved, will give the two 
positive values, 1 and 2. 

Negative values then, in equations of the second as well as of the 
first degree, satisfy the equation of the problem, but do not fulfil the 
enunciated conditions ; and, since negative quantities indicate a change 
of direction or character, those negative values point out the change 
that must take place in the enunciation, in order that its conditions 
may be complied with.

9. Same problem as the last, except that the pedlar sold his clocks

10. A number of partners in business owe a debt of m dollars, but,

11. Same problem as last, except that the debt was 728 dollars, and 
that the increased portion of the solvent partners was 60 j dollars. 

Ans. x' = 4, x" z= — 3. 

The negative value is readily explained. An examination of the 
equation of the problem, after — x has taken the place of + x, wDl 
show that there have been two changes of condition, and the correspond- 
ing enunciation will be : " Several partners in trade owed a debt of 728 
dollars, and, by the accession of another partner to share the debt with 
them, their individual liability was diminished by GOf ; required the 
number of partners." These changes in the enunciation give -f- 3 for 
the number of partners, and the result can be verified. For, the share 
of each in the debt is, 242 f dollars before a new partner was added to 
the firm, and but 182 dollars afterwards. And, in general, for problems 
involving equations of the second degree, there must be two changes 
in the enunciation to convert a negative into a positive solution. 

12. The difference between the cube and the square of a number is

part, either |a — la ^5, or -S« + la \/b. 

Both values will satisfy the enunciation, in one sense ; for, a(%a —

tlie second value, §a« + Ws/^ = ^ -\- W^b + -j- = 2"' + iaVST 

The second value, however, does not satisfy the conditions of the 
problem, understood in a literal sense, for the greater part, 

— v/^j is less than the corresponding smaller part, %a + -^\/~^, and 

this corresponding part is greater than the whole quantity, a. The 
explanation of the negative solution is simple, when we return to the 
equation of the problem, x^ = a (a — x). When x is negative, this 
equation becomes, x^ = a(a -{• x), and the corresponding enunciation 
ought to be required to find a number, which shall be a mean between 
the whole quantity, a, and the sum of a and this number. 

The given quantity, a, might have been represented by a straight line, 

-f J-, and the problem then would have 

been to find a part, BC, which should be a mean between the whole, BA, 
and the part, AC, left after BC was taken from it. Now, when the ex- 
pression for BC became negative in the solution of the problem, it in- 
dicated that BC must be laid oif on the left of the point B, because 
this distance was laid off on the right of B, when its expression was 

positive. The diagram becomes -, 

and AC is greater than AB. This agrees with the second value of AC, 

3 a 

— a + 7^ v/^ which is greater than a or AB. The negative solu- 
tion here indicates then a change of direction, and the equation being 
of the second degree, there are two corresponding changes of condition. 
The first is expressed by the unknown distance being sought upon the 
prolongation of AB, instead of upon AB itself; the second is expressed 
by the unknown distance being a mean between AB, and A'B j'lus BC, 
instead of between AB and AB minus BC. 

The explanation of a negative solution need never be difiicult; we 
have only to change + x into — a; in the equation of the problem, and^ 
then examine and see what the resulting equation means. 

Some of the following problems will involve one of the four methods 
of elimination. Whenever the equations between which the elimina-

The number of killed and wounded was to the number of uninjured, 
including the prisoners, as 1 to 3. And the square of the number that 
escaped in safety from the expedition, was to the square of the number 
killed and wounded, as 6i to 1. Required the number of invaders,

TRINOMIAL EQUATIONS. 

353. A trinomial equation is one of the form, x^" + x" = q, involving 
but one unknown quantity and three terms, and having the unknown 
quantity in one term affected with an exponent double of that with 
which it is affected in the other. A trinomial equation then contains 
two terms, in which the unknown quantity enters, and an absolute 
term. 

Let it be required to solve the equation, x'^ + cc^ =: 20. 

Let x^ = y. Then the equation becomes y^ -\- y = 20. 

The last equation gives y = + 4 and y = — 5. But, x^ = y. 
Hence, x" = 4, o r — 5. Then, x' = + 2, x" = — 2, x'" = + V 5^ 
x"" = — ^/ — 5. Either of the four values will satisfy the given 
equation, a-'' -\- x^ = 20. The substitution of the last value gives 
(— x/— 5/ + (— ^^^bf = 20, or, 25 — 5 = 20, a true equation. 

Solve the equation, x^ — x^ = 702. Make x^ — y. Then the equa- 
tion becomes y"^ — ?/ = 702. From which, ?/=-{- 27, or, — 26. But 
x^ = y. Hence, x = 4/27 = 3, and x = ^ — 26. 

There are really four more values for x, since, as will be shown here- 
after, the number of values is exactly equal to the degree of the equa- 



EQUATIONS or THE SECOND DEGREE. 327 

tion. But the method of determining the other values belongs pro- 
perly to the general theory of equations. The two values found can 
be readily verified. 

The examples given are of a simple character. The equations were 
already of the proposed form. But it frequently happens that an arti- 
fice must be employed to put the equation under the form of x^" -|- a;" 
= q. Take, as an example, x^ -f ^x^ 4- 9 = 21. Add 9 to both 
membe rs, and w e have x^ -\-^ + ^x^ + 9 = 30. Make a:^ + 9 = /, 
then, v^a;^ -f 9 = y, and the equation becomes y^ ■\- y = 30. From 
which we get, ?/ -^ -f 5, or — 6. Then, a;^ + 9 = 25, or, j;^ -f 9 = 36. 
The values of x are -f 4, — 4, + v/27, and — v/27. The negative 
sign of the radical, ^az -(- 9, must be taken in connection with the last 
two values. This is indicated by the equation, y/x^ -f- 9 = y = — 6. 

Again, take ^^^^' + 1 = '^-^^ + 01- 
This may be written, ^:i±^' — (^!±J^' = 90. 

XX 

a-^4- 9 
Let =r ?/. The equation then becomes if — ?/ = 90. Hence, 

2/ = -f- 10, or — 9. Then, ^-^ =:. 10, and "^^ = — 9. These 

9 .9 

equations gives the four values, -f 9, -f 1, and — - -\- 2 ■</45, — ~ 

— i V'45: 



The equati on, i/x -f 1 -f X/x^ -1- 2x + 1 = 20, ,may be changed 
into ^x -\-l+ Vx -f- 1 = 20. Let Va; + 1 = y. Then ^/x + 1 
= 2/^ and the equation becomes %f -{■ y = 20. From which, ?/ = 4, or, 
— 5. Then ^/x + l = 16, and ^x -f 1 = 25. Hence, x = 255, 
or, x = 624. 

The equation, x^ -f ^x^ -f 56 = 34, may be placed under the pro- 
posed form by adding 56 to both members. Then, x^ -j-5Q-{-\/x^ -f- 56 
= 90. Let Vx^ + 56 = y. The equation then becomes y^ + y = 90. 
From which, y = -f 9, or, — 10. Then a; = -f 5, — 5^ 4. y 4T, 
--^/44^ 

These illustrations are sufiicient to explain the spirit of the process. 
No general rule can be given. Any modification may be made upon 
the equation that will place it under the proposed form.

PROBLEM OF THE LIGHTS. 

354. Two lights are placed on the same indefinite right line, the one 
shining with an intensity represented by a, the other with an intensity 
represented by b ; the problem is to find, on this indefinite line, the 
point or points of equal illumination — assuming a principle of optics, 
that the intensity of a light varies inversely with the square of the 
distance from that light. 

A IB 



Let A be the position of the first light ; B, that of the second. 

Let m = AB, the distance between the lights. 

Let a = intensity of first light, at one foot from A. 

Let b = intensity of second light at one foot from B. 

Let I be the unknown point of equal illumination. 

Let B I = ??(- — x = distance of same point from B. 

Now, in accordance with the assumed optical principle, the intensity 
of the first light, two feet from A, will be expressed by -7-\for 2^ : l'^ : : 
a : -r), at three feet, by -r-, and at x feet, by —^, and this last expres- 
sion will represent the intensity of the first light at the unknown point, 
I. In like manner, the intensity of the second light, at B, will be

denoted by r^. But, by the conditions of the problem, the in- 

(vM — xy '' ^ ^ 

tensities of the two lights must be equal at I. Hence, wc have —^ =

negative sign. Hence, -. = — ^, and r, = — — ^. And 

m — x ^i m — x" ^5 

1 • xi 1- , , m^/a , „ my/ a 

solving these equations, we get x: = _ — —^ and x'' = — =:--^^ — -^. 

Now, since there are two distinct values for rr, we conclude that in 
general there will be two points of equal illumination. By this we do 
not mean that there will be two points of equal brilliancy, but that there 
will be two points where the intensities of the two lights will be equal 
to each other. By subtracting cc' and x" in succession from m, we get 

, mh . ,, m^h 

^ -' - and — -" 



y/a + y/h ^a — y/h 

Hence, we have the system of values: 

x' = — ^= :=, distance from A to first point of equal illumination.

m — x = — = m, distance from B to same point. 

^/a+ ^h 

x" = —^ -=, distance from A to second point of equal illumina- 

m — x" = := -^_, distance from B to same point. 

Now, these expressions have been deduced upon the supposition that 
the point, I, was between A and B, and, consequently, we have assumed 
that the distance A I is positive, when estimated on the right of A, 
and the distance B I positive, when estimated on the left of B. Hence, 
if either x' or ic" becomes negative in consequence of any imposed 



EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 331 

condition, the corresponding point of equal illumination will be found 

on the left of A. And, in like manner, if either m — x' or m — x" 

becomes negative, the point will be found on the right of B. 

We will begin the discussion by supposing a = b. Then, x' =

examine whether there can be a second equally illuminated point, wheu 
the intensities of the two lights are the same. Wc have x" =

= cc, and m — x = jr— = — oo. ihcse values indicate that 

the second point is at an infinite distance on the right of B ; or, in 
other words, that there is no such point at all. This ought to be so, 
for, when the two lights are of equal intensity, the one cannot throw its 
beams with the same power to a greater distance than the other, and 
this must be the case if there be a second point. The second values 
(x" and m — x") then denote impossibility. By going back to the 
equation of the problem, wc see that it will become, when a = b, x^ = 

(jn — xy, an equation which can only be true when m = 0, or x = — . 

But wi = is contrary to the hypothesis ; hence, x = -— is the only 

true value. The assumption then, that there was a second point (a 
being equal to b), was absurd, and led to oo , the appropriate symbol of 
absurdity. 

"We will nest suppose a > i. 

Then, x' = —= n becomes "> — , because, if the denominator 

^/a + v/i 2 

m 

were 2 ^/a, the value of the fraction would be "i^, and since the deno-

minator is less than 2^ a, the value is greater than tt-

minator is greater than 2, ^h, the value is less than — . This result 

corresponds to the former, and places I nearer B than A ; that is, 
nearer the light of feebler intensity, as it ought to do. Wc see that x" 
is greater than m, for were the denominator of x", the -s/a, its value 
would be equal to m, but as y/ a — y/ b is less than V a, x" is greater 
than m. Hence, the second point of equal illumination is beyond B. 

T 1 . ,f m y/ b ^ . . , 

In this case, m — x = = =^ becomes negative, since the 

^a—^/b ^ 

numerator is negative and denominator positive, and, therefore, the 

second point must be on the right of B. The results then agree with 

each other, and agree with the fact. For, after passing the point I, the 

intensity of the 1st light becomes feebler than that of the 2d. At the 

point B, there is the greatest diflference between their intensities. 

Beyond B, both lights diminish in brilliancy, but the 2d more rapidly 

than the 1st, because of its greater feebleness; and we at length reach a 

point, V, where the illumination is equal. 

Next, suppose h^ a. 

Then, x! r= — ^;= ^ <r — . For, were the denominator 2 ^TT, the 

value of the fraction would be ~, but as the denominator is ^ 2 y/~a, 
the value of the fraction would be <^ —

Hence, the point, I, will be found nearer A than B. We have m — x' = 
^ ~2 ; for, were the denominator 2 ^Ij^the value would

be = - , but as the denominator is <^ 2 ^b, the value is ^ — . The 

Z 2 

results then agree, and place the point, I, nearer the feebler light. 

Again, we have x" = — = =. affected with the sign minus, the

EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 333 

numerator being positive, and denominator negative. The second point. 
I", must then be on the left of A. By multiplying the numerator and 
denominator, of the value of m — x", by minus unity, we will have ??i — 

x" = — =^ ^ m ; for, were the denominator z=z y/ b, the value 

■s/h — y/a 

would be equal to m, and since the denominator is <^\/b, the value is 
greater than m. Hence, the second point is beyond A at 1", as has 
just been shown. Were the values of m, a, and h, given, the position 
of the point of equal illumination could be readily determined. Let 
m = 20 feet, a = 16, 6 = 36. Then x' = ^ feet, and m — x' = 12 
feet, and the intensity of the two lights will be equal at the point cor- 
responding to these distances. For, the intensity of the 1st will be 

^, = \, and that of the 2d ^^ = \ 

I" A I B 



It can readily be shown that, between I and A, the intensity of the 
1st light is greater than that of the 2d. Thus, at 2 feet from A, that 
of the 1st light will be expressed by 4, and that of the 2d by -^. At 
the point I", 40 feet on the left of A, and 60 feet from B, the intensi- 
ties of both lights will be expressed by jjjjth, and arc, therefore, equal. 
And, by assuming other points, and calculating the corresponding 
intensities, we would find that they were only equal at I and I". 

Now, let m = 0, and a unequal to h, then x', m — x', x", and 

m — x" = 0. These are plainly absurd solutions, for the two lights, 

shining with unequal brilliancy, cannot, equally, illumine the point 

at which both are placed. By recurring to the equation of the problem, 

x^ a 
it becomes, when m =0, — , = — . This equation can only be true 

when a=zh, which is contrary to hypothesis. 
Now, let m = 0, and a = h. 

Then, x' = 0, m — x' = ; x" = —, and m — x" = — . The first 

two values (x' and m — a;',) show that the point at which the lights are 
placed, is equally illuminated. The second two (x" and m — x",) are 
the symbols of indetermination. This ought to be so, for when the 
equal lights are placed together, the points, at one foot, two feet, three 
feet, &c., are as much irradiated by one light as the other. There is, 



334 EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 

therefore, no particular determinate point at wliich the intensities are 
equal, and we say that the problem is indeterminate. By recurring to 

the ef|uatiou of the problem, = -—, we see that when m = 0, 

^ ^ (in — xy b 

and a=h,it reduces to an identical equal equation, x^ = x^, which can 

be satisfied for any values of x. 

Whenever we get tt as a solution to a problem, we can tell, by recur- 
ring to the original equation, whether it indicates indetermination. If 
the particular hypothesis, which reduces the solution to — , also reduces 

the original equation to an identical form, we have a case of indeter- 
mination. But, if the given equation do not reduce to an identity, we 
have a vanishing fraction. 

Another test, also, may be employed. If the value becomes -r- in con- 
sequence of a single hypothesis, we know, certainly, that we have a 
vanishing fraction, and not an indeterminate solution. The preceding 

values become -^ in consequence of the two hypotheses, m = 0, and 
a = h, and might or might not be vanishing fractions. Thus, the ex- 
pression, \ r^--rhi — To^, is a double vanishing fraction for a; = a, and 

^ {x — a) (x^ — Iry 

X =:h. 

Now, suppose the first light extinguished ; then, a = ; and we 
find x' and x" = 0, and m — x, and on — x" = m. These solutions, 
at first, seem absurd, since they indicate that the point of equal illumi- 



nation is at A. But, suppose the light at A to be very feeble, there 
will then be two points of equal illumination, I and F, very near to 
and on opposite sides of A. Make the first light still more feeble, and 
the two points, I and I', will approach nearer to A ; and, finally, when 
that light is extinguished, they will unite at A. 

Next, suppose both lights extinguished, or a = 0, and b = 0. 

Then, x', x", m — x', and m — x" become — -, indeterminate, as they 

ought to be. 

Suppose m = cc, or that the lights are infinitely distant from each

other. Then, if a and h are finite, the values all become infinite, as they 
ought, since there can be no point of equal illumination. The equa- 
tion of the problem, —. = , can be satisfied, when m == oc, 

^ x^ (m — xy 

by making x = 0, which places the point of equal illumination at A ; 
or, by making x = m, which places the point of equal illumination 
atB. 

Suppose, a := go; then, x' and x" both become equal to m, since 
v^6 may be neglected in the denominators of the fractions, and the 
point of equal illumination is then at B. The values of m — x' and 
m — x" become zero, and indicate the same point. This ought to be 
so ; for, by making the intensity of one light infinitely great, wc make 
that of the other relatively infinitely small, and we then ought to get 
the same result as we did when one of the lights was supposed to be 
extinguished.

355. The method of undetermined coefilcients is used to develop 
algebraic fractions into a series, and to determine the value of the con- 
stants which enter into identical equations j that is, equations which can 
be satisfied by any value whatever, attributed to the unknown quantity. 

For the development of fractions we assume the form of develop- 
ment ; and we are governed in our assumption of this form by our 
knowledge of what it ought to be. Thus, if wc proceed to expand 

— -— by the ordinary process of division, we obtain — ■ — = 1

arranged according to the ascending powers of x, and having x in each 
term affected with a positive and an entire exponent. The first terra may 
be supposed to contain x, affected with a zero exponent, and the coeffi- 
cients of x are then 1 1 -. -, -f &c. ; and it is evident that 

these coefficients are entirely independent of the particular values that 

may be attributed to x. They are still 1, f- — , s + &c.;

when X = 0, 1, 2, 1000, anything whatever. We may remark, in 
this connection, that the independence of the coefficients upon the 
vakie of the letter with which they are associated is not confined to the 
expansion of fractions, but is true in all developments whatever. Thus, 
(a + xy- = a^ -j- lax + oi? ; the coefficients arc a^, 2a, and 1, and 
these coefficients will not be altered by any change in the valu6 of x. 
We have seen, by perforhiing the division, that the exponents of x, 

in the development of '■ — , must be positive and entire, and that 

the coefficients must be independent of x. If, then, we were required 
to assume the form of development of this fraction, or any like it, we 
would know that the assumed form must fulfil the required conditions. 
Now, since a may be regarded as the coefficient of a", the fraction, 

, may be considered as arranged with reference to x. both in the 

a -\-x •' 

numerator and denominator; and we have seen that a fraction so ar- 
ranged, beginning with the zero power of x, gives positive and entire ex- 
ponents for X in the quotient. This law can readily be shown to be gene- 
ral, and it is not even necessary that the zero power of x should enter 
into the numerator. If the exponents of x in the numerator are all po- 
sitive and entire, and the terms arranged according to the ascending 
powers of x, and if the denominator is also arranged in like manner, and 
contains a constant^ a', that is, a term involving x°, then all the exponents 
will be necessarily positive and entire. For, take the general fraction, 

^-"^^ f . ^. = A -f 'Bx'^ -f Ca;-"" -{- &c., (N), in which the second 

member represents the development of the fraction. Now, since a frac- 
tion and its development must constitute an identical equation, it is 
plain that, from the nature of such equations, (N) must be true when 
£c = 0. But C.x"'', which represents the term (if any) containing a 

C 
negative exponent, can be written — , and is equal to infinity when 

X = Q. Hence, the whole second member is infinite. But, a; = ; 
reduce the first member to — ; n, on, p, and q being supposed posi- 
tive. Now, if a == 0, we have — ^ = = second member =r oo, which 

is absurd. If a be not zero, still we have — = oo, or a finite quantity 
equal to an infinite, which is absurd. 



UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS. 337 

If, then, all the exponents in the numerator and denominator are 
positive and entire, and the denominator contains a constant, or both 
numerator and denominator contain constants, all the exponents of the 
development must be positive. "We will now show that all the expo- 
nents of X must also be entire. We have represented, by Bx~, the 
term, if any, involving a fractional exponent. Now, suppose — =: ^. 

Then, Bx ° = Ba; = B^/j:. But every square root has two distinct 
values. Hence, ^y/x has two distinct values, and the whole second 
member has two distinct values. But no fraction containing only entire 
exponents can give two quotients. The assumption, then, of a frac- 
tional exponent in the development is absurd. If — = J, |, |, &c., the 

term Bx ■> would have three values and three quotients, which is ab- 
surd. So, if — = any fraction, there would be more than one quotient. 
m . 

We are now prepared to assume the form of development of any al- 
gebraic fraction, arranged according to the powers of a certain letter, 
and having that letter in the first term of the numerator affected with 
an exponent equal to, or greater than that of this letter in the first or 
last term of the denominator. The exponents of the aiTanged letter 
are also assumed to be positive and entire, both in the numerator and 
denominator. 

Let us then place — ; — = A -f- B.c + Gx^ + J)x^ + Ex* + &c., in 
a -j- X 

which A, B, C, D, &c., are independent of x, and in which all the ex- 
ponents of x are positive and entire. A is the representative of that 
term which does not contain x, or contains x affected with a zero expo- 
nent. There is generally such a term in a development, and there 
must, of course, be a representative of that term. Clearing of frac- 
tions and arranging according to the ascending powers of x, we have 

a = Aa + a B I i- -f rt C I x2 -f « D I x^ -f a E I x*-{-&c. (31). 
+A I -f B I +C\ +cl 

Now, since the coefficients are supposed to be independent of x, their 
values will not be affected by making x — 0. If then we can deter- 
mine these values when x = 0, they will be true when x = 1, 2, 3 ; 
anything whatever. Making x = 0, we have a = Aa. Hence, A = 1.

Now,, since a = Ka, tlaese two terms cancel each other, and (M) becomes

And, since we have found A« — a =zO, a A 4- A = 0, aC + B = 0, 
aD+ C = 0, &c., we conclude, that, if ice have an equation wliose first 
member is zero, and xohose second member contains all its terms ar- 
ranged according to the ascending powers of a certain letter, the expo- 
nents of this letter being all positive and entire, and its coefficients in- 
dependent of it, these coefficients will be sep)arately equal to zero. 

This is the first enunciation of the principle of undetermined co- 
efficients, and ought to be remembered. 

The second enunciation, (which is an immediate consequence of the 
first), is as follows : if we have an equation of the form, a-\-hx+ cx^ -|- 
dx^ + ex* + &c., =a' -\- b'x + c'x^ + ^'^^ + '^^'^ + &c., which is satis- 
fied for any value of x, then the coefficients of the like powers of x 
in the two members will be respectively equal to each other. 

For, by transposition, we have r= (a' — a) x° -\- (Jj — b) x -\- 
(c' — c) x^ ■\- (d' — d') x^ -f (e' — c) x* -\- &c. And, since these coeffi- 
cients are independent of x, we must have, by what has just been shown, 
a' — a = 0, b' — b = 0, d — c=0, d' — d = 0, ^ — e = 0, &e. 
Hence, a' =^ a, b^=b, cf = c, d = d, e' =^ e, as enunciated. 

The preceding equation, a + ix -f cx^ -f dx' -f ex* -f &c. = a' -f 
b'x -f c'x^ -\- &c., and all other equations to which the second enuncia- 
tion is appliablc, belong to a class of equations called identical equa- 
tions, the two members of which diffi^r only in form. 

It is, in general, most convenient to develop expressions in accord- 
ance with the second enunciation.

have A = 1, and we might proceed as we did with the fraction, .

But, by the second enunciation, we have at once A = 1,B + A = — 1, 

C + B = 0, C + D = 0, and E -f D r= 0. From which, A := 1, 

Br= — 2, C = +2, D= — 2, E=— 2. And, substituting these

This is tlic same result that we would obtain by actually performing 
the indicated division. 

We have assumed the form of development to be A + Bx + Cx^ + &c., 
in which the exponents are all positive and entire. Now, if we have 
an expression whose development must necessarily contain negative or 
fractional exponents, it would be absurd to place it equal to A + B + a; + 
C.T^ + &c., and the result will make manifest the absurdity by the 

symbol, cc . Suppose it be required to develop -. It is plain 

that the first term of the development is x"' ; if, then, we attempt to 
develop the expression by the method of undetermined coefficients, we 
commit an absurdity, and that absurdity ought to be made manifest in 
the result by the appropriate symbol, co . 

Let, then, — —, = A + Bx + Cx^ + J)x^ + Ex" + &c. 
X — x/ 

From this we get l=Ax + (B—A)x^-{-(G — B)x^-].(D — C)x*+&c. 

Now, in accordance with the first enunciation, make x = 0, and we 
get 1=0, an absurd result. But, if we first divide both members by 
X, and then make x = 0, we will have i = go = A, and the absurdity 
is pointed out by its appropriate symbol. 

The above expression can be developed by changing its form. De- 
compose 5 into its factors, — X j; , then develop bv 

X — a; X 1 — X ^ 1 — X

FAILING CASES. 

356. Any fraction, all of whose exponents are positive and entire iu 
the letter according to which the series is to be arranged, can be de- 
veloped, provided the denominator contains a constant. Again, any 
fraction, all of whose exponents arc positive and entire in the letter 
according to which the series is to be aiTanged, can be developed ; pro- 
vided, that there is one terra, at least, in the denominator, the expo- 
nent of whose arranged letter is equal to or less than the exponent of 
the same letter in, at least, one term of the numerator. A fraction 
that fulfils either of the foregoing conditions can always be developed, 
and the development will be the same as the quotient. The reason of 
this is plain ', the method of undetermined coefiicients gives a develop- 
ment for fractions, which is the same that would be obtained by actual 
division, beginning with the lowest power of the arranged letter. Now, 
a fraction that fulfils either of the foregoing conditions, will, when ex- 
panded by division, necessarily give positive and entire exponents in 
the arranged letter, when the division has been begun, with the nume- 
rator and denominator arranged according to the lowest power of this 
letter. 

Division would give us two quotients for zr, according as we

342 UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS. 

mined coefficients gives but one development, whicli is the same as 
that obtained by arranging the numerator and denominator with refe- 
rence to the lowest power of x. Therefore, the formula, which is ap- 
plicable only to positive and entire exponents, must fail, when the least 
exponent of x in the numerator is less than the least exponent of x in 

.x^ 4- c^ 
the denominator. Thus, '—^ cannot be developed, because o^, which 

involves the lowest power of x in the numerator, gives a quotient 
affected with a negative exponent when divided by x, the correspond- 
ing term of the denominator.

357. It will be observed that, in most of the preceding examples, any 
term of the series after a certain number from the left, can be formed 
from the term immediately preceding, or from two or more preceding 
terms, according to some fixed law. Thus, in Example 2, every alter- 
nate term of the series is formed from that which precedes it, by multi- 
plying by — .T. The series in 5 and 6 are formed in the same way, the 
multipliers, or all the terms, being x~'^ and x\. In 7, every term after 
the second is formed from that which precedes it, by multiplying by 2x. 
In 8, we may regard the constant multiplier as — cc, and omit every 
alternate set of two terms. In 9, the multiplier may be regarded as 
— x, and, when three terms occur togethei*, these are omitted. In 11 
and 16, the multiplier is — x. In 12, the multiplier, for all terms after 
the second, is — \x. In 13, the multiplier is x~'^y. In 17, the con- 
stant multiplier, after the second term, is — x. In 18, the multiplier, 
after the fourth term, is — x. In 19, there is no law of formation. 

When the terms of a development are formed from those which pre- 
cede according to some fixed law, the development is called a recurring 
series. Multiplication is not the only mode of forming the succeeding 
terms; sometimes they are formed by addition or subtraction, and even 

by a combination of two of these methods. Thus, ; ^ —^

expressions that may be developed by first making them rational in 
terms of a new variable, expanding the new expression, and replacing 
the new variable by its value iu terms of the old. So, there are an 
infinite number of expressions, involving negative exponents, that may

There are many expressions, however, involving negative and frac- 
tional exponents, that cannot be developed by the method of undeter- 
mined coefficients. 



DERIVATION. 

361. When one quantity depends upon another for its value, it is 
said to be a function of the quantity upon which it depends. The 
dependent quantity is the function, and that upon which it depends is 
called the variable. Thus, in the equation, y = 2x, y is the function 
and X the variable, because, by changing the value of x, y may be made 
to have any system of values. Thus, when a; = 0, *, 1, 2, 3, &c j 
y=0, 1,2,4, 0, &c., it is evident that, in every single equation involving 
two unknown quantities, there is a function and variable. Either of the 
unknown quantities may be assumed at pleasure as the function, because 
both unknown quantities are mutually dependent upon each other. But 
it is usual to regard that unknown quantity as the function, with refer- 
ence to which the equation has been solved. If the equation, y = 2a", 

is solved with respect to a;, we have a; = -^. Then, x is the function 

a 

and y the variable, and, by assuming arbitrary values for y, x may be 
made to have an infinite system of values. The most general form of a 
solved equation of the first degree with two unknown quantities is, y = 
ax -f b. In this, a and b are called constants, because their values 
undergo no change. It is plain that y depends for its value upon x, a, 
and b, but, as its value only changes with x (since x is the only variable), 
7j is called a function of x only. If we have a single equation involving 
three unknown quantities, any one of these unknown quantities is a 
function of the other two. 

If we have y = ox, ov y = ax + b, and x — viz, or x = viz -f v. 



348 DERIVATION. 

we call y an explicit fuuetion of x, and an implicit function of z, 
because y directly depends upon x for its value, and indirectly upon z. 
It is plain that we may have explicit functions of any number of 
variables, and, also, implicit functions of any number of variables. We 
will, however, confine ourselves to explicit functions of single variables. 

If we take the equation, y = ax + h, and attribute to x arbitrary 
values, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., and call the corresponding values of y, y, y', 
y", y"', &c., we will have y = h, y' = a + h, y" =2a -\- b, y" = 3a 
+ h. Then, y' — y = a, y" — ?/' = «, y'" — y" = a, &c. That is, 
the difierence between any two consecutive states of the function is 
constant. This constant increase of the state of the function is called 
the differential or derivative of the function. It is evident that, when 
the function and variable are both linear, that is, both of the first 
degree, the difference between two consecutive states of the function 
will always be constant, and then will be truly the derivative of the 
function. Thus, take the equation, y =: 2x -\- 2, and let x have the 
constant increment J, beginning at ; that is, let a; = 0, + i, J + ^, 
1 + i^j I2 + J; then the difference between two consecutive values of 
y will always be constant. For, we have y = 2, y' =zl + 2 = 3, 
y" = 2 + 2 = 4, y'" = 3 + 2 = 5, &e., and, consequently, y' — y = 
l=y"—y'= y'" — y", &c. 

But, when the variable is of the second degree, and the function of 
the first, the difference between two consecutive states of the function, 
corresponding to constant increments of the variable, will not be con- 
stant. Thus, take the equation, y = x^, and let x have the constant 
increment, 1, beginning at zero. Then, y = 0, y' =zl, y" = 4, y'" = 9, 
&c., and y' — ^=1? y" — y' =^^j 1/'" — y = 5. The student of 
geometry will understand that there ought to be no constant increment 
to the function, corresponding to a constant increment to the variable in 
the equation, y =^ 0?. For, y expresses the surface of a square of which 
X is the side, and the surface of course increases more rapidly than the 
side. If the function is of the first degree, and the variable of the 
third, it will be seen that the difference between two consecutive states 
of the fuuetion varies still more widely from a constant. The function 
and variable must then both be of the first degree, in order that the 
difference between two consecutive states of the function may be con- 
stant. But, to return to the illustration of the square, it is plain that, 
if the constant increment to the side of the square was indefinitely 
small, the difference between two consecutive states of the function, 
which represents the increment of the fuuetion, would be so nearly con- 



DERIVATION. 349 

stant that it might be regarded as constant. Suppose y = a:^ and that 
x=^\ foot. Then the surface of the square is one square foot. Now, 
suppose the side of the square to receive the constant increment, 

1 2 1

y" = ^^ 10000 + (TOOOO/' *^''- ^^^°' •^' "^ "^ 10000 + (10000?'

?/" — 7/ = 1 -„. And we see that the diflPerence between 

■^ ^ 10000 ^ (10000)'' 

the second and first states differs only from the difference between the 
third and second, by jq^oo- 

Upon this principle the derivative or increment of a function is 
found. It is the difference between two consecutive states of the 
function, when these states are indefinitely near to each other, and it 
expresses the increment of the function. The word increment is used 
in its algebraic sense. When any state of the function is less than the 
preceding, the derivative is truly a decrement. 

To find the derivative of the function, y = a-^, let h represent the 
infinitely small constant increment to x. Then, y = x^, y'= (x + h)^ 
= x"^ + 2x7* + h^, and y' — y =^ 2xh -f h^. Now, since h is infinitely 
small by hypothesis, h^ will be an infinitely small quantity of the second 

order, and may therefore be neglected. Thus, -z — rrp— is very small, 
' •' ° '1 million •' 

but -rz, 777^ — r% is much smaller. Now, by making h indefinitely small, 

(1 million/ 7 .; o J ? 

we have taken the states indefinitely near to each other, and, conse- 
quently, y' — y is the derivative of y = x?. Hence, the derivative of 
0^ is 2x7t. It is usual to represent h the increment of the function by 
dx, read differential of x. The derivative of the square of any variable 
function is then twice the first power of the variable into the differential 
of the variable. The differential coefficient of a function is the 
differential of the function divided by the increment of the variable, 

and is generally expressed by '^— — '- . In the preceding example the 

differential coefficient of x^ is 2.r ; and, in general, knowing the 
differential of the function, we get the dift'erential coefficient by dividing 
by the increment or differential of the variable ; and, conversely, we get 
the differential of the function from the differential coefficient, by mul- 
tiplying by the differential of the variable. It will be seen that, when 
30

wc make h = 0, or indefinitely small, that the differential coefficient 
assumes the form of ^, for then i/' = y. 

To find the differential coefficient, we have the following 



RULE. 

Give to the variahle a varialle increment, h, and find the neiv state 
of the function. Take the difference between the new and old states of 
the function, and reject the terms involving the higher powers of the in- 
crement, as heing infinitely small quantities of the second, third, &c., 
orders. Next change h into dx, dy, or dz, &c., according as the va- 
riahle is X, J, or z, &c. We then have the differential of the function. 
Divide the differential of the function hy the differential of the va- 
riahle, and we have the differential coefficient.

Newton regarded all algebraic expressions as the representatives of 
lines, surfaces, or solids; and supposed lines, whether straight or curved, 
to be generated by the flowing of points according to fixed laws, surfaces 
to be generated by the flowing of lines, and solids to be generated by 
the flowing of surfaces. Thus, a point, moving or flowing according to 
the law that it shall always be in the same plane, and at the same dis- 
tance from a point, will generate the circumference of a circle; and a 
straight line, flowing with the two conditions of being constantly parallel 
to, and at the same distance from a fixed line, will generate the surface 
of a cylinder. A straight line flowing in the same direction with the 
condition that, in all its positions it shall continue parallel to itself in 
its first position, will generate a plane. One line revolving around 
another, to which it is perpendicular, _L, will generate the surface of a 
circle. A flowing square will generate a cube; a flowing semicircle, a 
sphere. Newton regarded the increment of the function as expressing 
the uniform rate of increase of the function, and called it fiuxion. 
The thing generated he c^W^di fluent. It is evident that the fluxion 
does not express the uniform rate of increase, except when the states 
are taken indefinitely near to each other. Suppose a cannon-ball to 
leave the mouth of a piece with a velocity of 2000 feet per second, and 
that this velocity is reduced to 1200 feet per second at the end of the

third second. It is plain, that the diiFerence between the spaces passed 
over in any two consecutive instants of time will not be equal to the 
difference between the distances passed over in any other two consecu- 
tive instants, unless those instants are inappreciably small. But, for 
the millionth part of a second, the velocity might be regarded as con- 
stant. If the instant was then taken thus small, the difference between 
the spaces in two consecutive instants would be constant. 

The differential of the function has, in accordance with the New- 
tonian theory, been defined to be the uniform rate of increase or 
decrease of the function. The differential of a constant then, must be 
zero, since a constant admits of neither increase or decrease. 



Theorem I. 

362. The differential of the algebraic sum of any number of func- 
tions of the same variable is equal to the algebraic sum of their diffe- 
rentials. 

Let ?/=-±iudczvzt:w±z; «, v, lo, and z, being functions of the 
same variable, x. Give to the variable a variable increment, h, and 
call the new states of the function «', v', xo', and z. Then y = «' =h 
v' zh w' ± z', and y' — 1/ = u' — m =fc (v' — v) ± (ic' — ic) ± (/-^ z) 
as enunciated, since u' — « is the differential of m, v' — v, the diffe- 
rential of V. A shorter notation is dy = du rt dv rfc: dw ± dz, and is 
read differential of y, equal to the differential of ?<, plus or minus the 
differential of r, &c. 

Let y = ax^ + ex. Then, dy = 2axdx -f- cdx. 

Theorem II.

equal to the product of the constant by the differential of the variable. 

Let y = Ax. Then, dy = Adx. For, y' = A (x -{- h), and 
y' — y = Ah, or dy = Adx. 

Let u = my. Then, du = mdy.

Hence, we have --- =■ ??«""', and, consequently, dy = na^~hlx. The

known. 

Theorem IV. 

365. The differential of the product of two functions of the same 
variable is equal to the sum of the products which arise from multiply- 
ing each function by the differential of the other function. 

Let y =1 uv. Then dy = udv •-(- vdu, in which u and v arc both 
functions of the same variable, x; the new state of the function is 
n' = u + du, and the new state of the function v' = v + dv. Hence, 
y' = u'v' = (u -\- du) (v + dv) ^uv -{• udv + vdu + diidv. But, 
since du and dv are indefinitely small, their product, dudv, is an in- 
definitely small quantity of the second order, and may therefore be 
neglected. Hence, y' = uv + udv + vdu, and y' — y, or dy = udv 
+ vdu, as enunciated. 

Corollary. 

366. 1st. The differential of the product of any number of functions of 
the same variable is equal to the sum of the products which arise from 
multiplying the differential of each function by the product of the other 
functions. 

Let y = swuz, in which s, w, %i, and z are functions of the same 
variable, z. Then, dy = icuzds + suzdw -f swzdu -f sicudz. 

To show this, we will first get the differential of the product of three 
variables. Let y = szv. Make sz = u. Then y = uv, and, from what 
has just been shown, dy = udv + vdu = szdv -f vd (sz) = szdv -f- 
V (sdz -\- zds) = szdv -f vsdz -\- vzds, as enunciated.

Now, knowing the differential of the product of three variable func- 
tions, we can readily pass to that of four. For, let y = swuz. Then, 
Ji/ z= svmJz + zd (^Rwu) = sicuch -f z (sic(7v -f sudw + icuds) = swudz 
+ zswdu -\- zsudw + zicuds. And, it is plain that the same process can 
be extended to the product of any number of functions. 

2d. Since the differential of the product of Av is Adv -f vdA =

another way. 

Theorem V. 

367. The differential of a fraction is the denominator into the diffe-

This ought to be so, for, when the numerator is constant and the 
denominator variable, any increment to the variable, x, upon which v 
depends, will decrease 1/ ; and, consequently, cTy, which expresses the 
algebraic increment of 7/, is truly a decrement, and ought, therefore, to 
have the negative sign. In the case supposed, y is a decreasing function 
of the variable, x, and we see that the differential of a decreasing 
function is negative. 

We are now prepared to find the differential of any function affected 
with any exponent, whether positive or negative, fractional or entire. 



Theorem VI.

the product arising from multiplying the exponent of the power into 
the quantity affected with an exponent algebraically less by unity than

This is evident, since we may represent the quantity within the

BINOMIAL FORMULA. 

373. By actual muhiplicatiou we can readily find 

(a + xf = a'' 4- 2ax + o:% 

(a + xf = a^ + Sa\v + Sax'' + x% 

(a + xy = a* + 4a''a; + QaV + Ao'x^ + x\ 

We observe a simple law in" regard to the exponents in these three 
developments. The exponent of a in the first term is the power of 
the binomial, and this exponent goes on decreasing by unity unto the 
last term, in which it is zero. For, x^, x^, and x* may be written, a^x^, 
a".*', and a°x*. The exponent of x is zero in the first term, and goes 
on increasing to the last term, in which it is equal to the power of the 
binomial. With regard to the coefficients, we observe that the coeffi- 
cients of the extreme terms are unity, that the coefficient of the second 
term is the degree of the binomial, and that the coefficient of the third 
term can be found by multiplying the coefficient of the second term by 
the exponent of a in that term, and dividing by the number of terras 
which precede the required term. Thus, in the development of 
(a + xy, to find this coefficient, multiply 4, the coefficient of the second 
term, by 3, the exponent of o in that term, and divide by 2, the number 
of terms which precede the required term, the quotient 6 is the co- 
efficient of the third term. So, to find the coefficient of the fourth term 
of (a + xy, multiply G, the coefficient of the third term, by 2, the ex- 
ponent of a in that term, and divide the product, 12, by 3, the number 



BINOMIAL FORMULA. 357 

of terms whicli precede the required term, the quotient, 4, is the co- 
efficient of the fourth term. This remarkable law in regard to the co- 
efficients, holds true even for the second and last terms. 

We observe, furthermore, that the sum of the exponents of a and x 
in every term is equal to the exponents of the binomial and that the 
coefficients, at equal distances from the extremes, are equal. 

Newton showed that the law in regard to the exponents and 
coefficients was general for any binomial of the form (a + x)"", and 

that we would have (a + x)'" = a" + ma'"-^x -i ^^ ^-^ \-

DEMONSTRATION. 

374. To demonstrate this useful and remarkable Theorem, let us 

assume (a -f x)"'=A -f A'x -f A'V + A''^ + A'"x"' ; in which 

m is taken positive and entire, and A', A", &c., independent of x. 
Then, by the principle of undetermined coefficients, we have a right to 
make a; = in both members of the assumed identical equation. 
Making a: ^ 0, we have A = a". 

It was shown that, when two functions of the same variable were ecjual, 
that their diffiDreutials were equal. Hence, taking the derivations of 
both members of the assumed equation, we have ?»(a + j)'"~hlx = 
(zV + 2A"a; -f 3A'V -f &c.)'/^, or, dividing by (Jx, m(a + j-)"-' = 
A' -f 2A"a; -f ^A"'x^ + &c. (N). Now, make x = 0, and we get, 
ma"""' = A'. Again, taking the derivatives of both members of (N), 
and dividing by dx, we get, m (m — 1) (a + a-)""^ = 2A" + 

2.3. A"'x + &c. (P). Making x = 0,we have A"= "^ ("^ — 1) """' ^ 

Again, taking the derivation of (P), dividing by dx, and making a: ^ 0, 

there results A = — ^ o o. • -In hke manner, we can 

find A"" = ^»0»'— 1)C» ' — -) ('« — 3) ^"-^ 



2.3.4 
And A" will plainly be equal to 

m (m — 1) (m — 2) .... (m — (m — 1) ) a"-" _ 
1.2.3.... {m — 2) (m — 1) m ' 

and, since the factors of the denominator are the same as those of the 
numerator, only written in reverse order, we have A" = 1. 



358 BINOMIAL FORxMULA. 

Now, replace A, A', A", &c., by tlielr values iu the assumed 
identical equation, and we have (a + x)- = d'" + ma'"-^ x +

The term,

1 . 2 . 3 . . , (ri _ 1) ' 

is called the n*"", or general term. An inspection of the formula will 
show that the first factor of the numerator of the coefficient of a iu 
any term is m, the next factor (m — 1), and so, on decreasing by unity, 
unto the last factor, which is m, diminished by two less than the place 
of the term. Thus, the last factor of the numerator of the coefiicient 
of the 4tli term is (m — 2). So, the last factor of the numerator of 
the coefficient of the n^^ term must be (m — n + 2). The denominator 
of the coefficient of a, in any term, is always the continued product of 
the natural numbers, from 1 up to one less than the place of the term. 
Hence, the denominator of this coefficient in the n^^ term must be 
1 . 2 . 3 . . . . (n — 1). In regard to the exponents, we see that a, in any 
term, is always affected with the exponent of the binomial, diminished 
by the number of the term less one, and the exponent of x, in any 
term, is always one less than the place of the term. Hence, for the ?i*'' 
term, we have «"'-''+' a;"~'. 

The binomial formula is usually written iu the ascending powers of «, 
instead of x. To develop (x + «)" in the powers of a, it will be 
necessary to regard a as the variable, and x as the constant, to make 
a = in the successive steps of the operation. As we would obviously 
obtain the same result, with the exception of an interchange of x and a, 
we may at once write 

, VI (m — 1) .t'"~^ a^

We will repeat the laws in regard to the exponents and coefficients. 
1. The first letter of the binomial appears as the first term of the 



BINOMIAL FORMULA. 359 

development, affected with an exponent equal to tliat of the binomial, 
and the exponents of this letter in the successive terms decrease by 
unity unto the last term, where its exponent is zero. The exponent of 
the second letter of the binomial is zero in the first teroLi of the develop- 
ment, and one greater in each of the successive terms, and, in the last 
terra is m, the exponent of the binomial. 

2. The sum of the exponents of x and a, in every term of the 
development, is equal to the exponent of the binomial. A simple in- 
spection of the formula will show this. 

3. The coefficient of the first term of the development is unity; that 
of the second term is equal to the exponent of the binomial; that of the 
third term is formed by multiplying the exponent of the first letter of 
the second term by the coefficient of that letter, and dividing by one 
less than the number denoting the place of this required term ; that of 
the Ji*'' term is formed from the (/i — l)"* term, by multiplying together 
the coefficient and exponent of the first letter of that term, and divi- 
ding this product by {n — 1), that is, by one less than the number of 
the required term. 

4. There will always be «z + 1 terms in the development. For, we 
get one term, a™, or of, without differentiating, and, since the exponent 
of m is diminished by unity for each differentiation, it is plain that m 
derivatives can be taken of (a + a:)", and, since we get a term of the 
development by each derivation, we must have in all (m -f 1) terms. 

5. The coefficients at equal distances from the extremes are equal. 
For the developments of (a -\- xj" and (x + a)" must be identical, 
differing only in the order of the terms; the first term of the develop- 
ment of (a -j- a:)" being the last term of that of (x -\- «)"", the second 
from the left of the development of (a + x)" being the second from 
the right of that of {r, -f a)" , &c. Hence, the terms of the develop- 
ment of (a -f a;)", taken in reverse order, will constitute the direct 
development of (x -f- «)"• I*^ is plain, then, that the second term from 
the left must have the same coefficient as the second term from the 
right, the one being formed from a" in the same manner as the other 
from a™, and so, in like manner, all the other coefficients at equal dis- 
tances from the extremes must be equal. 

6. The sum of the coefficients of the development of {x -f a)*" is 
equal to the m^^ power of 2. For, if we make a- = 1 and o := 1 in 

the equation, (x + a)™ = x"" -\- ^/i.r"""' a -\ ^^ z — -^ + 



360 BINOMIAL FORMULA.

to the sura of tlic coefficients, and the first member will become 2"", and we 

will have (1 + i)" = 2- = 1 + m + m (m - 1) + ^^'^On—l)(^m—2) 

+ &c. We make x and a unity, in order to reduce the terms in the 
second member to their coefficients; and, it is plain, that if x and a had 
another value than unity, the second member would not be the sum 
of the coefficients. 

In accordance with the demonstration, the sum of the coefficients in 
the development (x + of, ought to be 4 ; for, in this case, m = 2, and 
(2)"" = (2)^ = 4. And, in the development of (x + a)^, m = 3, and 
(2)"" = (2)^ = 8, which agrees with the fact. So, likewise, in the 
development of (x -\- ay, m = 4, and (2)" = (2)'' = 16, which also 
agrees with the fact. 



FORMATION OF POWERS BY THE RULE. 

375. Let it be required to find the development of (x -\- of by the 
rule. The first term is x^, the second term has 5 for a coefficient, and 
the exponent of x is one less in this term than in the preceding ; a 
also enters to the zero power in the first term ; and, since the expo- 
nents of a go on increasing by unity, a must enter to the first power in 
the second term. Hence, the second term is 5x'*a. The coefficient of 
x in the third term is formed by multiplying 5, the coefficient of x in 
the second term, by 4, its exponent, and dividing the product by 2, 

5x4 
the number of terms preceding the required term. Hence, —^ — =10, 

is the coefficient of the third term, and, from the law of the exponents, 
X must enter to the third power, and a to the second power in the 
third term. Hence, that term is lOx^a^ For the coefficient of x in 

10 3 

the fourth term, we have — ^ — = 10, and the fourth term must be 

10 . 2 
lOx'^a". For the coefficient of the fifth term we have — - — — 5, and 

that term itself must be 5xa''. For the coefficient of the sixth term 

5 (1) 
we have — = — = 1, and that term itself must be x^a\ or a'. For the 

5 

coefficient of the seventh term we have — ^ = 0. 'Hence, there is no 



BINOMIAL FORMULA. 3G1 

seventl> term. Then, the development of {x + a)* is x^ + ox*a + 
lOx'a^ + lOx^a^ + 5xa* + o', and we see that the sum of the coeffi- 
cients is equal to (2)^ = 32, and that the sum of the exponents of x and 
a in each term is 5. 

The preceding development might have been obtained directly from 

, ^ , , . , m(m — l).c'"~V ,, 
the general formula, (^x+ a) = a;" -f mx^ 'a -\ — h &c., 

by making m = 5. But the above process is generally shorter when 
m is positive and entire. 



DEVELOPiMENT OF [x — a)'". 

376. The development of (x — a)" may be obtained in the same 
way as that of (x + a)". But it may be gotten at once from the gene- 
ral formula by changing + a into — a ; the terms involving the odd 
powers of a will all be negative, and we will have (j: — a)° = af — 

mx'"-ki + ^ ^ . ^^ ^ ^ ^' g + ± a". 

The last term will be positive when m is an even number, and nega- 
tive when m is an odd number. 

It will be seen that all the laws in regard to the development of 
(x 4- a)" hold good in regard to the development of (x — a)", except 
that the alternate terms must be affected with the negative sign, and 
that the sum of the coefficients is zero. 

A few examples will illustrate the use of the two formulas for the 
development of (.x -f «)■" and (x — a)".

Ans. x^ — ^x^a + 36xV — 84xV + 126xV — 126a'V + 84xV 
— 36a;V + 9xa« + a». 

377. The binomial formula has been deduced upon the hypothesis 
that the coefficients and exponents of x and a were unity, but it can 
be applied to binomials in which these conditions are not fulfilled, by 
substituting for the letters within the parenthesis other letters whose 
coefficients and exponents are unity. Thus, to get the fifth power of 
z^ + Zy", let z^ = X, and 3y/^ = a ; then, {z^- + ^iff = (« + aj = x' 
-\-bx'^a + lOcc'a^ + lOx^a? + bxa'^ + a^, which, by substituting for x and 
a their values, will be found equal z^° + Ibz^f -\- OO^y + 270^y + 
^{)bzhf -f 243^'°. 

In like manner, we may find the development of (nx^ -\- ra^)'" = 

m (m — 1) r2«"'-=£cP'"--''a2^ 
jr.rP" + 7?ir?i'"-'.r'""-P«i + — ^i ^-—^ 1- ■ • ■ r'"a'^"\ (A) 

In this general formula, make x = 1, and a = 1 • the second mem- 
ber will reduce to the sum of the coefficients of x, and the first member 
will become (n -f i-)"". Hence, the sum of the coefficients of any bino- 
mial develojnnent is equal to the m** power of the sum of the coefficients 
within the 2}cirenthesis. 

In accordance with this general formula, the sum of the coefficients 
of the development of (2^ + oy^y ought to be equal to (4)^ = 1024; 
and this agrees with the development above, for 1 + 15 + 90 + 270 
+ 405 + 243 = 1024. 

378. Formula (A) shows, moreover, that if the exponents of x and 
a are equal, that is, p — q, the sum of the exponents of x and a in 
each term of the development will p?n. Whenever, then, the exponents 
ofs. and a arc equal in any binomial, the sum of the exp)onents of these 
letters in each term of the development will be equal to the common ex- 
ponent xoithin the 'parenthesis into the exponent of the poxoer to xohich 
the binomial is to be raised. 



BINOMIAL FORMULA. 863 

The two important laws just deduced from formula (A) are general 
for all binomials. The second and sixth laws, observed to govern the 
development of (x + a)", are but particular cases of the foregoing. 

The binomial formula can be extended to polynomials, by representing 
the polynomial by the algebraic sum of two letters. Thus, to obtain 
the square of cc' + 4:X^ — 8x — 8, represent x'^ -f 4:X? by x, and — Sx 
— 8, by a. Then, (x» + Ax"" — Sx — Sf = (x + of = x" + 2,ax 
4- a^ = (by replacing x and a by their values), x® -f 8x* — 80x' + 
l'28.c + 64. In like manner, to obtain the cube of x^ -\- 2x — 4, 
let x" = X, and 2x — 4 = a; then, (x' + 2x — 4)' = (x + af= x" 
4- 3x^a + 3a^x + a', which, by replacing x and a by their values, 
becomes x« + 6x^ — 40x' + 96x — 64.

rigorously by assuming (x + a)""" = A + A'a + A"a^ + A."'a^, &.C., 
and proceeding just as we did when m was positive and entire, regard- 
ing a as the variable. But it is not necessary to repeat the operation. 
We have a right to assume the exponents of a to be positive and entire 
in all the terms of the development; because, if we expand any frac- 
tion whose numerator is a constant, and the first term of whose deno- 
minator is a constant, all the exponents of the variable will be positive

DEVELOPMENT OF BINOMIALS AFFECTED WITH NEGATIVE

380. When m, the exponent of the parenthesis, (x -\- dy°, is posi- 
tive and entire, it is evident that successive differentiation will even- 
tually reduce that exponent to zero, and then the next differential will 
be zero. And, since the constants, A, A', &c., of the assumed develop- 
ment, have been determined by the successive differentiation of 
(x + ay, it is plain that the development will terminate. But, when 
the exponent of the parenthesis is negative or fractional, successive 
differentiation can never reduce it to zero, and, therefore, an infinite 
number of constants can be determined in the equation, (j: -\- a)~'", or,

CONSEQUENCES OF THE BINOMIAL FORMULA — SQUARE OF 
ANY POLYNOMIAL. 

381. We have seen that (a-{-by=a'' + 2ab + b% that is, the 
square of a binomial, is equal to the sum of the squares of its two terms, 
plus the double product of those terms. To find the square of a tri- 
nomial ; a + b -\- c, let a + b = s. Then, (a + i + c)^ = (s + c)* = 
s2 + 2sc + c'^^a + by +2c(a + b) + (? = ct" + i^ + c^ + 2ca -(- 
2cb + 2ab; that is, the square of a trinomial is equal to the sum of the 
squares of its three terms, plus the double product of these terms taken 
two and two. To find the square of a polynomial of four terms, a -{-b 
+ c + (7, let a + t + c = s' Then, (ii ^ b -\- c ■\- df = (s' + dj 
= s'2 + 2.i'il+ rp = a' + b' + c"" + (P + 2r/a + 2db + 2dc + 2ca + 
2cb -\- 2(ib ; that is, equal to the sum of the squares of all its terms, plus 
the double product of these terms taken two and two. Now, it is evi- 
dent that the same law will hold good for the square of a polynomial 
composed of five terms. For this square is composed of the square of 
the first four terms plus the square of the fifth term, plus the double 
product of the fifth term by the sum of the first four terms. And, 
since the square of the first four terms will give the sum of the squares 
of all these terms, plus the double product of these terms, taken two 
and two, it is evident that, when the double product of the fifth term 
by the sum of the other four, is added to the other double products, 
we will have the double product of all the terms, taken two and two ; 
and it is plain, moreover, that when the square of the fifth term is 
added to the sum of the squares of the other four terms, that we will 
have the sum of the squares of all the terms. The law is then true for 
five terms, and it is plain that the same reasoning can be extended to 
sis, seven, and any number of terms. Hence, we conclude, that the 
square of any polynomial is equal to the sum of the squares of all the 
terms, plus the double product of all the terms, taken two and tico.

BINOMIAL FORMULA. bOU 

EXTRACTION OF THE Xth ROOT OF WHOLE NUMBERS AND 
POLYNOMIALS. 

383. The most important consequence of the binomial formula is, 
that we are enabled by it to extract high roots of whole numbers and 
polynomials. We will begin with the simplest case, the extraction of 
the «" root of whole numbers. 



EXTRACTION OF THE Xih ROOT OF WHOLE NUMBERS. 

Let a represent the tens, and b the units of the required root. Then, 
the given number will be (a + />)", and from the binomial formula wo 
have 

(a + iy = a- + na--^b+ ^ ^ ^ + ^ tV^S^ + '-^'''- 

That is, a number, whose n^^ root is composed of tens and units, is 
made up of the ??<■' power of the tens, plus n times the (it — 1)"" power 
of the tens into the first power of the units, plus, &c. 

It is evident that the Jt" power of the tens will give, at least, ?* + 1 
figures, therefore, the »*■» root of the tens cannot be sought in the 7i 
right hand figures. These must, therefore, be cut off from the right. 
We next seek the greatest n^^ root contained in the left hand period, 
and, when we have found it, we will have a of the formula. Raise the 
root found to the Ji*' power, and subtract this power from the left hand 

period. The remainder will correspond to na^~^h + — -^— ^~^ + 

kc, of the formula. The appi-oximate divisor to find h (the unit of 

xi x^ • n I mi X T • • „ 1 " (" — V)n'^^h 
the root) is na""'. The true divisor is ;ia°~' + -^= — = — -^ + 

n (n _ 1) (n — 2)«"-^i= , , , , , • , ' ^' , 
1~9 — 5 1 ^^ ' "'^^> ^^ '■' ^^ unknown, we can only use 

the approximate divisor. The n — 1 figures, on the right of the remainder, 
must be separated from the other figures, because n times the (n — 1)"" 
power of the tens will give, at least, n figures. Dividing the period on 
the left by the approximate divisor, we get the units of the root, or, gene- 
rally, a number greater than the units, because our divisor is too small. 
It is plain that the number of ternis rejected when using the approximate 
divisor, depends upon the number of units in n, and that the value of 
each term depends mainly upon a. When, therefore, n and a are both 
large, or when one only is large, the approxiinate divisor is very consider- 
ably too small, and the quotient, therefore, will be too great. Raise the 

Y 



370 N BINOMIAL FORMULA. 

two figures of the root found to the «*'■ power, and compare the result 
with the given number; if it be greater than this number, the last figure 
of the root must be reduced by one, or more. Let us illustrate by an 
example. 

Required the fifth root of 33554432. 

885 54432 I 32 
243 I 

«a»-' = 5 X 81 = 405 92 "54432 

We began by cutting off the five right hand figures. The next step 
was to find 3, the greatest fifth root contained in 335, the left hand 
period. Next, the approximate divisor, 405, was formed, and this was 
found to enter twice in the left hand period of the remainder, after 
subtracting the n^^ power of the tens from the given number. Upon 
trial, 32 is found to be the true root, for, (32)* = 33554432. In this 
case, the unit figure of the root not being large in comparison with the 
tens, the approximate did not differ so materially from the true as to 
give a quotient figure too great by unity, or some other number. But, 
suppose it were required to extract the fourth root of 230625. 

Then, 39*0625 1 25 

16 



jia"-' =4 X {2f = 32, 230 625 

The approximate divisor gives 7 as a quotient ; but, upon trial, it 
has (o be diminished by 2; and 25, not 27, is the true root. 

It will be seen that the units of the root can only be ascertained by 
trial. If the units of the root be large in comparison with the tens, 
the quotient obtained by dividing the left hand period of the remainder 
by the approximate divisor, will often differ considerably from the true 
units of the root. The following example will illustrate this : 



</ 



13 0321 = 19 

1 



««"-• r=: 4 . 1' = 4 120'321 = mf-'b + " ^" \^"" '^'' + &c. 

In this example, the approximate divisor gives 80 as a quotient, but 
this is absurd. We try 9, the greatest figure of the units, and find it 
to be right; for (19)' = 130321. The quotient, 30, being so large, we 
concluded that the units of the root must be large, and, therefore, 
tried 9. 



BINOMIAL FORMULA. ^^Tl 

Our reasoning has been confined to numbers whose root contained 
but two figures ; but, as in the corresponding cases of the extraction 
of the square root and cube root of whole numbers, it can readily be 
extended to numbers whose root contains any number of figures. It is 
not necessary to repeat the generalization of the principles, and we, 
therefore, pass at once to the rule for the extraction of the n"" root of 
whole numbers. 

RULE. 

I. Divide the given number into periods of n figures each, begin- 
ning on the right. Extract the n"" root of the greatest n"* jMwer con- 
tained in the left hand period, and set this root op, the right, after the 
manner of a quotient in division. Subtract the n'^ poicer of the root 
so found from the left hand period. 

II. To this remainder annex the next period, and separate from the 
new number so formed the n — 1 figures on the right. Regard the left 
hand period as a dividend. 

III. Divide the dividend by n times the (n — J^ power of the first 
figure of the root. The quotient will be the second figure of the root, 
or a number greater than the true second figure of the root. Raise the 
two figures of the root found to the n"'^j02oe?-. If the residt exceed the 
two left hand periods of the given member, the last figure of the root 
must be reduced %intil the v^'^ power of the two figures is equal to, or 
something less than the ttco left hand periods. 

IV. Annex the third period to the remainder^ after subtracting the 
vl^ power of the first two figures of the root from the two left hand 
periods, and cut off n — 1 figures from the right of the new number 
thus formed, and regard the left hand period as a new dividend. 

V. Divide this dividend by n times the (a — 1)"" poioer of the first 
tioo figures of the root, the quotient will be the third figure of the root, 
or a number greater than the third figure. Ascertain, by trial, whether 
the last figure is correct, and proceed in this way until all the periods 
are brought down. The number of figures in the root will ahcays be 
equal to the number of periods in the given number.

PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 

388. Permutations are the results obtained by writing n letters lu 
sets of 1, 2, 3, ... . or n letters, so that each set shall difter from all 
the other sets in the order in which the letters are taken. Thus, the 
permutations of the three letters, a, h, and c, taken singly, are a, h, c ; 
and in sets of two letters each, ah, ac, ha, he, ca, cb ; and in sets of 
three letters each, abc, ach, hac, hca, cha, cab. 



PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 875 

It will be seen that the sets differ only in the manner in which the 
letters are written, the letters in all the sets being the same. 

389. Let it he required to determine the number of permutations of 
m letters, taken n in a set. 

Suppose the letters to be a, h, c, d, &c., and let us first permute them 
singly, we will evidently have m permutations of the m letters taken 
one in a set. Now, let us reserve a, there will remain m — 1, letters 
b, c, d, &c., which, permuted singly, will give (m — 1) permutations, b, 
r, d, e, f, &c. : write a before each of these letters, and we will have 
in — 1 permutations, ah, ac, ad, &c., of two letters, with a as the first 
letter of each set. Next, let us resei-ve b out of the letters, a, b, c, d, 
&e., and then permute a, c, d, &c., singly. We will again have (m — 1) 
permutations of the letters, taken in sets of one letter each. Writing b 
before each of these sets, we will have (m — 1) permutations of n». 
letters, taken in sets of two, with b as the first letter. Reserving c in 
like manner, we can again form (m — 1) permutations of m letters, 
taken two in a set, with c as the first letter of each set. Reserving all 
the m letters in succession, we can evidently form m (jm — 1) permu- 
tations of m letters, taken 2 in a set. And, of these, a will be the first 
letter of (m — 1) sets, b the first letter of (nt — 1) sets, c the first 
letter of (in — 1) sets, and so on. It is plain, moreover, that a will 
not only be the first letter of (»i — 1) sets, but that it will also be the 
last letter of (m — 1) sets, and that it therefore has been made to 
occupy all possible positions. As the same remark may be made of b 
and all the other letters, it is obvious that m (ni — 1) truly expresses 
the number of permutations that can be made of m letters, taken two 
in a set. That is, the number of permutations of m letters, taken two 
in a set, is equal to the total number of letters into the total number of 
letters, less one. 

In like manner, we may find the number of permutations of m letters, 
taken three in a set. For, if we omit one of the letters, as a, there 
will be m — 1 letters left, and these, permuted in sets of two letters, 
will give(w — 1) (m — 2) permutations. For, we have just seen that 
the number of permutations, taken in sets of two, was expressed by the 
number of letters into the number of letters, less one. Writing the 
reserved letter, a, before each of these (in — 1) (m — 2) sets, we will 
form (m — 1) (in — 2) permutations of m letters, taken three in a set, 
with a as the first letter of each set. Reservino; in succession each of 



370 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 

the tn letters, wc can plainly form m {in — 1) (in — 2) permutations 
of m letters, taken three in a set. 

By the same course of reasoning it can be readily shown that the 
number of peirmutations of m letters, taken four in a set, will be ex- 
pressed by m (m — 1) {in — 2) (m — 3) ; and of m letters, taken five 
in a set, by m (m — 1) {m — 2) (w — 3) (m — 4). 

We observe, in all these expressions, that the first factor is the number 
of letters, and that the last factor is the number of letters, diminished 
by the number in a set less one. Moreover, each factor after the first 
is one less than the preceding factor. Hence, the number of permu- 
tations of m letters, taken n together, will be expressed by m (in — 1) 
{m — 2) (m — 3) (in — n + 1), or, denoting by A the num- 
ber of permutations of m letters, taken n in a set, wc have A = 
in (in — 1) (in — 2) (m — n + 1). 

To apply this formula, it is best to determine in the first place the 
last factor, we then know where to stop. Since the first factor is 
always the number of letters, and the law respecting the mean factors 
is known, the formula can then be readily applied. 



1. Required the number of permutations of 10 letters, taken 7 and 7. 
Ans. 10 (10 — 1) (10 — 2) (10 — 3) (10 — 4) (10 — 5) (10 — 6), 

Orl0x9x8x7x6x5x4 = 604800. 

For, 11 = 7, and in = 10, then in — n -j- 1 = 10 — 7 + 1 = 10 — 
6, the last factor is then 4, and the first 10, the intermediate factors can 
easily be formed.

(•12 — 7X(12 — 8) (12 — 9) (12 — 10) (12 — 11) ; or, reversing the 
factors, 1x2x3x4 x5x6x7x8x9x 10 X 11 X 12. 



PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATION; 



Remarks. 

390. If, in the general formula, A = m(m — 1) (m — 2) . . . . 
(m — n -\- 1), we make m = n, and call B the corresponding value of 
A, we will have B = n (?i — 1) (n — 2) .... 4 x 3 x 2 X 1 ; or, 

reversing the order of the factors, B = lx2x3x4 {n — 2) 

(n — V)n. Hence, the number of permutations of n letters, taken all 
together, is equal to the product of all the natural numbers from 1 to 
n, inclusive. 

Example 5 is an illustration of this. 

It is plain that, by increasing n (jti remaining constant), we will in- 
crease the number of permutations, because we will have more factors 
in the product that expresses the number of permutations. And, when 
n is made equal to m, this product is the greatest possible. Thus, the 
result is greater in example 4 than in 3, and greater in 5 than in 4. 

When n = m + 1, the whole formula reduces to zero. This plainly 
ought to be so, since it is impossible to permute m letters in sets of 
m+ 1 letters. Zero, here, Ss in many other places, is the symbol of 
impossibility. • 

When n = 1, the last factor, m — n + 1, is equal to m. Hence, 

the first and last factors are the same, and we have A = ^- = m ; that 

is, the number of permutations of m letters, taken one in a set, is equal 
to m. 

COMBINATIONS. 

391. Combinations are the results obtained by writing any number 
of letters, as m, in sets of 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3, .... w and n, 
m and m, so that each set shall differ from all the other sets by at least 
one letter. In permutations, the sets differ in the order in which the 
letters are written ; in combinations, the sets differ in the letters them- 
selves. Thus, the letters, abc, taken all together, give but one combi- 
nation, abc; but will give six permutations, 

abc, acb, bar, bca, cab, cba. 

If the same letters are taken two and two, they will give but three 
combinations 

ab, ac, be, 

while each combination is susceptible of two permutations ; and there

392. Let it he o-equircd to determine the total immhcr of comhtna- 
nations of m letters, tahen n in a set. 

It is evideut, from what has been shown, that if we knew the total 
number of combinations of m letters, taken n in a set, that we could 
get the number of permutations of m letters taken n in a set, by mul- 
tiplying the number of combinations by the number of permutations 
obtained by permuting each combination ; or, in other words, by multi- 
plying the number of combinations of m letters, taken n in a set, by the 
number of permutations of n letters, taken all together. Conversely, 
when the number of permutations of m letters, taken n in a set, and 
the number of permutations of n letters, taken all together, are known, 
we can, by dividing the former by the latter, determine the number of 
combinations of m letters, taken n in a set. 

393. To illustrate more fully by an example. 

Let us* combine the four letters, a, h, c and d, in sets of three, we 
will have the four combinations, 

ahcy ahd, acd, hcd. 

If, now, we permute each of these sots, taking all the letters in each 
set, we will have the total number of permutations of four letters, taken 
three in a set, that is, the total number of permutations of vi letters, 
taken n in a set. 

"Writing the results in tabular form, we have

We see that each of the four combinations, in sets of 3, gives six 
permutations, taken 3 and 3. There will, therefore, be 4 X 6 = 24 
permutations of four letters, taken three in a set. Now, as a corres- 
ponding table could be formed for any number of letters, it is plain that 



PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 379 

the total number of permutations of m letters, taken n in a set, is equal 
to the number of combinations of m letters, taken n in a set, multi- 
plied by the number of permutations of n letters, taken all together. 

Hence, if 

X = the number of combinations of m letters, taken n in a set ; 
Y = the number of permutations of n letters, taken all together ; 
Z = the total number of permutations of m letters, taken n in a set, 

we shall have Z = X . Y. Hence, X ^ y. 

But Z and Y are already known. 

For Z = m (m — 1) (m — 2) {m — ?i + 1), Formula (A) ; 

and Yr= 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 n, Formula (B). Hence, we have X==

number of permutations of n letters, taken « in a set. 

In the application of this formula, it will be of service to remember 
that the first factor of the numerator is the number of letters, that each 
successive factor is one less than the preceding, and that the last factor 
is the number of letters diminished by the number in a set, less one. 
It is well, then, to determine first the extreme factors of the numerator; 
the mean factors can then be readily supplied. 

In regard to the denominator, the last factor is the number in a set, 
and the factors counted to the left go on diminishing by unit}'^ unto 
the first factor, which is always unity.

For m = 6 and n = 4. Hence, the first factor of the numerator is 
6, and the last m — n ■{■ 1 = 6 — 4 + 1 = 6 — 3. The two mean 
factors of the numerator are then readily formed, the extremes being

394. The last ten examples show that the same number of letters, 
combined differently, may produce the same number of combinations, 
that is, the number of combinations of m letters, taken p in a set, may 
be equal to the number of combinations of ??i letters, taken g' in a set. 
We propose to show that this will always be so when m =p -^q. Thus, 



PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 381 

in example 10, vi = 50 and p = 47 ; in example 11, m = 50 and 
q = o. The results have been the same in those examples, because 
m = p + q. 

To show this, suppose p^ q. Then the number of combinations 
of m letters, taken p m sl set, will be expressed thus : 
^ _ m{m — 1) .... (ot — g4l) (??i — q) (m — q — 1) (711— p + 1 ) 

1 . 2Ts (p-iy^ ■ 

And for the number of combinations of m letters, taken g' in a set, 
we will have the formula, 

_ «i (m. — I) (m — 2) (m — 9 + 1) 

^ - 1.2.3 (q-l)q — 

Hence, D = C (^- 9) (^ -9- 1) ■ • • • (^ -^ + 1 ) 

(? + 1) (? + 2) p 

Now, it is plain that D will be equal to C, when (m — q) (m — q — 1) 
&c. =p(p — 1) . . . . (q + 2) (5' + 1). Or, since tlie foctors iu 
both members go on decreasing by unity, and since the number of 
them is also equal, the last equation will be true when m — q =:p, or 
in = q -\- p>, fis enunciated. 

This rule is of importance whenever _?J ^ -^^ • 

For, then, we have only to take the difference between /) and m, and 
the number of combinations of m letters, taken m — p and m — p, will 
be the same as the number of combinations of m letters, taken p and p. 
Thus, in example 10, instead of taking the number of combinations of 
50 letters, taken 47 in a set, we may take the number of combinations 
of 50 letters, taken 50 — 47, or 3 in a set. 

In like manner, the number of combinations of 100 letters, taken 90 
in a set, would be the same as the number of combinations of 100 
letters, taken 10 in a set. 

395. If, in the formula, D = C (^-g) («^-g-l) • • • -(^^-p + D 

(9 + 1) (9 + 2) . . . . p ' 

we make q = v — 1, we will have D = C : for, in that 

case, J) will have only one more factor than C. Hence, the number of 
covibinations of m letters, taken p and p, is equal to the number of 
combinations of m letters, taJcen p — 1 and p — 1, multiplied by the 

factor When p = 2, 3, 4, &c., or the sets are made up 

of 2, 3, 4, &c., letters, the factor ~ will become —^ — ,

— ^T — , — J — . Suppose, for example, that we have 8 letters, or 

m =z 8, then the successive multipliers will be |, |, |, |, |, '^. And, 
since the number of combinations of 8 letters, taken 1 and 1, is 8, we 
will have the number of combinations, taken 2 and 2, 3 and 3, 4 and 4, 
&c., expressed 8 X | = 28, 28 x | = 56, 56 X | = 70, 70 x | =56, 
56 X i = 28, 28 x' f = 8. 

This remarkable law has had many important applications, one of the 
principal of which is, the determining of the coefficients in the binomial 
formula. 

It is plain from what has been shown that, if we write in succession 
the number of combinations of m letters, taken 1 and 1, 2 and 2, . . . . 
n and n, we will have a series of numbers increasing to the middle term, 
and then repeated in retrograde order. 

Thus, 6 letters combined, 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3, 4 and 4, 5 and 5, 
give the series 6, 15, 20, 15, 6. In like manner, 7 letters give the 
scries, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7. The law of formation is precisely that 
which we have observed in the binomial development; and, in fact, in 
this development, the coefficients, after the second, are the combinations 
of m letters, taken 2 and 2, 3 and 3, &c., . . . . n and n. 

396. Let us now seek the greatest term of the series formed by com- 
bining m letters, 1 and 1, 2 and 2, .... n and n. The factors, which 

m — 1 TO — 2 m — 91 4- 1 
determine the successive terms, are — - — , — ^^ — , .... . 

&c. Now, since these numerators go on decreasing, and the denomi- 
nators increasing, it is evident that the successive products will go on 
increasing until w — n -\-l = n, and after that will decrease and be 
repeated in reverse order. Suppose m an odd number, then placing 
m — m -f- 1 = n, we get n r= ^ (m 4- 1). Now, if we include unity, 
the last term of the series, there will be m terms in all, and in case of m 
being odd, the n*"" term will obviously be even, and, of course, have an 
even number of terms preceding and succeeding it. Thus, in the series, 

7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1 ; « = —-, — = 4, will represent the 4th term, 

and we see that it has three terms before and three after it. It is plain, 

moreover, that tlie 7i^^ term, being formed from the (ji — l)*"" term by 

, . , . - , ,171 — n -{- 1 ^ . , , 

multiplying the latter by =1, is, also, equal to the (n — ] )<" 

term. 

Hence, when m is an odd number, there will be two equal central 



PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 383 

terms, the series will go on increasing unto the first of these, and 
decreasing from the second unto the last term, unity. Thus, the com- 
binations of 5 letters, taken 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3, 4 and 4, 5 and 
5, give the series 5, 10, 10, 5, 1. 

397. When m is even, the factors increase until n = J m. We can- 
not, in this case, have n z=z — - — , for that would make n fractional, a 

manifest absurdity. No factor, in this case, is unity, and, of course, 
there are no equal central terms. The terms go on increasing until 
n = ^m, and are then reproduced in reverse order. It is obvious that 

whenever n '^Im, the factor will become a proper fraction, 

and, of course, the term of the scries formed by multiplying the pre- 
ceding term by this factor, will be less than the preceding. Ten letters, 
taken 1 and 1, 2 and 2, &c., give the scries, 10, 45, 120, 210, 252, 
210, 120, 45, 10, 1. 

398. If we add together the values of C and ]), as found in Art. 
394, and at the same time make q = 2) — 1, wc will have C + I) = 
C + C(m-p-f l )^ C(m + l) ^ m-f 1 ^ ^ X - = / "^ + h 

p p 1 p \ 1 / 

(m \ tm — 1 V {jn — p + 3) {in — p -f 2) 

T/ V "3 / p — \ p ■ 

The second member of this equation plainly denotes the number of 
combinations of m + 1 letters, taken p andpj whilst the first member 
denotes the sum of the combinations of m letters, taken ^^ andp, and 
p — 1 and p — 1. This important relation enables us to get the number 
of combinations of m -}- 1 letters from that of m letters. Thus, make 
m = 4, p = 3, and p — 1 = 2, then 4 letters, taken 2 and 2, give 6 
combinations, and taken 3 and 3, give 4, and we find that 5, or m -f 1 
letters, taken p, or 3 in a set, give a number of combinations equal to 
4 + 6, or 10. 

399. Upon this principle, the following table (p. 384) has been con- 
structed. The first vertical column is made up of ones ; the second column 
contains the natural numbers from 1 to 20, and expresses the number of 
combinations of these numbers, taken 1 and 1; the other vertical 
columns express the combinations of the same numbers, taken 3 and 3, 
4 and 4, 5 and 5, &c. These vertical columns result from the hori- 
zontal, which are constructed according to the principle demonstrated 
in Article 398, observing that every horizontal column must close with 
unity. Thus, the numbers in the second horizontal column are 1, 2

and 1, the numbers in the next column are, 1 + 2 = 8, 2 + 1 = 3 
and 1, and express the number of combinations of three letters, taken 
1 and 1, 2 and 2, and 3 and 3. Now, prefix unity, and we have the 
third horizontal row made up of 1, 3, 3 and 1, and the fourth row will 
be made up of 1, 3 + 1 ^ 4, 3 + 3 = 6, 3 + 1 = 4 and 1, the last 
four numbers expressing the number of combinations of four letters, 
taken 1 dnd 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3, and 4 and 4. All the other horizontal 
columns are formed in the same manner.

400. We can now readily find the entire sum of the combinations 
formed by any number of letters, taken in every possible way. Let the 
numbers in the ^"' row be expressed hj 1, a h . . . m, m . . . b, a, 1; t 

being supposed an odd number. Then their sum will be 2 (o + 6 

-}- m + 1). The numbers in the next row will be expressed by 1 + a, 
a + i . . . . + . + m, + m + m . . . i + a, a + 1 and 1, and their sum 
will be 4 (a + h . . . + m + 1) + 1. Hence, the sum of the numbers in 
the (t + 1)'" column, will be double of the preceding, and one more. 
When t is an even number, the same law can be shown to be true 
But the sum of the numbers in the second horizontal column, is 2^ — 1 
Hence, in the third column, it will be 2 (2' — 1) + 1 = 2* — 1, and 
in the fourth, 2 (2='— 1) + 1 = 2^ — 1. And it is plain that, in the 
f" column it will be 2* — 1. It will be seen that the ones in the first 



PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 3S5 

vertical column are omitted. Hence, 2* — 1, espresses the sum of the 
combinations of t letters, taken 1 and 1, 2 and 2 .... t and t. Thus, 
to apply the formula, let it be required to determine the number of 
combinations of three letters, taken 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3. Then 
t =3, and 2* — 1 = 2=' — 1 = 8 — 1 = 7. This agrees with the 
fact, for the three letters, a, h, c, give us the seven combinations, u, 
h, c ; ah, ac, be, and ahr. So, likewise, the four letters, a, b, c, J, by 
the formula, give a number of combinations equal to 2^ — 1 =16 — 1 
= 15; and we, in fact, have a, b, c, d ; ab, ac, ad, be, bd, cd ; ahc, abd, 
acd, bed ; and abed. 

401. We will now deduce an analogous formula to the above, for the 
sum of the permutations of n letters, taken 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3, 
n and ?i, when each letter is combined with itself, so as to be taken t(j 
the second, third, fourth, and . . . n"" powers. 



PERMUTATIONS IN WIIICII THE LETTERS ARE REPEATED. 

Two letters, a and b, permuted in this way, give the four permuta- 
tions, aa, ab, ba, bb. Hence, the number of permutations of two let- 
ters, taken 2 and 2, when each letter is associated with itself, is equal 
to 2^. Three letters, a, b, c, give the nine permutations, aa, ab, ae, ba, 
ea, bb, be, cb, ce. Hence, the number of permutations of three letters, 
taken 2 and 2, is equal to 3^ Four lettci-s, a, b, c, d, give, when taken ' 

2 and 2, the sixteen permutations, aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, ca, da, bb, he, 
bd, ch, dh, cc, cd, de, dd. Hence, the number of permutations of four 
letters, taken 2 and 2, is equal to 4^. And, in general, it is plain that 
the number of permutations of n letters, taken 2 and 2, is equal to n^. 
We will next show that the number of permutations of n letters, taken 

3 and 3, is equal to n^. The three letters, a, h, and c, when permuted 
in this way, give the twenty-seven permutations, 

aaa, aah, aae, aba, baa, aca, eaa, ahc, cba ; 
hbh, bbc, bba, bcb, ebb, bah, abb, bac, hca ; 
cec, ccb, eca, cb.-, bee, eac, aec, cab, aeh. 

Hence, the number of permutations of three letters, taken 3 and 3, 
is equal to 3^ And, in general, of n letters, taken 3 and 3, the num- 
ber is 11^. In like manner, the number of permutations of n letters, 
taken 4 and 4, is expressed by W*. Hence, for the entire sum of the 
permutations, taken 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3 . . . . n and n, we have

PARTIAL PERMUTATION. 

' 402. Sometimes the nature of the problem is such, that some of the 
quantities cannot be permuted with each other. Thus, let it be re- 
quired to determine how many words of two letters each can be formed 
out of the letters a, e, c, d, admitting that the consonants associated 
together will not form a word. The formula for the number of per- 
mutations of m letters, taken n and n, gives us 4 (4 — 1) = 12. But 
we have to reject the number of permutations of two letters, c and (/, 
taken 2 and 2, or 2 (2 — 1) = 2. Hence, 12 — 2 = 10, the number 
of permutations that can be formed in the required manner. They

LOGARITHMS. 

403. Tlie logarithm of a quantity is the exponent of the power to 
which it is necessary to raise an invariable quantity, called the base, to 
produce the quantity. 

Let a be the invariable quantity or base, x its logarithm, and i/ the 
quantity given ; then, a^ = y. In this equation, x is the logarithm 
of 1/. It is usual to write logarithm, log., or simply, 1. Hence, 
X = log. y, or 1. 1/. We will begin the discussion by supposing a ^ 1, 
and X positive, and, though the general principles of logarithms are true 
for quantities as well as for numbers, yet, as iu practice the logarithms 
of algebraic quantities are seldom used, we will first show the relations 
between numbers and their logarithms. Resuming the equation, a* = y, 
we see that when i/ = 1, x = 0, for, a" =: 1. Hence, log. 1 = 0, and, 
since this will be so, whatever may be the value of a, we see that the 
log. 1 is always zero. Every value given to x, above zero, will cause 
1/ to increase more and more ; when a; = 1, ,?/ = a. When x has values 
attributed to it greater than 1, y will exceed a more and more, until 
x = CO gives also y = oo . Suppose, for instance, a = 8, then 
x = and x = 1 give y == 1 and y = S. Moreover, x = 1, 2, 3, 
4, &c., gives 1/ = 8, 64, 512, 4096, &c. Finally, a; = oo gives y = go , 
for, 8^" = CO . It is plain that, when x has an intermediate value 
between and 1, that y will have a value between 1 and 8, 
and that by making x pass through all possible positive values, 
entire and fractional, between and 1, and 1 and oo , y will be made 
to pass through all possible positive values between 1 and 8, and 
8 and cc . The contrary of what we have just seen will be the case 

when X is negative. For the equation, a~'' =y, will become — = y; and 

it is plain that, as x increases y will decrease, and that when x = cc , 
y = 0. To illustrate this, let a = 8, and let cr r=: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., 



LOGARITHMS. 391 

then, y = 1, |, g'j, ^jj, 4 g^g, &c. And it is evident that, by giving 
to X all possible positive values, entire and fractional, between U and oo , 
y may be made to pass through all possible positive values between 1 
and 0. Suppose now, a <^ 1. It will still be true that all possible 
values may be formed from the powers of one number, but the order of 
the numbers will be reversed. For values of ar, between the limits 
and — CO , we will get all possible positive numbers between 1 
and + 00 ; and for all values of x, between and + oc , we will get 
all possible positive numbers between 1 and 0. 

The remarkable fact that all positive numbers might be regarded as 
the powers of one invariable number, led to the invention of logarithmic 
tables by Napier, for the purpose of abridging complicated numerical 
calculations. The invariable number is called tlie base of the si/sfem of 
logarithms, and may evidently be any number whatever, except unity. 
Since all the powers of unity are unity, it is plain that this number 
cannot be taken as a base. The base of the common system of loga- 
rithms is 10. The powers of this number are more readily formed 
than the powers of any other number whatever, and this was the main 
reason for its selection. 

We have (10/ = 1, Hence, log. 1 =0, 

(10)' = 10, '' log. 10 =.1, 

(10)^=100, " log. 100 =2, 

(lOy = 1000, " log. 1000 = 3, 

&c. &c. 

We see that, as the number changes (the base being the same), the 
logarithm also changes. It is plain, moreover, that any change in the 
base, the number being unaltered, will produce a change in the loga- 
rithm. Thus, if the base is 12, since 12' = 12, we have log. 12 := 1. 
The logarithm of 10 in this system will then not be 1, as in the system 
whose base is 10, but will be some fractional number less than 1. 
Hence, we see that logarithms depend upon the number and upon the i 
base. That part of the logarithm in any system which depends upon 
the base is called the modulus of the system. A table of loijarithms is a 
table exhibiting the logarithms of all numbers between certain limits, 
as and 100, or and 10000, calculated to a particular base. 

The general properties of logarithms are independent of any particular j 
base. A few of these general properties will now be demonstrated. 



392 LOGARITHMS. 



First Property. 

404. The logarithm of the product of any number of factors taken 
in the same system, is equal to the sum of the logarithms of those 
factors. 

For, let a represent the base of the system, y, y', ?/', y'", &c., several 
numbers, and x, x', x", x'", &c., their corresponding logarithms. Then, 
cv^ = y, o"' =: y' , a"" = y", a""" = y"', &c. Multipl3'ing these equa- 
tions together, member by member, we have 0^+^'+""+^'"+ ^'- z=i y ij y" y'" , 
&c. Then, since the exponent of the base is (from the definition) the 
logarithm of the second member, we have x + x' + x" + a;"' + &c. 
= log. yy'y"^", &c. But the first equations give x = log. y, x' = 
log. y', x' = log. y", &c. Hence, log. y -\- log. y' + log. y" + log :!/"' 
+ &c. = log yy'y"y"' &c., as enunciated. Then, since the logarithm 
of the product of any number of factors is equal to the sum of the 
logarithms of these factors, it follows that to multiply by means of loga- 
rithms, we have only to add together the logarithms of the factors, and 
to find the number corresponding to this sum. This number will be 
the product required. Thus, let it be required to multiply 100 by 10, 
by means of logarithms. The log of 100 is 2, in a system whose base 
is 10 ; the log of 10 is 1 ; the sum of these logarithms, 3, is the loga- 
rithm of the product. Look for the number corresponding to 3 as a 
logarithm, and you will have 1000 as the product required. To exhibit 
the whole in an equation, we have, log. 100 x 10 = log. 100 -f log. 10 
= 2-1-1 = 3; the number corresponding to which is 1000. 

We have, then, for multiplication by means of logarithms, this 

RULE. 

Add toycther the logarithms of the several factors. This sum will he 
equal to the logarithm of the product. Looh in the table of logarithms 
for the number corresponding to this logarithm, and you loill have the 
product required.

Ans. Log. (a + i)" + ^og. c" + log. d^. 



Second Projperty. 

405. The logarithm of the quotient arising from dividing one quan- 
tity by another is equal to the logarithm of the dividend minus the 
logarithm of the divisor. For, let x equal the quotient of two quan- 

11 ^''^ 4 1-1 

titles, m and n, then x = — , or nx = m. And, since, when two 
n 

quantities are equal their logarithms must be equal, we have log. nx 
= log. m, or log. n + log. x = log. w. Hence, log. x = log. m — log. 
n, as enunciated. From this we derive for division, by means of loga- 
rithms, the following 

RULE. 

From the logarithm of (he dividend subtract the logarithm of the 
divisor; the remainder will be the logarithm of the quotient. The 
number in the table corresponding to this logarithm will be the quotient 
required. 

Thus, to find the quotient of 1000 by 10, we have log. 1000 — log. 10 
= 3 — 1 = 2, and the number corresponding to 2 as a logarithm is 
100.

G. Find the equivalent expression to log. (- V 

Ans. Log. (« + i) — log. c. 



Third Property, 

406. The logarithm of the power of a number is equal to the expo- 
nent of the power into the logarithm of the number. 

For, take the equation, as=y, and raise both members to the m*" 
power, we will have a"^ = 3/° (A). In equation (A), m is any number 
whatever, positive or negative, entire or fractional. But, since the 
exponent of the base is the logarithm of the second member, equation 
(A) gives mx = log. ?/™ ; and the first equation gives x = log. y. 
Hence, m log. y = log. ?/■", or log y"^ = m log. y, as enunciated. It 
follows, then, that to raise a number to a power by means of logarithms, 
we have only to apply this 

RULE. 

Multiply the logaritlim of the numher, as found in the tahic, hy the 
exponent of the poioer to which it is to be raised. This product xciJl he 
the logarithm of the poioer, a7id the number found in the table corres- 
ponding to this logaritlim loill he the required poioer. 

Thus, to raise 10 to the second power by means of logarithms, we 
multiply the logarithm of 10, which is 1, by 2, the exponent of the 
power. The product, 2, is the logarithm of the power, and the number 
corresponding to this logarithm is 100. So that we have log. (10)^ = 
2 log. 10 = 2 ; the number corresponding to which is 100.

Fourth Properti/. 

407. The logarithm of the root of a number is equal to the logarithm 
of the number divided by the index of the root. 

For, take the equation, a^ = y, and extract the m"" root of both 

X 3j 

members. Then, Va" = '</,?/, or, a^ ='y/y- Hence, — =log. Vy 

(A.), the exponent of the base being the logarithm of the second 
member. But the first equation gives x = log. y ; equation (A) then 

becomes log. ^— = log. "V'y, or log. ly v = log. ^—, as enunciated. 

in "- m 

For extracting roots by means of logarithms we have, therefore, this 



RULE. 

D'lcide the logarithm of the number, lohose root is to be extracted, by 
the index of the root. The quotient toill be the logarithm of the root; 
the number found in the table, corresponding to this logarithm, will be 
the root required. 

Thus, to extract the square root of 100 by means of logarithms, we 
divide 2, the logarithm of 100, by 2, the index of the root. The quo-

tient, 1, is the logarithm of the root, aud 10, the number con-espoudiug 
to this logarithm, is the root required.

408. Since, a° = 1, it matters not what is the value of a, and, since the 
equation, a° = 1, gives = log. 1, it follows that the logarithm of unity 
in every system of logarithms is equal to zero. From this we readily 
deduce the 

Fifth Property. 

The logarithm of the reciprocal of a number is equal to the loga- 
rithm of the number taken negatively. 

For, let N bo the number, then -r^ will be the reciprocal of the num- 
ber, and we have log. ^ = log. 1 — log. N = — log. N = — log. N, 
as enunciated.

Corollary. 

409. "When a ^ 1, we have a" = oo . Hence, oo = log. x . That 
is, the logarithm of infinity in a system, whose base is greater than unity, 

is, itself, infinity. And, since = — , it follows from the fifth property, 

that log. = — -x. . That is, the logarithm of zero in a system, whose 
base is greater than unity, is minus infinity. 

When a <^ J^, a number, y^ for example, it is plain that the base 
must be raised to a power denoted by — oc, in order to produce in- 
finity. Thus, (j'jj)"" = r-f^ = (10)=^ = X . Hence, the logarithm 

of infinity in a system, whose base is less than unity, is minus infinity. 
Hence, by the fifth property, the logarithm of zero in a system whose 
base is less than 1, is plus infinity. Thus, it is plain that (jjj)°° = 0, 
from which oo = I02;. 0. 



Sixth Propertij. 

■110. The logarithm of any base, taken in its own S3-stcm, is unity. 

For, suppose there are any number of bases, a, h, c, &c., and desig- 
nate the logarithms in the systems, of which these are the bases, by 
log. log.' log." &c. We have a' = a, i' = h, c' = c, &c. Hence, 
1 = log. a, 1 = log.' 6, 1 = log.' c, &c. 

Thus, 1 is the logarithm of 10 in a system whose base is 10. But, 
in the system whose base is 8, the logarithm of 10 must be greater 
than 1. Because, 8' = 8, or 1 = log. 8. Hence, a number greater 
than 1 must be the logarithm of 10. 

Seventh Principle. 

411. If we have a table of logarithms calculated to a particular base, 
the logarithms of the numbers in this table, divided by the logarithm 
of a second base, taken in the first system, will give, as quotients, the 
logarithms of the same numbers in the second system. 
34 



SnS T.OGAIUTIIMS. 

For, let fl* =;/, and i^ = ?/. Then a* = i'- (A). Distinguish the 

logarithms of the two systems by log. and log.'. Taking the log. of both 

members of (A), we have x log. a = z log. h. But, since x = log. y, 

and z = log'. ;y, and log. a =1, this equation becomes log. 1/ = log.'y, 

lo"". 1/ 
lotr. i. Then log.' y = , ^ ' , as enunciated. 
^ ^ "^ log. 6 

412. The two systems in most common use are the Napierian, whose 
base is 2.718281828, and the common, whose base is 10. Suppose 
the Napierian logarithms to be designated by log.', and the common by 
log. Then, if we knew the common logarithm of any number, we can 
get the Napierian logarithm of the same number, by dividing the 
common logarithm of the number by the common logarithm of the 
Napierian base; or we can get the common logarithm of a number, 
knowing its Napierian logarithm, by multiplying the Napierian logarithm 
by the common logarithm of the Napierian base. 



DIFFERENTIAL OF a'. 

413. The Binomial Formula enables us to find the differential of a'. 
For, let u = a^, and give x an increment, h. Then, tt' = a'^^^ = a'^a}', 
and u' — u = a^^a}" — 1). Let a = 1 -}- b, and develop o'' by the 

binomial fonnula, we will have a^ = (1 -f &)'' = 1 + hh + -^ — -^^ 

+ 'ii^2M*^^. .. ^ ,. + .(„_| + |_| +1). 

by neglecting the higher powers of h, as infinitely small quantities of 
the second order and higher orders. But, since h = a — 1, we have 

a" = 1 + /i( (a — 1) — ^^iizl^' + illzlT — Sic.) = 1 + mi, by 

designating the quantity within the parenthesis by N. Hence, u' — u 
z=a^(ci^ — 1) = a'^N/i, and du = a^'Ndx = iiNdx; from which 

dx = -^. — ■ And, since u = a^, we have x = log. m, and dx = 

N M '' 

(^(log. «). Moreover, since a is the base, and N depends entirely upon 
a, we see that the differential of a logarithm is equal to the reciprocal 
of a constant, dependent upon the base into the differential of the 
quantity divided by the quantity.

LOGARITHMIC SERIES. 

414. A logarithmic series is one which will enable us to calculate 
approximatively the logarithms of any number whatever. We have seen 
that the logarithm of a number depends, 1st, on the number ; 2d, on 
the base. Hence, the development of a logarithm must contain the \ 
number, or some quantity dependent upon the number, and some / 
quantity dependent upon the base. These two facts serve as a guide 
in assuming the form of development. Suppose we have the equation, 
a' = x, in which x is the number, and i/ the logarithm. Let us 
assume log. a; = A + A'.r -|- A'V + A"'x' + &c., in which A, A', 
A", &c., arc independent of x, and dependent upon the base, a. Now, 
if we make .r = 0, the first member becomes infinite, whilst the second 
reduces to a finite quantity, A. The assumed form is then wrong. 
Again, assume log. x = Kx + A'x + A'V + &c. Making x = 0, 
we get ± Qo = 0, which is absurd. The development then cannot be 
made under the second form. An examination of the two forms shows 
that we have assumed the logarithm to be developed in the powers of 
the number, and we have seen that it cannot be so developed. Since

Since (1 + ic), the number whose logarithm is developed, has been 
expanded in the powers of x ; we conclude that, though the logarithm 
of a number cannot be developed in the powers of the number, it may 
be in the powers of a number less by unity. 

Since N = (a — 1) — ^^ — - — - + - — ^ — -, &c., in which a is the 

base of the system, it is plain that the factor, — , in equation (P), depends 

for its value upon the base alone. Equation (P) shows, moreover, 
that the logarithm of a number is composed of two factors, one 
dependent upon the base alone, and the other dependent upon the 
number alone. The factor which depends upon the base for its value 
is called the modulus of the system . The modulus is usually represented 
by M, or M'. 

415. If we take the logarithm of (1 + ic), in a system whose base 
is a' , and denote the new logarithm by log.', it is plain that the new 
development will differ from the first only in this notation and in the 
}nodulus. Hence, we will have 

log. (1 + ..:) --= M(r _ l' + f' - |V -f - &c.), and 

log.' (1 + .0 = M'(.- - I + ^-^ + ^- &c.). 
Hence, log. (1 + x) : log.' (1 + x) : : M : M'. 
That is, the logarithms of the same mtmher in tioo different systems 
are to each other as the modtdi of these systejns. • 



LOGARITHMS. 401 

416. Since the modulus is expressed in terms of the base, it follows 
that if the base be given, the modulus can be determined, and con- 
versely, the base can be found from the modulus. 

If, then, we make M' = 1, the base of the system will become knowu 
The system of logarithms, whose modulus is unity, is called Napierian 
from Lord Napier, the inventor of logarithms. The base of the system 
calculated from the assumed modulus, is 2-718281828. 



COMMON AND OTHER LOGARITHMS FOUND FROxM

417. The proportion, log. (I + x) : log'. (1 + a;) : : M : M', be- 
comes, when M' = l, log. (1 + x) : log'. (1 -f a:-) : M : 1. Hence, we 
have log. (1 + »•) = M log'. (1 -f x) (A). 

This equation shows that the Napierian logarithm of any number, 
muUiplied hy the modulus of any other system, loill give the logarithm 
of the same numher in that system. Moreover, equation (A), compared 
with the 7th Property, shows that the viodulus of any system is equal to 
the logarithm of the Napierian base of that system. 



MEASURE OF ANY MODULUS. 

418. Let a be the base of any system, and let the logarithms of this 
system be designated by log., and those of the Napierian by log'. Let 
(1 + x) be any number, then the 7th Property will give log. (1 -i- x) 

= - — J — log'. (1 + x) (B). Equation (B) compared with (A) shows 

that M = , — } — . Hence, the measure of the modulus of any system 

is equal to the reciprocal of the Napierian logarithm of the base of that 
system. 

This measure is even true for the Napiarian modulus itself, for we

Making x = 1, we have, ^2 = 1 — i + J — i + i — i + &c. 

This series enables us to calculate the Napierian logarithm of 2, and, 
by making x = 2,S, 4, 5, &c., we can calculate the Napierian logarithm 
of 3, 4, 5, 6, &c. But the series does not converge rapidly enough, 
because, for every number greater than 2, the series goes on increasing 
continually, and it would be necessary to take an infinite number of 
terms in order to make the calculation in any degree correct. A simple 
artifice will enable us to convert the above series into a converging one, 
that is, into a series in which the terms will become smaller and smaller; 
so that all after a certain number may be neglected without aifecting 
the result materially. Two transformations are used to aficct this con- 
vergence. 

First Transformation. 
420. Make x =z - \\\ equation (C), it will become 

-^+&c.,(D). 

This series will become more converging as y increases. 
Making y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c., in succession, we get 

>2 — n=r2 = i — ^ + J — J + i — i + &c., 

Z'4 = Z'3 + i- J3 + hV- 3k + T2V7r-&c., 
/'5 = Z'4 + 1 — 3^. + ih — TTR4 + i,~ho — &c- 

The first series enables us to calculate the Napierian logarithm of 2. 
The second series enables us to calculate the Napierian logarithm of 3 
when that of 2 is known ; and the formula, evidently, only can be used 
when the logarithm of the next lowest number is known. 



Second Transformation. 

421. The preceding formula does not give a sufficiently converging 
series for small numbers. A better series can bo obtained in the fol-

lowing manner. In the equation, ?'(! + x) ^=x — tt -^ o r +

in (E) by this value, we get ^'(1 + -), or I' (I + z) — l' z=2 (- - 

verges more rapidly than (D), and will answer even for small numbers. 
Let z = l,2, o, 4, 5, 6, &c., we will have 

re - « = 2 (i + -1^ + ^^ + ^-2_ + _2_ + fe. 

f6 — ?5 = 2(T'r + 8(ir)+5Tn)»+f(Tl)'+9(TT7+ll(nv' 
+ &c.) 

1. For small numbers it is necessary to take a good many terms of 
this series, but when the numbers are large one or two terms will 

answer. Thus, let a- = 1000, then nOOl—nOOO =2(5 J^-j- + o-oiTr-.^., 
+ FrF^jK(yf\5 + ^cV We see that the fi;-st term of this series will 

only add about jq^^o *° *^^ logarithm of 1000, and the second term 
will add less than godoFoo^oo- And, since logarithms are seldom 



404 LOGARITHMS. 

carried further than the Tth place of decimals, all the terms after the 
first may be neglected. 

2. In constructing a table it is only necessary to calculate the loga- 
rithms of prime numbers, since the logarithm of any number made up 
of factors is equal to the sum of the logarithms of its factors. Thus, 
no = n + I'b, Z'12 = Z'3 + Z'4 = Z'3 + 2Z'2, &c. 

3. Knowing the Napierian logarithm of 10, we can fiud the modulus 
of the common system. For, log.' 10 : log. 10 : : 1 : M. Hence, 

M = -^rrcT ' ^^^ ^*-*S- 1^ "= ^^ ^"^^ *'^® calculated value of log.' 10 is 

2.302585093. Therefore, M = ^ oaolo^ac,^ = 0-434294482. 

If we now multiply the Napierian logarithms found from the series 
by this modulus, we will have a table of common logarithms. 



ADA^ANTAGES OF THE COMMON SYSTEM. 

422. 1. A fixed law for the characteristic. 

The characteristic of a logarithm is its entire part. Thus, 2 is the 
characteristic in the logarithm 2-302585093. 

Whatever may be the base of the system, the logarithms of the 
powers of that base will contain no decimals, and, therefore, be charac- 
teristics only. Thus, let 7 be the base, then the log. 7 — 1, 
log. 49 = 2, &c. 

In the common system, with the base 10, we have log. 10 = 1, 
log. 100 = 2, log. 1000 = 3, &c., and we see that the characteristic is 
always one less than the number of figure places in the number. This 
is true, whether the number be an exact power of the base or not ; 
thus, 512, lying between 100, whose logarithm is 2, and 1000, whose 
logarithm is 3, has for its logarithm 2 and a certain decimal. Now, 
10 is the only number in the whole range of numbers, which, taken as 
a base, will give logarithms whose characteristics are formed according 
to a fixed law. 

In a table of common logarithms, the characteristics are not written, 
since they are always one less than the mimher of figures in the given 
numbers. 

2. A tahle of logarithms for decimals need not be constructed. 

Since, Log. -1 = log.* -J^ = log. 1 — log. 10 = — 1. 
Log. -01 = log. jJ = ^og- 1 — 'og. 100 = — 2. 
Log. -001 = log. j-^oT) = log- 1 — log. 1000 = — 3. 



LOGARITHMS. 405 

And, since, in general, log. := log. 1 — m log. 10 = — m, it is 

plain tliat the characteristic of a decimal is negative, and one greater 
than the number of ciphers between the decimal point and the first 
significant figure. This is true, also, when the decimal is not the re- 
ciprocal of some power of the base. Thus, log. -08 = log. -f^ = log. 
8 — log. 10 = a decimal — unity. Hence, the log. -08 must have a 
negative characteristic equal to minus unity. Moreover, if we have a 
decimal, such as -00278 = jxhhj1)0' ^^ ^^'^ ^^^'^ 'og- '00278 = log. 
278 — log. 100000. And, since log. 278 is 2 whole number, plus a cer- 
tain decimal; and, since the log. 100000 is 5, the log -00278 = — 3, 
whole number plus a certain decimal. We see, from this example, that the 
logarithm of a decimal is obtained by regarding the decimal as a whole 
number, and prefixing a negative characteristic, one greater than the num- 
ber of ciphers, between the decimal point and the first significant figure. 
The foregoing reasoning can be extended to any decimal whatever, be- 
cause, change the decimal into an equivalent vulgar fraction, it will be 
seen that the number of figure places in the denominator exceed those 
in the numerator by one more than the number of ciphers between the de- 
cimal point and the first significant figure of the given decimal. Now, if 
the base were any other number whatever than 10, it is plain that a table 
of logarithms for whole numbers would not be applicable to decimals. 

3. The logarithm of a mixed decimal, such as 42-733, can he found 
from a table of logarithms constructed to the base 10, b^ regarding the 
mixed number as a whole number, and prefixing to the decimal p«r< 
(f the logarithm found in the table a characteristic one less than the 
number of figure places in the entire p)art of the mixed number. 

For, log. 42-733 = log. *f^^\^ = log. 42733 — log. 1000 = 4 + 
a certain decimal — 3 = 1 + a decimal. 

The foregoing rule for finding the logarithm of a mixed number can 
evidently be applied to any mixed number whatever. 

4. The logarithms of numbers which difi"er only in the number of 
annexed ciphers, will differ only in their characteristics. 

Thus, the logarithms of 125, 1250, 12500, and 125000, difi'er only 
in their characteristics. For, log. 1250 = log. 10 -f log. 125 = 1 -f- 
log. 125 ; log. 12500 = log. 100 -f log. 125 = 2 -|-log. 125 ; log. 125000 
= log. 1000 + log. 125 = 3 -f log. 125. 

This property of common logarithms is very important, since it saves 
the trouble (as will be seen more fully hereafter) of constructing a table 
for numbers whose figure places exceed four.

APPLICATION OF COMMON LOGAPJTIIMS. 

423. The base of the coiniuon system being 10, the characteristic or 
entire part of the logarithms need not be written iu the tables, since, as 
we have seen, it is always one less than the number of figure places iu 
the given number. The decimal parts of the logarithms are then only 
written in the tables, and are generally carried as far as six places. 
The first vertical column on the left in the tables, contains the given 
numbers ; the last vertical column, marked D, contains the tabular dif- 
ference corresponding to two given logarithms, and is constructed by a 
method hereafter to be explained. The intermediate vertical columns, 
marked at top, 0, 1, 2, 3, &c., contain the decimal parts of logarithms. 

The following table exhibits the logarithms and numbers between 100 
and 130. When the given number contains four figure places, the

first three will be found in the first vertical column on the left, and the 
fourth must be sought at the top of the page, among the numbers be- 
tween and 9, inclusive. Thus, 121 may be found in the first vertical 
column on the left, and the last figure of 1215 will be found in the 
column marked 5 at top. The logarithm of 121 is written just oppo- 
site to it iu the column marked 0; 1210 will obviously have the same 



LOGARITHMS. 407 

decimal part of its logaritlim, but a characteristic greater by unity ; the 
logarithm of 1215, on the other hand, must not only exceed the loga- 
rithm of 121 in characteristic, but also in decimal part, and its decimal 
part is then taken from the column marked 5. 

TO FIND THE LOGARITHM OF A GIVEN NUMBER BELOW 10,000. 

424. When the number is less than 100, the decimal part of the 
logaritlim is found in the table just opposite the given number. The 
characteristic will be determined by the number of figure places in the 
number. For numbers above 100 and below 10,000, we have the 
following 

RULE. 

Loohfor the first three figures of the given number in the column 
marked N, and if it contains hut three, the decimal part of its loga- 
rithm icill he found Just ojijmsite these three figures in the column 
marked 0. But if there are only four figures in this column, opposite 
the given numher, the two left hand figures above, in the same column, 
where six figures aretcritten, must he prefixed to the four figures found. 
Thus, the decimal part of the logarithm of 110, is 041398, and the 
entire logarithm, 20i1SdS. The decimal 2mrt of the logarithm of 
112 is Oid-218, the first tu-o figures being found opposite 110. The 
entire logarithm is then 2-049218. The logarithm of 117 is 2-06816, 
and of 120, 2079181. 

425. When the given number contains four figures, look for the first 
three in the column marked N. The last four of the decimal part of 
its logarithm will be found just opposite, in the column marked at top 
by the fourth figure. To these four figures must be prefixed two deci- 
mals in the column marked zero, either found opposite the first three 
figures, or above, where six figures occur. Thus, to get the logarithm 
of 1213, we first find 121 in the first column, and then look just oppo- 
site, in the column marked 3, where we find 3801, and prefix to it 08, 
taken from the column marked 0. Hence, the logarithm of 1213 is 
8-083861. The logarithm of 1283 is 3-108227, the two left hand 
figures of its decimal part being found above, where six figures occur. 

When, however, we pass over a decimal with a point prefixed, the 
first two figures are to be found below, and not above. Thus, the loga- 
rithm of 1234 is 3-091315. In like manner, the logarithm of 1231 
is 3-090258. The place of the point is always supplied by zero. If 



408 LOGARITHMS. 

the left hand figures were not taken below, the logarithm of 1231, 1232, 
&c., would be less than the logarithm of 1230, 1229, &c.

TO FIND THE LOGAPJTIOI OF A NUMBER ABOVE 10,000. 

426. Cut off on the right all the figures, except the first four of the 
highest denomination. Find the decimal part of these four left hand 
figures, as before, and prefix a characteristic, one less than the number of 
figure places in the given number previous to cutting off. jNIultiply 
the tabular difference by the figures cut off on the right, and from this 
product cut off as many places for decimals as there are figure places in 
the multiplier. Add the result to the logarithm before found. Thus, 
to find the logarithm of 129451, we cut off 51, and find the decimal 
part of 1294 to be 111934. To this we prefix a characteristic, 5, and 
we have 5-111934, which is truly the logarithm of 129400 (Art. 422). 
Next, we multiply the tabular difference, 335, by 51, and cut off 85 
from the product, 17085 ; we would then have 170 to add to 5-111934 ; 
but, as -85 is greater than |, we increase 170 by 1, because 171 is 
nearer to 170-85 than is 170. Adding then 171, we have 5-112105 
for the logarithm of 129451. In general, whenever the decimal cut 
off' in the product, which results from multiplying the tabular difference 
by the right hand figures of the given number, exceeds ^, the last 
figure of the entire part of the product must be increased by 1. 

The explanation of the process is simple. The tabular diffe- 
rence expresses the difference between the logarithms of consecutive 



LOGARITHMS. 409 

numbers. Thus, the logarithm of 1293 is 3-1599 ; and of 1294 is 
3-1934, and their difference, 335, is written in the column marked D. 
This column, it is plain, will moreover express the difference between 
the logarithms of numbers which differ by 10, 100, 1000, &c. "We 
have seen that the logarithm of 129400 was 5-11934, but we were 
required to find the logarithm of 129451, and it remains to be seen how 
much the logarithm of 129400 is to be increased. We employ the 
principle, that the difference between any two numbers is to the difference 
of their logarithms, as the difference between any two other numbers is 
to their difference of logarithm. Hence, 129400 — 129300 : 335 : : 
129451 — 129400 : x, or 100 : 335 : : 51 : z, in which x represents 
the augment to the logarithm of 129400, to give the logarithm of 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Required the logarithm of 1309958. Ans. 6-117259. 

In this example three places arc cut off for decimals, because we took 
the difference between 1309000 and 1308000. The first term of the 
proportion was then 1000. 

2. Required the logarithm of 13080000. Ans. 7-116608. 

3. Required the logarithm of 13087654. Aiis. 7-116862. 

TO FIND A NUMBER CORRESPONDING TO A GIVEN 
LOGARITHM. 

427. When the decimal part of the logarithm can be found in the 
tables, the first three places of the required number will be found on 
the left, immediately opposite this logarithm, and in the column marked 
N. The fourth figure, which is to be annexed to the three already found, 
is to be taken from the number of the column in which the decimal 
part of the logarithm was written. Then point off, from the left of the 
number thus obtained, one more place for the entire part, than is indi- 
cated by the number of units in the characteristic. Thus, the number 
corresponding to the logarithm 2-107888 is 128-2, and to 1-107888 is 
12-82. So, the number corresponding to the logarithm 3-088136 is 
1225, and contains no decimal part. 

But, when the decimal part cannot be exactly found, take the next 
less logarithm from the tables, and subtract this from the given loga-

410 LOGARITHMS. 

ritlim. Annex two or more ciphers to this difference, and divide by 
tlic tabular difference. Annex the quotient to the number correspond- 
ing to the next less logarithm, and you will have the required number. 
Thus, let it be required to find the number corresponding tS the lo- 
garithm 4-1132800. The next less logarithm is 4-1132750, and the 
corresponding number 12980 ; annexing 4 ciphers to 50, the difference 
of logarithms, and dividing by 335, the tabular difference, we have a 
<luotient, 149, which is to be annexed as a decimal to 12980. Hence, 
the number sought is 12980-149. It is plain that we may annex as 
many ciphers as we please to the difference of logarithms. The pro- 
cess just described being the reverse of the preceding, requires no ex- 
planation.

Remarks. 

When only one cipher has to be annexed to the difference between 
the given and next less logarithm, to make it divisible by the tabular 
difference, no cipher is prefixed to the quotient. But when, (as in 
example 5), two ciphers must be annexed to make the division possible, 
then one cipher must be prefixed to the quotient. And when, (as in 
example 3), three ciphers must be annexed, two must be prefixed to the 
quotient. And, in general, the number of ciphers prefixed is one less 
than the number of ciphers annexed, to make the division possible.

SOLUTION OF EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS BY MEANS OF 
LOGARITHMS.

2. Required the value of x in the equation, 12^ = 13. 

Ans. 1-032. 

For, k)g. 13 = 1-113943 I log. 1-113943 :== 0-046862 
and, log. 12 = 1-079181 | log. 1-079181 := 033094

Ans. X = 1-048455. 

6. Required the value of x. in the equation, 11* = 11. 

Ans. a: = 1. 

For, log. X = log. log. 11 — log. log. 11 = log. 1-041393 — log. 
1-041393 ^ 0-017614 — 0-017614 = 0. Now, since log. x = ^,x 
must be unity. 

The result in this case might have been anticipated, but we have 
carried out the process to show its truthfulness. 



ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION. 

429. Quantities, which increase or decrease by a common diffe- 
rence, are said to be in Arithmetical Progression. 

Thus, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c., constitute an arithmetical progression, the 
common difference being 2. In like manner, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 constitute, 
also, an arithmetical progression, the common difference being 2. 
When, as in the first case, the common difference is an increment, the 
series is called ascending ; and when, as in the second case, the com- 
mon difference is a decrement, the series is called descending. The 
quantities, a, a -\- d, a -\- 2d, a + 3c7, &c., constitute an ascending 
series; and a, a — d, a — 2(7, a — oc7, constitute a descending series. 



ARITHxMETICAL PROGRESSION. 413 

It is evident, likewise, that the quantities, a + 3(7, a -\- 2d, a + d, a, 
form a descending series ; and, in general, an ascending series, when 
read in reverse order, becomes a descending series, and conversely. 

It is plain that the natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, &c., are in 
arithmetical progression, the common diiference being 1. 

It is plain that, if we know any term of an ascending series, we can 
find the succeeding term by adding to the known term the common 
difference. And, if we wish to find the term succeeding any known 
term of a decreasing series, we have only to subtract the common diffe- 
rence from the known term. In this manner, we may find any term 
of a series by a continued addition or subtraction of the common 
difference. But, as in a long series, this process would be tedious, 
it becomes necessary to deduce a formula by which any term, as 
the 71*^, may be found without going through a tedious addition or 
subtraction. 

FORMULA FOR THE Kth TERM. 

430. The second term of the ascending series, a, a -\- d, a + 2d, 
&c., is a + d ; that is, the common difference is added to the first term 
one less number of times than the place of the term. The third term 
is a -f 2d; that is, the first term is increased by the common difference, 
taken once less than the place of the term. We discover the same law 
of formation in regard to the fourth term, and all succeeding terms. 
Hence, calling, the n^^ term /, wc have / = a -f (ii — l)d ; that is, 
the n*"* term is equal to the first term, increased hy the common diffe- 
rence, taken once less than the jyJace of the term. 

If the series is decreasing, d is negative, and the formula becomes 
7 = a — (n — V)d. The first formula includes the second ; and the 
first, therefore, is only necessary, care being taken to attribute to d its 
proper sign. 

For an ascending series the first term is always the least, and for a 
descending series the first term is always the greatest. 

The foregoing formula, l=za -\- (n — V)d, may be used to obtain 
the last term, for n may represent any term whatever. When the com- 
mon difference is equal to the first term, that is, d = a, then, l=za 
-f na — a = na. The n^^ term is then equal to the first term into 
the number of terms. When the number of terms is unity, that is, 
n = 1, then. l=za, as it ought to be.

FORMULA FOR THE FIRST TERM. 

431. The formula, I = a + (n — V)d, contains four quantities, and, 
of course, if any three are given, the fourth can be determined. By 
transposition and reduction, we have a = 1 — (?i — V)d. That is, the 
first term is equal to the last, or n*"* tet-m, m inns the number of terms, 
less one, 'into the common difference. 

The formula is applicable both to an ascending and to a descending 
series, by attributing the proper sign to d.

difference 3. Required the first term. Ans. 2.

FORMULA FOE THE COMMON DIFFERENCE. 
432. From the formula, I = a + (n — l)c7, we get d = , that 

is, the common difference is equal to the last term, viinus the first term, 
divided hy the number of terms less one. 

For a descending series, d is negative, and, by multiplying both 

members by minus unity, we get d = -, that is, the common dif- 
ference of a descending series 'is equal to the first term, minus the last 
term, divided hy the number of terms less one When I =z a, d will be 
zero, as it ought to be. When n = 1, d = cc. The symbol of absurdity 
ought to appear under the hypothesis n := 1 ; for, when there is but 
one term, there can be no common diiFerencc, and therefore the assump- 
tion of its existence is absurd.

3. The last term is 12, the first term 1, and the number of terms 4. 
Required the common difference. Ans. y . 

FORMULA FOR THE NUMBER OF TERMS. 

433. From I = a -\- (n — l)d, we get n = 1 -| — , that is, the 

number of terms is equal to unity, added to the quotient arising from 
dividing the difference between the first and last terms by the common 
difference. 

The formula is applicable to a decreasing series, by attributing the 
appropriate sign to d; when I = a, n will be equal to 1, when d = 0, 
n = cc .

FORMULA FOR THE SUM OF THE TERMS. 

434. We might get the sum of the terms by actually performing the 
addition ; but, when the series contains many terms, this operation would 
be difficult, and we are enabled to deduce a formula which abridges the 
work. This formula is deduced from the remarkable property of an 
arithmetical progression, that the sum of any two terms at equal distance 
from the two extremes is equal to the sum of the two extremes. To 
show this, any term, as the m^^, counting from the first term, will be 
expressed by a -|- (m — l)c7, and the m^^ term, counting from the right, 
will be expressed by I — (m — l)d; and the sum of these terms is 
plainly a + I, a denoting the first term and I the last term. 

Calling S the sum of the terms, we have S'=a+ (a + <:?) + (« + 2(7) 
+ (a + 3(7) -\- (a + 4d) .... to 7, and reversing the series, S — 
/-j-(I — d) + (I — 2(7) + (7 — 3(7) . . . to rt. Adding these equations 
member by member, we get 2S = (a + 7) + (a + 7) + (a + 7) 4- 
&c., up to 71 terms. 

Hence, 2s = (a + 7)«, or s = ^^ — , that is, the sum of the 

terms is equal to the half sum of the first and last terms, into the num- 
her of terms. 

When 11 = 2, s = a -{-I, as it ought to be. When 7 = a, s = na, 
the common difference is then zero. When ?i= 4, s ^ 2 (a -|- I), as it 
ought to be. When ?i = 0, s = 0, as it ought to be. 

The sum of the terms can be determined when a, I and n are known, 
or can be found from the data.

Ans. ^ = l\2l—{n — V)d\n. 



TO FIND THE ARITHMETICAL MEAN. 

435. The arithmetical mean between several quantities, is the quo- 
tient arising from dividing their sum by their number. The arithmeti- 
cal mean between two quantities, m and w, is half their sum, that is, 
i (m + n). We have seen that a geometric mean between two quantities 
is the square root of their product. 

From the definition, the arithmetical mean between any number of 

terms in progression must be — = ^ = J (a -j- ?), that is, the 



arithmetical mean is equal to the half sum of the extremes. 



Corollary. 

The first and last terms may be found when the arithmetical mean, 
the number of terms, and the common difi"erence, are known. 

For, from S = ^^ , we get a = (a + {n — 1) d), or 

a = 2^l — a — {n — r)d. Hence, a = M — ^^^^=^. 

And since Z = a + {n — V)d, we get Z = M + ^^ 

The employment of the arithmetical mean frequently facilitates 
the solution of a problem in progression.

The last 


value being rejected, 



we have d^= + i. Hence, d = ziz2. The positive value will give 
a = 5 — |fZ = 2; and the second term, 4; the third, 6; the fourth, 8. 
The negative value of d will give the series in reverse order, and we 
see here a change of sign followed by a change of direction. 

The same problem might be solved by making 2x the common dif- 
ference, and 7/ — Sx, the smaller extreme. Then the 4 terms will be 
represented by y — 3a;, y — x, y -\- x, and y + Sx. And we have the 
two equations, ^ — 3x+y — x + 1/ + x +3/+3x = 4y = 20, and 
(ij — Sx) (y + Sx) {9/ — X) (y + x) = (f — 9x') (/_^2) =y_ 
lOa^y + 9x* = 384. Substituting, in this last equation, the value of 
y drawn from the first, we get 625 — 250x2 + 9a;' = 384. From 
which, x= zizl. Then y — 3x = 5 — 3 = 2, and y — x = 4, &c. 

The student will readily perceive the advantage of representing the 
first extreme by y — Sx, and the common difibrence by 2x.

INSERTION OF MEANS BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF A 
PROPORTION. 

436. The formula, d = -, enables us to insert any number of 

^ n — 1' •' 

means, when the extremes are known. Let it be required to insert 3 
means between 1 and 9. Then a := 1, and Z = 9, and, since 3 means 
are to be introduced between 1 and 9, n must be 5. Hence, d = 

9 1 

:= 2. Knowing the common difference, the terms succeeding 

the first can be readily formed. They are 3, 5, 7 ; and the 5 terms of 
the proportion are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

GENERAL EXAMPLES. 

1. Find 4 numbers in arithmetical progression, whose sum is 14, 
and the sum of whose squares is 54. Ans. 2, 3, 4, 5. 

Let y — 3a; = lesser extreme, and let 2x = common difference. 
Then the other terms are y — x, i/ + x and ^ + Sx. Hence, by the 
conditions, y — Bx + i/ — x -\- i/ + x + i/ + 3x^4y = 14, or y = 
3^. And (y — Sxy + (y — xf + (y + xY + (y + Sx)' = 4/ + 
20x2 ^ 54^ and eliminating f, we have 49 + 20a;' = 54, or x^ = I. 
Then, x = ± ^. From which the above series.

the sum of whose squares is 410. Ans. 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. 

Let y — 4a; = lesser extreme, and 2x = common difference. Then 
the terms will be represented by y — 4a:, y — 2a;, y, y + 2a;, y + 4a;.

4. The sum of 3 numbers in arithmetical progression is 18, and the 
sum of their squares 116. What are the numbers? Ans. 4, 6, 8. 

Let y represent the mean, and x the common difference, then will 
7/ — X, y andy+a;, represent the three terms of the progression. 

5. A and B are separated by a distance of 45 miles. A travels 
towards B at the rate of 1 mile the first hour, 2 miles the second hour, 
3 miles the third hour, &c. B travels towards A at the rate of 10 
miles the first hour, 8 miles the second hour, 6 miles the third hour, 
&c. When will they come together ? 

Ans. At the end of the fifth hour, and also at the end of the 
eighteenth hour. 

The second value needs explanation. The formula Z = a — {ix — l)c^. 
which gives the distance travelled by B during the Ji*" hour, shows that 
B does not travel at all the sixth hour. And since, when w ^ 6, I is 
negative, we conclude that B turns back, and travels in the contrary 
direction after the sixth hour. 

15 miles 

A P B M 



At the end of the fifth hour the two travellers were together at P, 
15 miles from A. In 13 more hours the traveller A will be 156 miles 
from P, at a point M. The traveller B rests during the sixth hour, and 
at the beginning of the seventh hour turns back in pursuit of A, and 
at the end of the eighteenth hour from the time of his first starting 
from B, he will also be at M, 156 miles from B. These results are 
easily deduced from the formulae. 

When the travellers come together at M, A will have travelled 17 
miles, and B 201 miles. 

The problem explains most satisfactorily the meaning of a negative 
solution, and shows that, when distance is the thing to be determined, 
the negative sign always implies a change of direction.

The progression begins with the second term. 



GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION. 

437. A Geometrical Progression is a series of terms, any one of 
which is formed from that which immediately precedes, by multiplying 
by a constant quantity. When the constant multiplier is greater than 



GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION. 423 

unity, the series is an increasing progression. Thus 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 
64, &c., constitute an increasing progression, the constant multiplier or 
ratio of the progression being 2. And 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, is a decreas- 
ing progression, with the ratio \. The ratio of a decreasing progression 
is always unity divided by an entire quantity. It is evident that an 
increasing progression taken in reverse order will be a decreasing pro- 
gression, and that the ratio of the latter progression will be the recipro- 
cal of the former. The converse of this is also plainly true. Thus 6, 

-, -^, -3, &c., is a decreasing progression whose ratio is -, a, being 

supposed an entire quantity, and -3, -^, -, and I, constitute an in- 
creasing progression, whose ratio is a. 

It is plain that a Geometrical Progression differs from a Geometrical 
Proportion only in its number of terms. 



FORMULA FOR THE Klh TERM. 

438. Let the first term be a, and r the ratio of the progression : then 
ar will be the second term, ar^ the third, ai^ the fourth, and so on. 
That is, each term is equal to the first term, multiplied by the ratio 
raised to a power denoted by the number of terms, which precede the 
required term. Hence, if I represent the «*■• term, we must have I ^ 
ar°-', that is, the n*" term is equal to the first term, multiplied hy the 
ratio raised to the (n — 1) power. I may represent the last term, in 
which case n — 1 will be the number of terms less one. The formula, 

I =z ar^^, will enable us to determine any term, when the number of 
preceding terms, the ratio and the first term are known. When n = 1, 
we have I =1 a ; when n ^ 2, I = ar, &c. When a = 0, I also =0; 
wh&a. r =z 0,1 also = ; when a^r,l = r". *

424 GEOMETEICAL PROGRESSION. 

The n}^ term being made up of a product and a power, is much 
greater in geometrical than in arithmetical progression, when r is ^ 1, 
and much less in the former than in the latter, when i'<^l. Thus, a 
corresponding example to 3, in arithmetical progression, with the first 
term 2 and common difference 4, would give 82 for the 21st term; 
and the answer to a corresponding problem to 4, in arithmetical pro- 
gression, would be 44. 



FORMULA FOR THE RATIO OF THE PROGRESSION. 



439. The equation, I = ar°~\ gives r = \ / — , 



that is, the ratio is 



equal to the (n — ly^ root of the quotient arising from dividing the to^^ 
term hy the \st term. 

This formula can be used when n, I, and a, are known. When I = a, 

we have r = 1 ; when n = 1, r = oo ; when n = 2, /• = — . 



EXAMPLES. 

1. The 3d term of a geometrical series is 256, and the first term 4. 
What is the ratio? Ans. r = 8. 

2. The fourth term of a geometrical series is 2401, and the first 
term 7. Required the ratio. Ans. r = 7. 

3. The first term of a geometrical series is 50, and the fourth term 
6250. Required the ratio. Ans. r = 5. 

4. The first term of a geometrical series is 6250, and the fourth 
term 50. Required the ratio. Ans. r = ^. 

5. The first term of a geometrical series is a, and the (m + 1)*'' 
term a^. Required the ratio. Ans. y/a. 



Corollary. 

440. The formula, r =z \ / — , enables us to insert any number of 

means between two extremes. If we wish to introduce m means be- 
tween a and I, then the total number of terms will be m -f 2. Hence, 



GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION. 425 



Thus, let it be 



»( + ! / / 
n — l=m + 2 — \=zm + 1, and r = Kj — . 

required to insert 3 means between 2 and 32 ; then, r = V 2* =^ \/16 
= 2. And the series is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Find three means between yW and 1728, and the ratio of the pro- 
gression, Ans. 1 . 12 . 144, and r =z 12. 



Ans. 40 and 4800. 



FORMULA FOR THE SUM OF THE TERMS. 

441. If we multiply a series of "terms in Geometrical Progression 
by the ratio, a new series will be produced, whose first term will be the 
same as the second of the old series, and whose other terms will all 
be the same as the corresponding terms of the original series, except 
its last term. It is plain, then, that if the old series be subtracted 
from the new, all the terms will be cancelled except the first of the old 
series and the last of the new. 

Take, for example, the series, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243. 

And multiply each term by the ratio, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729. 
Subtracting the first from the 3, 729. 

second series, we have left but two terms. 

Let S represent the sum of n terms in geometrical progression. 

Then, S = a -f ar + ar^ + ar^ or""'. 

Multiply by r, and we have Sr = ar + ar'^ + ar^ ar^~^ -f ar^. 

Hence, Sr — S =z ar^ — a, and S = — ^^ = — . 

r — 1 

That is, the sum of the terms is equal to the first term into the diffe- 
rence hctioeen unity and the ratio raised to a power denoted hy the 
number of terms, and this product divided hy the ratio, less 1. This 
formula can be used when the first term, the ratio, and number of 
terms are known, or can be determined. Since I = ar'''^ then, 

Ir z= ar^, and the formula may be written S =z ^ ; that is, the 



426 GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION. 

sum of the terms is equal to the last, or n"", term into the ratio, minus 
the first term, and this difference divided hij the ratio, less 1. 

When n = 0, the second members of the equations in S and Sr will 
cancel each other, and give S = Oj but when r = 1, the equation in 

S becomes S = na, whilst the formula, S = — ^ ~, becomes S = g. 

This is generally the symbol of indetermination, but, in the present in- 
stance, indicates a vanishing fraction. The common factor to the two 
terms of the fraction is plainly r — 1, because r — 1 is an exact divisor 

of the numerator. Performing the division, we have S = — — "~ ^ 

= a (r""' + r"-^ + r°~^ + r + 1). Now, making r = l, 

we have S = 7ia 

442. When the progression is decreasing, 8r is less than S ; hence, 
to find S, we must take Sr from S. Then, S — Sr = a — ar", or 

ft /I I 7'^'^ ft 1_ I ly* 

S = — !q = — = . that is, the sum of the terms of a de- 

1 — r 1 — r •' 

creasing progression is equal to the first term into unity, minus the last, 

or n"", ter7n into the ratio, and this difference, divided hy one, minus 

the ratio.

443. The two equations, I = ar''~\ and s = a =— , contain 

five quantities, any two of which can be determined when the other 
three are known. Thus, when a, I and n, are known, we obtain, by 

combining these equations, and eliminating r, — 



ive get a = -^ 



In like manner, by eliminating ?, we get a = - ^ ■ ; and, by eli- 
minating a, we find I = 



AN INFINITE DECREASING PROGRESSION. 

444. The formula for the sum of the terms of a decreasing progres- 
sion takes a remarkable form when the series is infinite. 

For, S = t; may be written, S = -z . 

1 — r '' 1 — r 1 — r 

Now, since r is a fraction whose numerator is unity, like the fraction 

r° . 
1, it is plain that, when «. = oo , r° will be zero. Hence, = will 

be zero, and that part of the formula may be neglected when the num- 
ber of the terms is infinite, and we may write S = z: ; that is, the 

1 — r 

sum of the terms of an infinite decreasing progression is equal to the 
first term divided bi/ unity, minus the ratio of progressions. 

This formula will give the limit of the series, that is, a value which 
the sum of the terms cannot exceed. Thus, the decimal -33333, &c., 
may approach infinitely near to -i, but can never exceed it.

INEQUALITIES. 431 



INEQUALITIES. 

445. An inequality is an expression to signify that two quantities are 
unequal to each other. Thus, A ^ B, is an inequality indicating that 
A is greater than B. For equalities, it matters not on which side of the 
sign of equality the two quantities are written. Thus, A = B may be 
written B = A. But, for inequalities, there can be plainly no trans- 
position of the two quantities without a corresponding inversion of the 
sign. In the expression, A ^ B, if A be changed to the second mem- 
ber, and B to the first, there must be an inversion of the sign. For, let 
m be the quantity which, added to B, makes it equal to A, then, A = 
B + m, or B + m = A. Then B <^ A. So, B and A have changed 
places, with a corresponding inversion of sign. 

Inequalities are used to determine the limits between which quantities 
are found, and are of frequent application in the higher mathematics. 
As a simple illustration, suppose we have the two inequalities, a; ^ 5, 
and X <^ 10. We see that x must be some number between 5 and 10, 
and these numbers are the Umifs to its values. When the enunciation 
of the problem restricts the solution to positive quantities, there are but 
two limits, the superior positive limit, and the inferior positive limit. 
So, if the solution be restricted to negative quantities, there are but two 
limits, the superior negative limit, and the inferior negative limit. lYi 
general, however, there are four limits, two superior and two inferior. 

Two inequalities are said to subsist in the same sense, when the 
greater quantity lies on the same side of the sign in both of them; and 
they subsist in a contrary sense, when the greater quantity in one ine- 
quality lies on a different side of the sign from that occupied by the 
greater quantity in the other inequality. 

Thus, 4^2, and 5^3, subsist in the same sense; so also, 2 <^ 4, 
and 3 <^ 5. But 4^2, and 3 <^ 5, subsist in a contrary sense. 

When two quantities are negative, that one is the least, algebraically, 
which contains the greatest number of units. Thus, — 15 <C — l^j ' 
-5>-7. 

446. There are ten important principles, belonging to the subject of 
inequalities, which require to be demonstrated. 

1. If the same quantity be added to, or subtracted from, the two mem- 
bers of an inequality, the resulting inequality will subsist in the same 
sense. 



432 INEQUALITIES. 

For, let A ^ B, and m the difference between A and B, then, A = 
B + m. Now, add or subtract the same quantity, c, from both members, 
and there results Adbc = B + m=bc. Hence, of course, A ± c ^ 
B ± c, and the inequality subsists in the same sense. 

This principle enables us to transpose terms from one member of the 
inequality to the other. Take, x -\- 2 ^ a ; add — 2 to both members, 
and there results x^ a — 2. So, transposition is effected in inequalities, 
as in equations, by a change of sign. 

2. If the two members of an inequality are multiplied by a positive 
quantity, the resulting inequality will subsist in the same sense. 

For, let A ^ B, and A = B + m. Multiply both members by c, 
and we get Ac = Be -f mc. Hence, Ac ^ Be. This principle serves 
to free the fractions, if any, of their denominators. 

Take -^ -r-'^l/. Clearing of fractions, there results 2x — a ^ 

A1j\ 

3. If both members of an inequality are divided by a positive quan- 
tity, the resulting inequality will subsist in the same sense. 

For, let A ]> B, and m the difference between A and B. Then A = 

B + m. Dividing both members by c, there results, — = 1 . 

Hence, — ■>■ — . 

The last principle serves to clear the unknown quantity of its coeffi- 
cient when positive. Take, 2a; ^ a + 4&^, then, x ^ — . 

Li 

The three foregoing principles serve to solve inequalities, when the 
coefficient of the unknown quantity can be made positive. 

4. If two inequalities, subsisting in the same sense, are added 
together, member by member, the resulting inequality will subsist in 
the same sense. 

For, let A > B, and C > D. Let m be the difference between A 
and B, and n the difference between C and D. Then, A = B + m, 
and C = I) -f n. Adding the two equations, member by member, 
there results A + C = B + D + m + «. Hence, A + C > B + D. 

5. If an inequality be multiplied by a negative quantity, the result- 
ing inequality will subsist in a contrary sense. 

For, let A ^ B, or A = B + m. Multiply both members by — c, 
and there results — Ac = — Be — w, or m — Ac = — Be. Hence, 



INEQU..LITIES. 433 

Ac being numerically greater than Be, we have, algebraically, — Ac <^ 
— Be. 

The foregoing principles enab'e us to eliminate between inequalities 
as between equalities, when we have two inequalities involving two un- 
known quantities whose signs are known, and that of one of them in 
one inequality contrary to that of the same unknown quantity in the 
other inequality. 

Take x + y > 12, 

Adding member by member we get x^ 10, and this substituted in 
the first equation, gives y > 2. Let x = 10 + m. Then, from the 
2d equation i/ <^2 + m. The value of i/ is then fixed between the 
limits of 2 and 2 + m. 

6. If two inequalities, subsisting in the same sen.-: •, are subtracted 
member by member, the resulting inequality may subsist in the same or 
a contrary sense. 

For, let A > B, and C > D. Then, A = B + w, and C = D + ». 
Subtracting member by member, there results A — C = B + m — 
(D + n); or. A — C = B — D + m — «. 

Now, if m ^ «, A — C will be equal to B — D increased by a posi- 
tive quantity, and, of course, will be greater than it. But, if 71 "^ m, 
A — C will not be equal to B — D, until it has been diminished by the 
diflference between n and m. 

In that case, A — C < B — D. 

Take, 8 > 4, m = 4, 

6 > 3, n = 3. 
8— 6>1. 

The resulting equality subsists in the same sense, since m > n. 

But, take 8 > 6, m = 2, 

6 > 1, n = 5. 

8 — 6 < 5. 

The resulting inequality subsists in a contrary sense, since n > m. 

8. If both members of an inequality are essentially positive, they 
may be squared without altering the sense of the inequality. 

For, let A > B, or A = B -f m, then A^ = B^ + 2Bm + m^. 
Hence, A^ > B^ 

37 2c 



434 INEQUALITIES. 

9. If the two members of an inequality have contrary signs, the re- 
sulting inequality, after squaring, may silhsist in the same or a contrary 



For, let A > — B, or A = — B + m. Then, A' = B^ — 2Bm + 
m^ If m^ > 2Bm, then, A^^B^; for, A'' is equal to B^, increased 
by the difference between m^ and 2Bm. But, if ni^ <^ 2B?k, then, A^ 
<^ B'^ by the difference between 2Bm and m^. 

Take, 3 > — 2 ; then, m =5, m^ = 25, and 2Bm = 20. 
Squaring, we have, 9 > 4, since m^ > 2Bm. 
But take, 3 > — 6 ; then m = 9, m^ = 81, and 2Bm = 108. 
Squaring, we get, 9 <C 36, an inverted sign, since m^ < 2Bm. 

When, therefore, the sign of either member is unknown, it is not 
permitted to square the inequality. 

10. When the two members of an inequality are divided by a nega- 
tive quantity, the resulting inequality will subsist in a contrary sense. 

For, let A ^ B, or A = B + m. Dividing both members by — c, 

there results = . Since is numerically greater 

c c c c 

than , it must be algebraically less. 

c 

For equations of high degrees there are generally four limits : a supe- 
rior positive and a superior negative limit, and an inferior positive and 
an inferior negative limit. But the conditions of the problem may re- 
strict the solutions to two limits, and even to one limit. 

A single equation of the first degree can have but one limit, this may 
be superior or inferior, positive or negative. Limits are determined by 
means of inequalities. 



EXAMPLES. 

1. The value of x in an equation is such that, twice the value in- 
creased by unity cannot be less than 7. What is the lower limit of 
the value ? We have, from the conditions, 2a; -f 1 ^ 7. Hence, a; ^ 3. 
The inferior positive limit is then 3, and any number above 3 may be 
the value required. 

2. The value of cc in a simple equation of the first degree is known 
to be such, that twice the value, plus unity, is greater than 7, and that 



INEQUALITIES. 435 

three times the value, diminished by 4, is less than 11. Between what 
limits does the value lie ? 

Ans. Superior positive limit, 5; inferior positive limit, 3. 

If the value be known to be a whole number, 4 must be that number. 

3. A person desirous of giving some cents to a certain number of 
beggars, found on examination that, to give them three cents apiece, 
would require more than double of what he had about him, and that, to 
give them 2 cents apiece, would require more than the difference be- 
tween all he had and 35 cents. How many beggars were there, and 
how many cents had the person ? 

From the conditions, 3a; ^ 2y, 
and, 2a; ^35 — y. 

Multiplying the second inequality by 2, and adding member by men 
ber, there results, 7x ^ 70, or a; ^ 10. This value substituted in 
the first inequality, gives y <C 15 + I"; ^ representing the excess of 
X over 10. The value of x, substituted in the second inequality, gives 
y > 35 — 20 — 2m; or y > 15 — 2m. Suppose m = J, then. 
y < 151, and 7/ > 14. 

4. A person desiring to give some money to 11 beggars, found that, 
to give them 3 cents apiece, would require more than twice as much 
money as he had about him, and that, to give them 2 cents apiece,

436 GENERAL THEORY OF E(^UATIONS, 



GENEKAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 

447. The general theory of equations has for its object, the investi- 
gation of properties common to equations of every degree and of every 
form. 

We will confine ourselves mainly to the examination of equations in- 
volving but one unknown quantity. 

Tke most general form of an equation of the m*'' degree with one 

unknown quantity, is »"• -f Px-"-' + Qx'"-^ + Rx"-'' -f Tie 

-f U = 0. 

The coefficient of the first term is plus unity, and the other coeffi- 
cients, positive or negative, entire or fractional, rational or irrational. 

A value has been defined to be that which, substituted for the un- 
known quantity, will make the two members equal to each other. Since, 
in the general equation of the m*'' degree, the second member is zero, a 
value substituted for x, must reduce the first member to zero also. 
Hence, in our discussion, we may define a value to be that which, sub- 
stituted for the unknown quantity in the equation, will reduce the first 
member to zero. 

GENEKAL PROPERTIES OF EQUATIONS. 
First Property. 

448. If any quantity, a, be a value of x in the equation, a;" + Pa;""' 
+ . . . Taj -f U = 0, the first member of this equation will be exactly 
divisible by a; — a. 

Fffr, let Q' be the quotient resulting from the division of the first 
member by a:; — a, and let R' be the remainder, if any, after division. 
We shall then have the identical equation, x"" -f Pa;""' -f Qx'"~^+ .... 
-f- Ta; -f U = Q' (a; — a) -f R'. But, for x = a, the first member is, 
by hypothesis, equal to zero, and the second member reduces to R'. 
Hence, we have = + R', and, therefore, R' = 0, and the division 
is exact. 

Second Property. 

449. If the first member of an equation, of the form of a:" + Px"^' 
+ Qx"-^ -t- . . . . Tx -f- U = 0, be divisible by x — a, then a will be 
a value in this e(juation. 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 437 

For, calling Q' the quotient, we will have x^ + Px""' -j- Qx""^ -f- 
. . . . Ta; + U = Q(x — a). Hence, then, Q'(.r — a) = 0. But, when 
the product of two factors is equal to zero, the equation can he satisfied 
by placing either factor equal to zero. We have then a right to place 
X — a = 0, from which there results x = a. Therefore, a is a value 
in the equation, Q'(aj — «) = 0, and, consequently, in the given 
equation. 

Corollary. 

1st. It follows that, in order to ascertain whether any polynomial is 
divisible by x — a, we have only to substitute a for x, wherever x 
occurs, and see whether the polynomial reduces to zero. 

2d. Hence, also, if a polynomial is divisible by x — a, a will be a 
value in the equation formed by placing the polynomial equal to zero. 

3d. We may also diminish the degree of an equation, when we know 
one or more of its values, by dividing its first member successively by 
the binomial factors corresponding to these values. The division by 
each binomial factor will reduce the degree of the equation by unity. 

4th. Numerical equations can frequently be solved by means of the 
first two properties. Literal equations can also be solved in the same 
way, but more rarely : we have only to ascertain what number or quan- 
tity will satisfy the equation ; then, by dividing out the binomial factor 
corresponding to this value, we will have a now equation of a degree 
lower by unity. A second value may be found frdm this equation, and 
the factor corresponding to it divided out. Thus, we may continue tho 
process until the given equation is reduced to one of the second degree, 
which can be solved by known rules. 

EXAMPLES. 

1. Solve the equation, x^ — Gx-^ + 11^ — 6 = 0. 

We see that a: = 1 will satisfy this equation. Hence, x — 1 is a 
divisor. Dividing by x — 1, we get a quotient, x^ — 5x -f 6 = 0, by 
solving which we get a; = 2 and 3. Hence, the three values are 1, 
2, and 3. 

2. Solve the equation, x* — bx^ -f 4 = 0. 

We find +1 to be a value, and, dividing by a; — 1, we get a new 
equation, x^ -f x^ — 4x — 4 =, which is satisfied for x = — 1. 
Dividing by a; + 1, we get a new equation, x^ — 4 = 0, which gives 
37*

the two values, x= -\- 2, and — 2. The four values are then, + 1, 
— 1, H- 2, and — 2. 

3. Solve the equation, x^ + Sx* — 5x' + 4cc + 12 — ISa;^ = 0. 

Ans. + 1, — 1, + 2, — 2, and — 3. 

4. Solve the equation, x* — a^x^ — l^x^ + a^h'^ = 0. 

A71S. + a, — a, -f 5, — h. 

5. Solve the equation, of — a^x'^ — I'^x^ + a^x^ + I'^x^ — x'^ + a^¥x — 
aW = 0. Ans. + a, — a, + b, — b, and + 1. 

6. Solve the equation, sc^ + x^ — 4x — 4 = 0. 

Ans. + 2, —2, —1. 



Third Property. 

449. Every equation, with one unknown quantity, has as many 
values for this unknown quantity as is denoted by the degree of the 
equation, and has no more. 

Let us assume the equation, a:;" + Pa;"""' + Qx""^ + . . . Ta; + U 
= 0, which is of the m*'' degree. It is to be shown that it has m 
values and no more. We will also assume that every equation has at 
least one value. Let a be one value, then x — a is a divisor. Let 

jpm-i _j_ p'-^m-z _f. Q'a;"-' + T'ic + U', represent the quotient of 

the division of the first member by cc — a. Then the given equation 
will assume the form, {x — a) (x"-' + P'x"""^ -f Q'x"""^ + &c.) = 
. (A), in which, the coefficients, P', Q', are different from the 
original coefficients, P, Q, &c. Now, since, in equation (A), we have the 
product of two factors equal to zero, we have a right to place either 
equal to zero, let us place a;-""' + Fx"-^' + Q'cc"-^ + &c. = (B). 
Equation (B) will also have one value ; suppose it negative and equal to 
— h. Then, by the first property, x — ( — Z)) = x ^- & will be a 
divisor. The first member of (B) can then be decomposled into two 
factors, one of which will be a; + &, and the other the quotient arising 
from the division of the first member by a; + &• Hence, (B) becomes 
(a; + h) (a;'"-^ + F'a;'"-^ + g'tt""-" + &c.) = (C). And (A) can be 
put under the form of {x — a) (x + I) (x'"-^ + T"x^-^ + Q"x"'-^ + 
&c) =0. It is plain that, by putting the second factor of (C) equal to 
zero, we will get another value, and, consequently, another divisor. By 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 439 

continuing this process, the degree of a; in the successive quotients will 
be diminished by unity each time, and, after m — 1 divisions, we will 
obtain a quotient of the first degree in x, from which, of course, one 
value of X will be found. "We supposed the first value positive, and 
the second negative, let us attribute the double sign, ± , to the remain- 
ing values, c, d, e, &c., since they may be either positive or negative. 
The first member of the given equation can then be decomposed into m 
binomial factors of the first degree in x, and we will have, a;" + Px"-' 

+ Qx'"-' + +Tx + V= (X — a) (x + b) (xzpc-) (x^zd) 

&c. = 0. 

But, since each factor corresponds to a value, and since there are m 
divisors, or factors, there must be ?n. values. 



Scholium. 

1st. Had we known that the first member of an equation of the wi*"" 
degree could be decomposed into m binomial factors of the first degree 
with respect to x, we could readily have shown that the equation must 
contain ??i values. For, it can be satisfied in m ways, by placing each 
of its 7)1 factors equal to zero, and each factor, so placed, will give a 
value. Moreover, since the equation can be satisfied only in m ways, 
it contains no more than m values. 

2d, It does not follow that all the values must be difi"erent. Any 
number of them, even all of them, may be equal. Thus, the equation, 
a? — 2a; + 1 = 0, contains two values, each equal to + 1. The equa- 
tion, (x — a)"" = 0, contains m values, each equal to -j- a The equa- 
tion, (x — a)'°(x-{-by=0, contains m values, each equal to + a, and n 
values, each equal to — b. And so for other equations. 

3d. An equation of the third degree, such as (x — a) (x — b) (x — c) 
= 0, will contain three divisors of the first degree, {x — a), (x — b), 
and (a; — c) ; three of the second degree, (a; — a) (x — &), (x — a) 
(x — c), and (x — h) (x — c) ; and one of the third, (x — a) (x — b) 
(x — c). These divisors are evidently equal to the number of combi- 
nations which can be formed by combining 3 letters in sets of 1 and 1, 
2 and 2, 3 and 3. So, likewise, if we take the m factors of an equation 
and multiply them two and two, three and three, &c., we shall evidently 
obtain as many divisors of the second degree as we can form combina- 
tions of VI letters, taken two and two ; and as many divisors of the third 
degree as there are combinations of ??i letters taken three and three. 



440 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 



&c. The given equation will then have m divisors of the first degree, 

m(m — 1) m(m — 1) (m — 2) 
in X, ■ — — - — divisors oi the second degree, — ^= ^ — ^-^ 

of the third degree, &c. 



Fourth Property. 

451. All the coefficients, after the first, of an equation of the m*'' 
degree, are functions of the values. 

Suppose the general equation of the ?n*'' degree, a;" + Pa:;"'-' -f 
Qaj"'-^ + .,..+ Tec + U = 0, contains the m values, ± a, d= 6, ± c, 
± c7, &c. The equation can then be put under the form of (x rp a) 
(x =F 6) (x =F c) (x =fi d), &c., to m factors = 0. By actually per- 
forming the indicated multiplication, we will get.

The upper row of signs belonging to the positive value, and the 
lower to the negative. 

We observe the following relation between the coefficients and the 
values : 

1. The coefficient of the second term is the sum of all the values of 
the unknown quantity, with their signs changed. 

2. The coefficient of the third term is the sum of the products of all 
the values, taken two and two, with their respective signs. 

3. The coefficient of the fourth term is the sum of the products of all 
the values, taken three and three, with their signs changed. 

4. The last term is the continued product of all the values of the 
unknown quantity, with their respective signs if the degree of the 
equation be even, or with their signs changed if it be odd. 

We have supposed in the preceding demonstration that all the values 
were positive or all negative. But the law of formation for the coeffi- 
cients is evidently the same when some of the values are positive and 
some nejrative. 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 441 

Thus, let tte values be + a, + h, and — c. 



Then, (x — a) (x — h) (x4-c)=0, orx^ — a \x^-\-a'b 

— 5 — ac 

+ c\ — he 



X + ahc = 0. 



And we see that coefficients are formed in accordance with the above 



452. The preceding properties show several important things in 
relation to the composition of an equation. 

1. If the coefficient of the second term of an equation be zero, and, 
consequently, the second term be wanting, the sum of the positive 
values must be equal to the sum of the negative values. 

2. If the signs of the terms of an equation be all positive, the values 
must be all negative. For, an equation cannot have all its terms posi- 
tive unless its binomial factors are of the form, (x + a) (x + h) {x + c), 
&c. ; which factors, placed equal to zero, will give the negative values, 
— a, — h, — c, &c. 

3. If the signs of the terms of an equation be alternately + and — , 
the values of the unknown quantity will be all positive. For, in this 
case, the first member of the equation must be made up of the factors, 
(x — a) (x — U) (x — c), &c., corresponding to positive values. 

4. Since the last term, irrespective of its sign, is the continued pro- 
duct of the values, it follows that, when the last term is zero, one value, 
at least, must be zero. 

5. It follows, also, from the composition of the last term, that, in 
seeking for a value, we need only seek among the divisors of the last 
term, since every value must be a divisor of that term. 

6. If we know one value, the coefficient of the second term will give 
the sum of all the rest, and the last term, divided by this value, with or 
without its sign changed, will give the product of all the rest. 



Corollary. 

453. 1st. The last two consequences enable us to solve equations 
with facility when all the values except two are known. 

Take, as an example, the equation, x^ — Ix'^ — |x + | = 0. 

The values must be sought among the divisors of the last term : 
+ 1 is a divisor of the last term, and may, therefore, be a value ; upon 



442 GENERAL THEORY OP EQUATIONS. 

trial, we find that it will satisfy the equation, and is, therefore, a value. 
Calling the other two values x and y, we will have, — (1 -\- x -}- 1/) = 

— I, the coefficient of the second term. Hence, x + y = — ^. We 

xy 
have, also (sixth consequence), -f = — i- Combining these two 

equations, we get x ( — i — a;) = — ^, or cc^ + |x = + |. And 
the values of x and ^ are found to be + ^, and — 1. The equation 
has, of course, but three values, since it is an equation of the third 
degree, (Art. 450). 

2d. When all the values are known except two, we can tell whether 
these values are real or imaginary without actually finding them. 

Thus, take the equation, x* — 6x^ — IQx + 21 = 0. 

The exact divisors of the last term are +1, +3, and +7, — 1, 

— 3, and — 7 ; the values must be sought among these numbers. 
We find, upon trial, that + 1 and + 3 are values. The second term 
of the equation being wanting, the sum of the other two values must 

21 

be — 4, and their product :j — - = 7. But 4 is the greatest product 

which can be given by two numbers whose sum is 4. Hence, the 
other two values of the equation are imaginary. And, in fact, by pur- 
suing the preceding process, we find them to be — 2 -\-y/ — 3, and 

_ 2— ^ITS-

3. Solve the equation, x* — 2x' — S = 0. 

Ans. + 2, — 2, + ^/■=^, —^':^^. 

454. 3d. If the values are known, the equations which give those 
values can be formed in two ways, either by multiplying together the 
binomial factors corresponding to those values (Art. 450), or by form- 
ing the coefficients, (Art. 451). 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 443 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Form tte equation whose values are + 1, — 1 and — 2. 

Ans. x'' + 2x^ — x — 2 = 0. 

For the factors, multiplied together, and placed equal to zero, give 
(x — 1) (x + 1) (a; + 2) = (A) ov x'' + 2x'' — x — 2 =^ 0. 

We see that the three factors of (A), placed separately equal to zero, 
will give the values, + 1, — 1, and — 2, or the problem may be solved 
by Art. 450.

4. Form, by both methods, the equation whose values are — 1, — 2, 
— 3, and — 4. Ans. x* + lOx'' + 35x2 + 50x + 24 = 0. 

Fifth Property. 

455. Every equation may be transformed into another, in which the 
values of the unknown quantity shall be equal to those of the proposed 
equation, increased or diminished by a certain quantity. 

Let the given equation be 

' x" + Px»-' + Qx"' + + Tx + U = 0, 

and let it be proposed to transform it into another in y, so that y = 
x± a. The principle of transformation is, of course, the same when 
y = x + o, or = x — a ; we will then confine our discussion to the 
case, when y =■ x — a. From this equation there results, x — y + <^- 
Substituting this value in the proposed equation, it becomes {jy + a)"* 

+ P (^ + a)-' + Q(y + ay-^ + T (// + a) + U = 0. 

Developing the different powers of y + a by the binomial fonnula, and 
arranging the development according to the descending powers of y, we 
have the transformed equation,

If the values of y in this equation can be found, the corresponding 
values of x in the given equation will be equal to these values in- 
creased by a. 



Corollary. 

456. The preceding transformation enables us to reduce the number 
of terms in an equation. For, since the quantity, a, is entirely arbi- 
trary, such a value may be given to it as will reduce the coefficient of 
any term in the transformed equation to zero, and consequently make 
the term itself disappear. Suppose we wish to free the transformed 
equation of its second term; we have only to place the coefficient of that 
term equal to zero, and find the value of the quantity, a, that makes it 
zero. Of course, then, this value attributed to a, will cause the dis- 
appearance of the second term of the equation. Placing ma -f P = 0, 

P P 

we get a = . Then, x i= y . Hence, for transforming one 

equation into another, in which the second term is wanting, the following 



RULE. 

Substitute for the unknown quantity a new unknown quantity, con- 
nected with the quotient arising from dividing the coeffi/^ient of the 
second term of the given equation, with its sign changed hy the degree 
of the equation. 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Transform the equation, x^ — ^x = 5, into another, in which the 
second term shall be wanting. Ans. x = y — ( — |) = y + 2. 

The transformed equation will then be {y -\-Tf — 4 (y -f 2) = 5, or 
y — 4 = 5. Hence, y'^ = 9, and y = =1= 3 ; and, cc = y -j- 2 = 5, 
or — 1 ; the same result that we would obtain by solving the given 
equation. 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 445 

2. Transform the equation, x^ — Zx^ = — 2, into another, in •which 
the second term shall be wanting. Ans. y^ — 3y = 0. 

The transformed equation can be readily solved, one value of y being 
zero. Hence, one value of the given equation is 1. The transformed 
equation, in this case and in many others, is simpler than the given 
equation, and, therefore, more readily solved. The chief object of the 
transformation is to simplify the form of the equation. 



Scholium. 

457. 1. The third term of the transformed equation may be made to 
disappear by giving to a such a value as will satisfy the equation, 

— ~ ~ — + (m — 1) Pa + Q = 0. And, since this equation 

is of the second degree in a, there are two values for a, and, con- 
sequently, the third term can be made to disappear in two ways. In 
like manner, the fourth term can be made to disappear in three ways, 
the fifth term in four ways, &c. j and the last, or {in + l)**" term, in m 
ways. By recurrence to the derivations of these coefficients from the 
values, we see that the above results are true. The last term, for in- 
stance, being made up of the product of the m values, can be made to 
disappear by placing either of the m values equal to zero. 

458. 2. It may happen that the value of a, which makes the second 
term disappear, will also cause the disappearance of the third or some 
other term at the same time. Let us examine under what circumstan- 
ces the second and third terms will disappear together. By placing the 
coefficient of the second term, Pa + m, equal to zero, we get a = 

, and, by placing that of the third term, ^ — ^;~— -f (m — 1) 

P^ /P 2Q 



P /P^ 

Pa + Q, also equal to zero, we get « ^ d= \ / — 

m \ m m(vi — 1) 

Now, it is plain that the values of a in this equation will be identical 
P 
with the last, that is, both , when the radical disappears. Placing 

2mQ 

the radical equal to zero, we get P^ ^ — -. "Whenever, then, the 

m — 1 

square of the coefficient of the second term is equal to twice the quo- 
tient arising from dividing the product of the desree of the equation

446 GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 

into tte coefficient of the third term by the degree of the equation, 
less one, the second and third terms will disappear together. 

The same truth may be demonstrated more elegantly by the principle 
of the greatest common divisor. 

Dividing the coefficient of the third term by that of the second, we 

get, after two divisions, a remainder, mQ + ^^ ^ • And, it is evi- 
dent that, when this remainder is placed equal to zero, we will have 
made manifest the circumstances under which there will be a common 
factor between the two coefficients. Placing the remainder equal to 



zero, we get P'^ = zr, as before

2. Find two values in the equation, x* -f 4a;' -f 6x^ -\-4x — 15 = 0. 
Ans. Transformed equation, i/* — 16 = 0, then, y = ± 2, and x = 

+ 1, or — 3. 

Sixth Property. 

459. Every equation having the coefficient of the first term plus 
unity, and the other coefficients entire, will have entire numbers only 
for its rational values. 

Let the proposed equation be 

^m + p^m-1 _|_ Qa.m-2 + Tx + U = 0. 

In which, P, Q, &c., are whole numbers. 

If X can have a fractional value in this equation, let this value, re- 
duced to its lowest terms, be — . Substituting this value for x in the 
given equation, it becomes 

Multiplying by h^~\ and transposing, we get 

^ = — Pa"-' — Qa^-^i — TaS^-^ — U6"-». 





GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 447 

But tlie second member is an entire quantity, since all its terms are 
entire. Hence, the first member must be entire. But, since a, by 
hypothesis, is prime with respect to &, a" must also be prime with re- 
spect to b. The supposition of the proposed equation containing a ra- 
tional fractional value, has then resulted in the absurdity of making an 
entire quantity equal to an irreducible fraction. "We conclude, there- 
fore, that this supposition is wrong, and that the rational values are all 
entire. The demonstration is restricted to rational values, because the 

assumed value, -^, is rational in its form. 



CoroEari/. 

460. Articles 452, 456 and 459, are used in solving numerical and 
literal equations by changing their forms. 

Let the proposed equation be y* — -ii/^ — 8?/ + 32 = 0. "We know 
that all the rational values are entire (Art. 459), and that they must be 
found among the divisors of the last term (Art. 452). But as there 
are so many divisors of the last term, it will be more convenient to 
employ (Art. 456) to transform the equation into another, whose last 

term admits of fewer divisors. Make re =y — (—j-\ = i/-\-l. The 

transformed equation in x, is x* — 6.7=^ — IGx + 21 := 0, and the 
divisors of the last term, are -}- 1, + 3, + 7, + 21, and — 1, — 3, 
— 7, — 21. On trial of these divisors, wc find that -f 1 and + 3, 
will satisfy the transformed equation, and, consequently, are values. 
Hence, cc = 2/ + 1 = 2 and 4, in the given equation. Dividing the 
first member of the given equation by (x — 2) (Art. 449), it will be

461. Imaginary values enter equations hi/ pairs. 

We are to show that if a-\-hy/ — 1 is a value in the equation, x" -f 

Pa;"-' + Qx'"-^ + Tx + U = 0, a — h^'^^ will also be a 

value. 

The truth of the proposition is an evident consequence of Art. 451, 
for U, the last term, is the product of all the values, and it has been 
assumed real. But it can only be real, when the imaginary values (if 



448 GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS, 

any), enter by pairs, and of such a form as to give a real product when 
multiplied together. Thus, if we have two imaginary values, m + 
v/ — n and ^ — 4, we must also have two other values, m — ^ — n 
and — v/ — 4, otherwise, U will not be real. Or, we may demonstrate 
the property otherwise, thus : by substituting the assumed value, 
a + h^ — 1, in the given equation, we will have, (a -f l-y — 1)" + P 

(a + i^/— I)"-' + T (a + hs/^^) + U = 0. When 

these terms are expanded, the odd powers of t v' — 1 will be imaginary, 
and the even, real. Representing by A all the real terms involving a 
or h, and by B^-^ 1 aU the imaginary terms, we will have A + 
B v' — 1 = 0. Now, since a + h^ — 1 is, by hypothesis, a value, the 
last equation must be satisfied, but this can only be so when A = 0, and 
Bv/ — 1 = 0, since imaginary terms cannot be cancelled by real ones. 
If « — h^ — 1 be substituted in the equation, the expanded results 
will be precisely the same, except that the odd powers of hy/ — 1 will 
be negative. Hence, we will have A — Bv^ — 1 = 0. But in order 
that a -f h^ — 1 should be a value, we have seen that A = and 
B = 0. Hence, the equation, A — B v' — 1 =; 0, is satisfied, and that 
being so, a — h-y — 1 must be a value. 

The absurdity of the hypothesis of a single imaginary value may be 
illustrated by an example. 

Let us assume that the three values of an equation of the third 
degree are + a, +1, and + v/ — 1. The equation must then be 
(x — a)Xx — 1) (x — vA=n:) = 0, or (x — a) (x" — (1 — v/=l) 
35 + >/ — 1) = 0. Hence, a? — a = 0, andcc'' — (l + \/ — V)x-\-y/ — 1

And we se e that we do not get back again the two values, + 1, and

Remarks. 

462. 1. The product of imaginary values is always positive, and, 
therefore, the absolute term of an equation, whose values are all imao-i- 
nary, must be positive. 

2. If the second term of an equation containing only imao-inary 
values, is wanting, these values will all be of the form, ±v'— ^• 

3. Every equation of an odd degree has at least one .real value forr,

and the sign of this value will be contrary to that of the last term of 
the equation. 

4. Every equation of an even degree, whose last term is negative, 
has at least two real values for x ; one positive, and one negative.

2. Two of the values of an equation of the fourth degree are + a,

Ans. Real. 

Eighth Property. 

463. If the real values of an equation, taken in the order of their 
magnitudes, be n, h, c, d and e ; a being ^6, h'^ c, &c. ; then, if a 
series of quantities, a', h', c', d', &c. ; a' taken greater than a, V be- 
tween a and h, c' between h and c ; be substituted for x in the pro- 
posed equation, the results will be alternately positive and negative. 

For, since a, &, c, d, &c., are assumed to be values, the proposed 
equation can be put under the form of (x — a) (x — h) (x — c) (x — d) 
&c. = 0. 

Substituting, for x, the proposed series of quantities, a', h', d, d', &c., 
we get the following results. 

(of — a) (a' — b) (a' — c) (a' — d) &c, = -{- result, since all the 
factors are positive. 

(6' — a) (b' — I) (V — r) (U — d) kc, = — result, since first factor 
only is negative. 

(c' — a) (d — h) (d — c) (c' — d) &,c., = + result, since first two 
factors only are negative. 

(df — a) ((Z' — 5) (d' — c) (d' — d) &c., = — result, since first 
three factors only are negative 

Remarks. 

1. We see that, between the quantities, a' and h', which give the first 
plus result and the first minus result, there is one value, a. And be- 
tween the quantities, a' and d', which give the first plus result and the 
second minus result, there are three values, a, h and c. And, as the 
38* 2d 



450 GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 

same is evidently true for any number of odd values, we conclude that, 
if two quantities be successively substituted for x in an equation, and 
give results, with different signs, between these quantities, there will 
be one, three, five, or some odd numbers of real value. 

2. If any quantity, m, and every quantity greater than m, give re- 
sults all positive, then m is greater than the greatest value of x in the 
equation. 

3. If the results obtained by substituting two quantities have the 
same sign, then, between these quantities there are two, four, six, or 
some even number of values, or no value at all. Thus, between a' and 
c', which give + results, there are two values, a and h. 

Scliolium. 

464. The preceding property may be demonstrated differently, by 
employing a principle of frequent application in all branches of mathe- 
matics, viz., that a quantity changes its sign in passing through zero 
and infinity. Let the quantity be x = a ; suppose x ^ a, the expres- 
sion is positive ; it is zero when x = a, and negative when x<^a. 
Hence, the quantity x — «, changes its sign in passing through zero. 

+ M 
Again, take , This quantity is positive when x'^a ; it is in- 
finite when X = a ; and negative when x <^a. Now, in the results 
of Art. 463, between the first + result and the first — result, the first 
member of the proposed equation must have passed through zero, and 
consequently through a value. In like manner, between the first 
— result, and the second + result, the first member must again have 
passed through zero, and consequently through a second value. Then 
two values must have been passed through between the first two + re- 
sults, &c. By continuing the same course of reasoning, we might 
readily show that three values must be passed through between the first 
positive and second negative result; five values between the first posi- 
tive and third negative result; two values between the first two negative 
results; four between the first and third negative results, &c., &c., 

Limit of the Values. — Ninth Property. 

465. If we substitute for the unknown quantity the greatest coeffi- 
cient plus unity, the first term of the equation will be greater than the 
sum of all the other terms, provided we always affect the greatest co- 
efficient with the positive sign.

Let us resume the equation, 

x^ + Prr-"-' + Qx"-^ + Ta; + U = 0. 

It is plain that the most unfavourable case will be when all the co- 
efficients have the same sign, -f or — . We will assume all the coeffi- 
cients after the first to be negative ; the given equation will then be of 

the form, x'^ — Tx^-' — Px"-^ — ¥x'^-^— P:c»-^ — P = 0,

Disregarding the sign of P for a moment, we wish to ascertain what 
value X must have, in order that cc" ^ P(x°~' -f- cc"^^ + a;"~* . . . -f x 
+ 1). Inverting the order of the terms within the parenthesis, we 
will have a geometrical progression, whereof, 1 is the first term, x°^' 
the last term, and x the ratio of the progression. The formula, S' =

In seeking for the positive values of an equation, we need not go 
beyond the greatest coefficient with a positive sign prefixed to it, plus 
unity. Thus, in example first, there is no positive value greater than 
8, because 8, and all numbers greater than 8, will continually make the 
first member positive (Art. 463).

Second Limit. — Tenth Property. 

466. If we substitute for x in the equation, x" + Pa:"-' + Qx"-^ 
. . . , Ta; + U = 0, unity, increased by that root of the greatest nega- 
tive coefficient which is indicated by the number of terms preceding 
the first negative term, we will have a superior limit of the positive 
values. 

Suppose Nx"""" to be the first negative term, and suppose W to be 
the greatest negative coefficient. The most unfavourable case obviously 
is that in which we suppose all the coefficients after N, negative, and 
equal to W. It is plain, moreover, that any value of x which makes 

a." ^ W(x'"-° + x"-"-' + «+!), will, of course, make the 

first member of the given equation positive. We are to find the value 
which fulfils this condition. 

Resuming the inequality, x" ^ W(a;"-° + a"-"-' + ic""-""^ ....

From which, x — 1 = —^^ , or (x — l)x"~' = W. Now, if (x — 1) 

(x — 1)°-' = W, then {x — l)x"-' will be greater than W. If, how- 
ever, we place it equal to W, we will have (a; — 1) (x — 1)"-' = W, 
or (x — 1)° = W. Hence, x = 1 + y W, which agrees vsdth the 
enunciation. 

It will be seen that in two respects we have taken an unfavorable 
case. The second limit t en may considerably exceed the greatest 
positive value, but it is smaller than the first limit, and, therefore, the 
most used in practice.

Eleventh Property. 

467. The equation, x"" + Pa;'"-'+ Qa;'"-^ + + Ta; + U = 0, 

can be transformed into another in y, or some other variable, such, that 
the values of the new unknown quantity shall be some multiple of 
those of the old unknown quantity. 

For, let y = nx, then x = —. Substituting for x, wherever it occurs 
'in the given equation, its value in terras of y, we have -- + P ^^ri + 
Q^V....T^^+ U = 0, or y- + 7iFy-i + n'Qy-' 



w^-'Ty + n"!! = 0. And we sec that the transformation is effected 
by changing x into y, multiplying the coefficient of the second term by 
the multiple n, that of the third term by n^, &c. For instance, let it 
be required to transform the equation, x* + 2x' + 4x^ + 8ar -f- 1 = 0, 
into another, in which the values of the new unknown quantity shall 
be twice as great as those of the old. Then y ^ 2x, and we have y* 
+ 4/+16/+64y + 16 = 0. 

RemarJcs. 

The principal use of this transformation is in clearing an equation 
of fractional coefficients, and at the same time making the new equa- 
tion preserve the proposed form ; that is, the coefficient of the first term 

Pa;""' 
is still to be plus unity. Let us take the equation, as™ -\ 1- 

Qx"-' . Kx"-' Tx U ^ . , . , 

— ■ H ^ 0, in which we assume mn to be 

n mn n n 

the least common multiple of the denominators. Then y = mnx. 
The transformed equation will then be ^-^^ — I h^— — ;-! ~ 5 

T» m-3 Tl TT 

m^b^Ry'"-^ .... m"-'w"'-'^Ty + m^Ti^-'U = 0. And we see that the 
transformation is effected by changing x into y, and multiplying the 
second term by the first power of the least common multiple, the third 
term by the second power of that multiple, &c. Thus, the transformed 

equation of x^ + |- — | + 1 = 0, is y' + 4/ — 36y + 1728 = 0. 



454 GENERAL THEORY OE EQUATIONS. 

468. The two rules just given are, of course, only applicable when 
the coefficient of the highest power of x is plus unity. When that is 
not the case, we may either first make this coefficient plus unity, and 
apply one of the preceding rules, or we may at once make y = nx, n 
in this case representing the product of the least common multiple of 
the denominators by the coefficient of the highest power of x. 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Transform the equation, x^ — 4x' + 2x -f 2 = 0, into another, 
in which the values shall be twice as great as in the given equation. 

Ans. y — Stf + 8y + 16 = 0.

4. Transform the equation, 2x^ — "5"+ p + 1 = 0, into another,

o o 

whose coefficients shall all be entire, and the coefficient of the first 
term, plus unity. Ans. / — 2/ + 12y + 864 = 0. 

In this, make y = 12a:;. 

469. When the coefficient of the first term is some whole number 
different from unity, and the other coefficients are entire, make n, in 
the equation y = nx, equal to the coefficient of the first term. Thus, to 
transform the equation, Qx^ — 19^;^+ 19x — 6 = 0, make y = Qx, 
the transformed equation will be / — 19/ + 114y — 216 = 0. 

Twelfth Properti/. — Process of Divisors. 

470, In every equation in which the coefficient of the first term is 
unity, and all the other coefficients are entire, a value will divide the 
last term, the sum arising from adding the quotient so obtained to the 



GENERAL TS'EORY OF EQUATIONS. 455 

coefficient of the second term from the right, the sum arising from 
adding this second quotient to the coefficient of the third term from the 
right, and will thus continue to be an exact divisor of all the successive 
sums so formed, until the coefficient of the second term from the left 
has been added to the previous quotient, when the last quotient will be 
minus unity. 

Let us resume the equation, 

x^ + Px"-' + Qx"'-^ + Ta; + U = 0, 

in which all the coefficients are entire. Suppose a to be a value, the 
equation will then become, after transposition and division by «, a"~' 

+ Pa""-^ + Qa°~^ T = . Now, since the first member is 

made up of entire terms, the second member must be entire also. 
Hence, U is divisible by a, as it ought to be, since U is the product of 
all the values. Transposing T to the second member, we have a"—' + 

P(j°'-2 ^ Qa'o-s + &c. = — T = U'; U' representing the alge- 
braic sum of T and — . 
a 

Dividing both members again by a, we get the equation, a""" + 

Pa"-' + Qa"-^ + &c. = . 

a 

The first member being entire, the second member must be entire 
also. Hence, the second condition to be fulfilled by a value is, that it 
must be an exact divisor of the sum formed by adding the quotient of 
the last term by the value to the coefficient of the first power of x. 
This was also to have been anticipated, because the coefficient of the 
first power of x is made up of the values, taken m — 1 and m -^ 1 ; 
one of these combinations will not contain the value a, and will have a 
sign contrary to the first quotient, and will be cancelled by it. The re- 
maining terms making up this coefficient all contain a, hence, a will be 
a divisor. By transposing the terms in succession, and continuing the 

. . . P' 

division, we will find, after m transpositions and divisions, — = — 1 ; 

P' representing the sum of the coefficients of x""-' added to the pre- 
ceding quotient. 

Hence, the last condition to be fulfilled by a value is, that it must be 
an exact divisor of the sum formed by adding the coefficient of x"-' to 
the preceding quotient. 



456 GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 

We, therefore, have the following rule for finding the rational values 
of an equation. 

RULE. 

I. Transform the equation, if necessary, into another, in lohich all 
the coefjicients shall he entire; that of the first term heing plus unity. 
All the rational values will then he entire (Art. 459). 

II. Find the superior positive and superior negative limits of the 
values. 

III. Write down in succession, in the same horizontal line, all the 
entire divisors of the last term hetween zero and these limits. 

IV. Divide the last term hy each of these divisors, and write the re- 
spective quotients hcneath the corresjyonding divisors. 

V. Add the coefiicient of the first power of x to each of these quo- 
tients, and tvrite each sum thus formed heneath the corresponding 
quotient. 

VI. Divide these sums hy the corresponding divisors in the column 
of divisors, and write the new quotients under the corresponding sums, 
rejecting those divisors lohich give fractional quotients, and crossing out 
the vertical column in which they occur. 

VII. Proceed in this way until the coefficient of x""' has heen added, 
to the preceding quotient, then those divisors that give minus unity for 
quotients, are values, and they are the only rational values. 

EXAMPLES. 

a;3 _ 2a;2 — 5x + 6 = 0. 

The superior positive limit is 1 +^5 = 6. 

The superior negative limit is found by changing + x into — x; the 
superior positive limit of the transformed equation will then be the 
superior negative limit of the given equation. 

Changing + x into — x, we get — x^ — 2x^ -f- 5a; + 6 = 0. But 
the coefficient of the first term must always be plus unity, hence, by 
multiplying the equation by minus unity we have, x^ + 2x^ — bx — 
6 = 0. _ 

Then — (1 + v'e) = superior negative limit. Assume — 4 to be 
this limit, the square root of 6 being between 2 and 3, we take 3 to be 
the root, since it is better to have the hmit too great than too small. 
Hence, we have these divisors below the limits, +1, + 2, + 3 ; — 1, 
-2,-3.

Hence, we have + 1 , + 3, and — 2, for the three values of the

Let us take, as a second example, the equation, x* — 2x^ — 8 = 0.

Hence, + 2 and — 2 are values in the given equation. And by 
dividing the first member of the given equation by the factors (x — 2) 
and (x + 2) corresponding to these values, we obtain the quotient, 
x^ + 2. By placing this quotient equal to zero, the remaining two 
values of the equation will be found to be + ^Z — 2, and — ^ — 2. 

471. The process of divisors is applicable to literal, as well as nu- 
merical equations, when all the coefficients are entire. A literal equa- 
tion, too, will best show why it is that the successive sums are divisible 
by the values. 

Take, as an example, 

x^ — (a +6 + c)x'^ + (o6 + ac+ hc^x — ahc = 0. 

Since the terms are alternately plus and minus, the values must all 
be positive.

472. The process of divisors enables us to find all the rational values 
of any equation. We have only to make all the coefl&cients entire, if 
not already so, that of the highest power of x being made plus unity. 
All the rational values of y in the transformed equation will be entire ; 
find these values, and then those of x will be known from the relation 
between x and y. 

Take 6x' — Idx^ + 19x — G = 0. Making ^ = Qx, we have the 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 459 

transformed equation in y, ^ — 19j/^ + 114y — 216 = 0. By pi*o- 
ceeding as before, we find the three values of y to be + 9, + 6, and 
+ 4. Hence, the corresponding values of a; are | + 1 and + |. 

473. In this, and in many examples, the last term has a great num- 
ber of exact divisors, and the process is therefore tedious. It is often 
convenient to transform an equation, whose last term is too large, into 
another whose values shall be greater or smaller by a constant quantity. 
Making y = z + 2, in the preceding equation, the transformed equa- 
tion in z '\^ ^ — 132r^ + 50z — 56 = ; and the three values of z 
are 7, 4, and 2. Hence, those of y are 9, 6, and 4, and those of x, 
-f |, -}- 1, and -f I, as before. 

474. If we solve the equation, x^ — 2x'' — 3a;^ -f 8x — 4 = 0, by 
the process of divisors, we will get the three values, -f 2, — 2, and 
— 1. And, by dividing the first member of the equation by the factors 
corresponding to these values, we will have left, x -f- 1 = 0. Hence, 
the value — 1 enters twice in the given equation. We see, from this 
example, that while the process of divisors gives the rational values, it 
does not show whether any or all of them are repeated once or more. 
This remark is evidently applicable to all equations whatever. Some 
test is then necessary, by which we can ascertain the equal values. 

EQUAL VALUES. 

475. Let the equation be 

(x — a)" {x — hy {x — cj (x—d) {x — e) &c. = (A), 

in which there are m values equal to a, to values equal to h, j^ values 
equal to c, and all the other values unequal. Calling D the differential 
coefficient of this equation, we will have (Art. 366), 

D = m (x — a)"-' (x — bf (x — c)p (x — d) (x — e) &c. + 
n (x — 6)"-' (x — a)" (x — cf (x — d) (x — e) &c. -\-p{x — c)p-' 
(x — a)" (x — 6)„ (x— c?)(x — c)&c. + (x— a)"'(x — J)"(x — c)P 
(x — e) &c. -f (x — a)" (x — 5)° (x — c)p (x — d) &c., plus other 
terms (B). 

It is plain that the greatest common divisor, D', between (A) and 
(B), will be 

D' = (x — a)"-' (x — &)"-' (x — c)P-'. 
We see that this divisor contains (m — 1) values equal to «, (n — 1) 
values equal to h, and (p — 1) values equal to c. Hence, it is plain 
that the number of equal values in each set of the greatest common 



4G0 GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 

divisor is one less than in the giv equation. Therefore, to ascertain 
whether there are equal values, we have this 



RULE. 

Find the differential coefficient of the first memher of the given equa- 
tion [or, as it is generally called, the first derived polynomial), next get 
the greatest common divisor hetiveen the first member of the pro^wsed 
equation and this differential coefficient, place this common divisor eqtial 
to zero, and find its values. Each independent value so found loill he 
repeated once oftener in the given equation than in the greatest common 
divisor ; if the latter, for instance, contain two values equal to a, and 
four values equal to b, the former loill contain three values equal to a, 
and five equal to b. If the greatest common divisor he of too high a 
degree to solve, we may find the second differential coefficient, or second 
derived polynomial of the given equation, then the greatest common 
divisor between this polynomial and the first memher of the given equa- 
tion. Each independent value of this common divisor will he re- 
peated tioice oftener in the given equation. 



EXAMPLES, 

1. Does the equation, x* — 2x^ + ^x^ — x-\-h = 0, contain equal 
values ? 

First derived polynomial, 4x' — 6a:^ + 3a; — 1. 

Greatest common- divisor, x — 1, which, placed equal to zero, gives 
cc = l. Hence, th|| given equation contains two values equal to 1. 
If we divide that equatipn by (x — Vf, w e will hav e left , x^ + l = Q. 
Hence, the other two values are + v/ — I, and — s/ — J- 

2. Does the equation, x^ — x^ — 14a;'' — 2Qx^ — 19a? — 5 = 0, con- 
tain equal values ? 

First derived polynomial, 5x^ — Ax^ — 420;^ — 52x — 19. 

Greatest common divisor, (x + 1)'. Hence, the given equation eon- 
tains four values equal to — 1, and, by dividing the equation by (x -f- 1)^, 
we find the other value to be + 5.

After dividing out the equal factors, (x + 2) (x + 2), we had a

The first greatest common divisor is x^ — x^ — a: + 1. As this, 
when placed equal to zero, is too high to solve, we find the greatest 
common divisor between the second differential coefficient of the given 
equation, and the first member of that equation, or, what amounts to 
the same thing, the greatest common divisor between x^ — x^ — x-\- 1, 
and its derived polynomial, Zx^ — 2a; — 1. This common divisor is 
(a; — 1)^ Hence, the given equation contains three values equal to 
plus one, and, by dividing out by the factors, (a; — 1) (x — 1) (a; — 1), 
or, x^ — Zx^ + 3a; — 1, we have left, a;^ + 2a; + 1 = 0. Hence, the

DERIVED POLYNOMIALS. 

476. We have liad occasion to use the relation, x = a-\- i/,m trans- 
forming the general equation in x into another in i/, such, that the 
second term was wanting. But the transformation in terms of y and a 
is of more general application. Sometimes a is an undetermined con- 
stant, whose value is afterwards determined in such a manner as to 
make the equation fulfil a given condition. Sometimes a is a deter- 
minate number or quantity, which expresses the difference between 
the values of the given equation and another which we wish to form. 
Suppose, for instance, we wished to transform the equation, x^ — x'^ + 
4a; 4- 5 = 0, into another in ?/, such, that each value of x should exceed 
by 2 each corresponding value of i/. Then, a must be made equal to 
2 in the relation, x = a + i/, and we must substitute 2 + y for x 
wherever it occurs. Hence, the equation in 7/ would be (2 -f- i/y — 
(2 -f 7/y + 4(2 -|- y) -f 5 = 0, or, expanding and reducing, ^ -f- 5^^ 
-f 12y -f 17 = 0. In this case, the transformation is easily effected 
by actually substituting the value of x in terms of y, and developing 
the several binomials in the new equation. But, when the given equa- 
tion is of a high degree, this process is tedious and impracticable. 
Suppose, for example, it were required to transform the equation, a;'^ — 
40a;" + x}°—2x^ + 8a;^ -f- 5x' — 4a;« + 9x' + 12.r^ — x^-{-Sx + 15 
= 0, into another in y, such, that the values of x should be less by 
unity than the corresponding values of y. Then, a = — 1 in the re- 
lation, X = a + ^, and we must substitute for x, wherever it occurs, 
(y — 1). It is plain that the development of the several binomials in 
the new equation will be exceedingly tedious. 

The method of derived polynomials enaUes us to effect the required 
transformation in y without suhstiiuiion and development. 

Let VIS resume the equation, 

^m ^ pa;n.-l _|_ Qa;m-2 -f To! -f U = 0, 

and let us suppose, as before, x = a-{- 1/. 

The new equation in y will then be 
(a + 2/T + P(« + ^/r-' + Q(« + y)"-' T(a-f y)+ U = 0. 

Let us assume 
(a -f 2/r + P(a +y)-' + Qia + ijT-' T(«. -f 2/) + U = A 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 463 

Making y=0, we get 

a" + Pa"-' + Qa"-' + Ta + U = A. 

Differentiating tlie given equation, and dividing by dy, we get

Now, make y = 0, and denote by A' what B becomes in tbat case, 
we get 

ma-"-' 4- (wi— 1) Pa'"-^ + (m— 2) Qa""-^ + T = B = A'. 

Differentiating (R), we get

(m — 3) Q(a + y)°'-» + &c. = 2C + 2 . 3Dy + 3 . 4E/ + &c. (S). 

Making y = 0, and representing by A" what 2C becomes, we get 

m(m — 1) a—2 + (m — 1) (m — 2) Pa""^ + (w — 2) (m — 3) Qa"-*

Then C == — ^ ^ (»^— 1) ft""" + (^?^ — 1) (m — 2) Pg-"-^ + &c.

By proceeding in the same way, all the other coefficients could be 
determined. But the law of formation is already apparent, A is what 
the given equation becomes when a (or the difference between x and^) 
is substituted for x ; A' is formed from A, by multiplying the coeffi- 
cient of a in every term by its exponent, and then diminishing that 

A" 

exponent by unity ; -^ is formed in precisely the same way, except 

A'" 
that the result is divided by 2 ; -5- is formed in like manner from A",

except that the result is divided by 3. 

A"" 

-J- is formed according to the same law from A'", the result being 

divided by 4.

EQUATION OF DIFFERENCES. 

478. We have now shown how all the rational values could be ob- 
tained, either by operating directly upon the given equation, when of 
the proposed form, or upon the transformed equation, and then, by means 
of the relations between the values in the transformed and given equa- 
tions, ascertain the rational values in the given equation. If we would 
next divide the given equation by the factors corresponding to its ra- 
tional values, and place the quotient resulting equal to zero, we would 
have a new equation containing only irrational and imaginary values. 
Before explaining the method of finding the irrational values, it becomes 
necessary to show how to find an equation, whose values shall be equal 
to the difierence of values in the given equation. Such an equation is 
called the equation of differences. 

Let x', x", x'", &c., be values in the given equation, and i/ a value 
in the equation of difiFerences sought. It is plain that this equation 
will be of the same form, whatever pair of values we assume in the 
given equation. Hence, we may assume y = oo' — x\ then a;" = 
y -f cc'. Since x" is, by hypothesis, a value in the given equation, .t° 

+ Px""-* -\- Qx'"-2 _|- Ta; + U = 0, by substitution, we will 

have a;'"» -f Px""-' -f Qx""-^ Trc" + U = 0. Now, if we 

replace aj" by y 4- ^' in this equation, and develop by the formula in 

7,2 

Article 477, the new equation will become Xq + X^y -\- Xarp— ^ + X3 

rz — ^ — ^ -j- &c. = ; in which Xq denotes what the given equation 

becomes when x' is substituted for .r, X, is the derived polynomial of 
Xoj X2 the derived polynomial of X„ &c., &c. But, since x' is, by 
hypothesis, a value, Xo is equal to zero, and, by dividing by y, the new 

equation becomes X, + ^^zr~ -f X3:j — '^ — -x -f &c. = (D), and is 



468 GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 

tlie equation, which combined with the given equation, will give the 
one sought. 

479. It is obvious that, to obtain (D), we have only to get the deri- 
vative of the first member of the given equation, add to this the second 
derived polynomial, multiplied by the first power of y, divided by 1 . 2, 
plus the third derived polynomial, multiplied by rf, divided by 1 . 2 . 3, 
plus other derived polynomials, multiplied by corresponding powers of 
y with their appropriate divisors. 

As a simple illustration, let it be required to find the equation of 
diiferences to the equation, x^ — 4 = 0. Then X, = 2x, X2 = 2, and 
(D) becomes 2a3 + y ==:; 0. Eliminating x between these equations, 
by the method of the greatest common divisor, we have, 

4x2 — lQ\2x-\-y 

4lx^ -f 2xy 2x — y = quotient. 

— 2x1/ — 16 

— 2xi/ — f 

1/^ — 16 = 0, equation of difi"erences. 

The values of y in this equation, are + 4 and — 4, and those of x 
in the given equation, + 2 and — 2, the difference between which is 
either + 4 or — 4. 

If in the equation, 7/^ — 16 = 0, we make 9/^ = z, we will have z — 
16 = 0, and the value of z will be equal to the square of the difference 
of the values of x. Such an equation is called the equation of the 
square of the differences. 

The degree of the equation of differences will be expressed by the 
number of combinations of m values, taken two and two, or by 
m^m — 1), and, since this product is always even whatever may be the 
value of m, the sought equation will always be of an even degree. 

As a second illustration, let it be required to find the equation of 
differences to the equation, x^ — x — 6 = 0. Then, X, = 2>x'^ — 1, 
X2 = 6x, X3 = 6, X4, X5, &c. = 0, and equation (D) becomes ox^ — 1 
-\- Zxy + if = ^ ; or, Zx^ + Zxy -\- if — 1 = ; and, preparing the 
given equation for division by multiplying by y, we have

Now, make y^ = z, and we have for the equation of the square of 
the differences a' — 6^^ + 9z + 968 = 0. 

In the above development, the alternate terms were struck out. This 
was to have been anticipated from what had been said. But we may 
show, in another manner, that the equation of differences can contain 
only even powers of y. 

For, let a, b, c, d, &c., be the numerical differences of the values of 
the given equation, then, + «, — a, -f i, — h, &c., will be values in the 
equations of differences; and, since the factors corresponding to these 
values, permuted in pairs, give us (t/ + a) (3/ — a), (j/ + l) (j/ — J), &c., 
the first member of the equation of differences will be, (jj^ — a^ (^'—-^^) 
(/-cO,&c. 

Now, making ^ = z, we will have (z — a") (~ — l") (z — c^) &c. = 
for the equation of the square of the differences. The degTce of the 
last equation will only be half as great as that of the equation of dif- 
ferences. 



EXAMPLES. 

1. Given, x^ — 9 = 0, to find the equation of differences. 

Ans. / — 86 = 0. 

2. Given, x' + 9x 4- 4 = 0, to find the equation of differences. 

Ans. / + 54/ + 81/ + 3348 = 0. 

After the first division the remainder will be, 2(//^ ^ 9) a; + y + 9?/ 
+ 12. Multiply the last divisor twice by 2(/ + 9). Then, 
after two divisions, you will have 4(/ + 9)' — 3(/ +9y — 12) 
(2/^ + ^2/ + 12), which will reduce to the expression above.

3. Given, x^+ ax + J = 0, to find the equation of differences. 

Ans. if + Qai/ -\- Da^ if + 4a^ + 27b"- = 0. 
First remainder is, 2(y^ +a'^)x + ?/ + oy + oh. Use 2(y^ + aF) twice 
as a multiplier. 

4. Given, x^ — a; = 0, to find tte equation of differences. 

Ans. y^ — 61/ + dy' — 4 = 0. 
First remainder is, 2(y'^ — 1) x + y^ — y. The coefiicient of x is 
used twice as a multiplier. 

It will be seen that + 1 and — 1 are values in the equation of dif- 
ferences. Dividing by y^ — 1, and solving the resulting equation, y'* — 
by'^ + 4 = 0, by the rules for binomial equations, we get the four values, 
-f 2, — 2, + 1 and — 1. The six values, then, in the equation of dif- 
ferences, are, + 2, — 2, and + 1 and — 1, repeated twice. These ought 
to be the values, since those in the given equation are, -f- 1 and — 1, 
the differences between which are those given above. 

IRRATIONAL VALUES. 

480. An equation, freed from the factors corresponding to the ra- 
tional values, will contain only irrational or imaginary values, or both 
irrational and imaginary values. We can best explain the process of 
finding the irrational values by an example. 

Let us take the equation, x^ — 2x'^ — 2 = 0, to find one positive 
rational value. The superior positive limit is, 1 + 1/2 = 3. Substi- 
tuting the natural numbers from up to 3, we find that and 1 give 
negative results when substituted for x in the equation, and that 2 
gives a positive result. Hence, a value of the equation lies between 1 
and 2, and 1 is the entire part of the irrational value. 

Now, make x = y + liu the given equation, then the new equation 
in y will have values less by unity than those in x. Hence, y will con- 
tain the decimal part of the value of x. This transformation can be 
most readily effected by the formula of Article 477. We have 

(1)5 — 2(1)^ — 2 = —3 = A. 
5(1)* — 6(1)2 = — 1 = A'. 
20(1)3 — 12(1)' = 8 ^j^n^ 
60(1)2 _ 12 = 48 == A'". 
120(1)» = 120 = A-. 
120 = 120 = A^

changing the order of terms, y^ -f- 5y* + Sy^ + 4?/* — y — 3 = 0. 

If, now, we make z = lOy, then y = — . The first figure, then, of 

the value of z, in the transformed equation, will be tenths in the value 
of y ; and, consequently, tenths in the value of x. The transformed 
equation (Article 467) is, 

^ + 502" + 800;^^ + 4000;^^ _ lOOOOj/ _ 300000 = 0. 
S. p. Limit = 1 + V300000 = 1 + 23 = 24. 

The limit is here too great for any practical use. Substituting, be- 
tween and 10, we find a change of sign in the results corresponding 
to the substitution of 5 and 6. For 5, we have, 

(5)H50(5)"+800(5)'+4000(5/— 10000(5) — 300000=— 115625. 

And 6 gives, 

(6)H50 (6)"+ 800 (6)='+4000 (6)^-10000(6)— 300000 = + 29376. 

Hence, 5 is the entire part of the value of z, and this corresponds to 
five-tenths in y and x. Tliereforc, 1 . 5 is the approximate value of a;, 
to within tenths. To get a nearer approximation, let us transform the 
equation in z into another in w, so that the values of to shall be less by 
5 than those of z. Then iv will contain the remaining part of the deci- 
mal value of z. The equation in w is, 

lo' -f 75^" -f 2050w' + 24750ii;=' -f 118125io — 115625 = 0. 

Making t = 10?p, or lo = — , the transformed equation in t (Art. 467), 

will be, 

i*-f750<"+205000i=' -1-24750000/2+1181250000^— 11562500000 = 0. 

On trial, we find that 8 and 9 give results with contrary signs ; hence, 
8 is the entire part of the value of t, and corresponds to -8 in w, and 
to .08 in y and x. We have, then, for the approximate value of x, 
1-58. The process would be, in all respects, the same, were a negative 
value to be found, except that we would find the negative limits. 

Let us take, as a second example, x^ — lOx' -{- 6x + 1 = 0. 

We find that and 1 give results with contrary signs, and so do 3

and that in z, 

z^ + I50z* + 80002» -f ISOOOOz^ + UlOOOOz — 800000 = 0. 

Substituting and 1, we find a change of sign. Hence, is the 
tenths of the given equation. Making z = + «;, we have, 

to' + IbOw* + 8000!«=' + 180000i«^ + 1410000«; — 800000 = 0. 

The equation in t, is, 

/'+1500<''+800000f^4-180000000«^+ 14100000000^— 80000000000=0. 

We find that 5 and 6, when substituted, give a change of sign. 
Now, make f = s+ 5, the equation in s will be, 

.s5_^175s^4-830250s^+192226280s2+15960753125s— 4899059375=0. 

By changing this into an equation in r, making r = 10s, we will find a 
change between 3 and 4. Hence, 3 053 is the approximat-e value of a; 
to within thousand tlis. 

481. In this process we have proceeded upon the hypothesis, that 
but one real root lay between two successive integers. To ascertain 
whether this is the case, we have only to transform the given equation 
in X into another in y, so that the values of y shall be the squares of 
the difi"erences of those of x. Next, find the inferior limit of the posi- 
tive values of y. Suppose D^ to be this limit ; then, since D^ is less 
than the least value in the equation of the square of the differences, 
v^D^, or D, will be less than the least difference between the values in 
the given equation. Now, if D be ^ 1, it is plain that no real root 
will be comprised between two successive integers, and the process 
described above can be pursued. A similar course of reasoning can 
be applied to D'^, the inferior limit of the negative values in the equa- 
tion of the squares of the differences. 

But, if D <^1, then two or more real roots may be comprised be- 
tween two consecutive integers. In this case, we have only to substi- 
tute a series of numbers, whose common difference shall be = or <^ D. 
Then, those numbers, which give results with contrary signs, will have 
but one real value between them. Another method of frequent appli- 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 473 

cation, when D is a proper fraction, -, is to transform the equation in x 

into another in y, by making x = -. Then, the differences of the values 

of y will be greater than unity, and only one real root will lie between 
the successive integers in the transformed equation. For, let x' and 

x" be consecutive values of x, then x' = -, and x" = — . Hence, 

r r 

(x' — x") r = y' — y". Then the differences between the consecutive 

values of 2/ is r times greater than between those of x, and, as r is the 

denominator of D, y' — y" must be greater than unity.

zero. 

8. Find one irrational value in the equation, x* + x^ — 25x^ — 26a;

482. If we apply the foregoing process to an example of the form, 

x* + 14x^ — 49 = 0, the consecutive numbers will give no change of 

sign. One value in the equation of differences will be found to be 

zero, and also one in the equation of the square of the differences.

474 GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 

D'^ and D are tliea botli zero. "When this is the case, we may infer the 
presence of equal values. Ou trial, as in Art. 475, we find x^ — 7 the 
greatest common divisor between the first member of the given equa- 
tion and its derived polynomial. We see, by this example, that the 
preceding method is only applicable to equations which have been freed 
from their equal values. 

While the foregoing method afi'ords a complete solution to the pro- 
blem of finding the irrational values of numerical equations, yet it is 
of diificult application to equations of high degrees, and, in all equa- 
tions, whether of low or high degrees, the difl&culty increases with the 
number of decimal places sought. 

NEWTON'S METHOD OF APPROXIMATION. 

483. This is known as the method of successive substitutions, and 
consists in substituting, in the given equation, the natural numbers be- 
tween the limits, until results with contrary signs are obtained. Let a 
be the least of two consecutive numbers which give results with con- 
trary signs. Then a is the first figure, or entire part of the value 
sought. Substitute a -{- y for x in the given equation, y being a small 
fraction, whose second and higher powers may be neglected. Hence, y 
may be found in the transformed equation, and a + y will constitute 
the first approximation to the value of x. Let a -1- y be denoted by h, 
and make x = h -{■ y', y' being a small fraction, whose higher powers 
may be neglected. The transformed equation will give the value of 
y, and this, with 6, will constitute the second approximation to x. 
Calling h + y', c, and making x = e + y" , we can get a third approxi- 
mation to the value of x, and may thus carry the approximation to as 
many places of decimals as we please. 

Let us take, as an illustration, the equation, a;* — 2 =0. Substi- 
tuting between the limits, we find that 1 and 2 give different signs. 
Then 1 is the entire part of the value. Make a; = 1 -f y, and reject 
y^, we will have 1 -j- 2^/ — 2 = 0, or y = J = -5. Hence, for first 
approximation, x = 1-5. Now, make x = 1-5 +y, and we will have, 

•25 

after rejecting y'\ 2-25 + 3/ — 2 = 0, or, / = — -^ = — -0833. 

Then, for the second approximation, we get cc = 1 -5 — -0833 = 1-4167. 
Place X = 1-4167 + y", we get 

2-8834/' = — -00303889, or, y" = — -00107. 
Then, for a third approximation, x = 1-4167 — -00107 = 1-41563. 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 475 

484. The accuracy of the process evidently depends upon the un- 
known quantity introduced being a small fraction. "Whenever, then, 
the substitution of the natural numbers make y an improper fraction, 
more minute substitutions must be made, unless we intend to carry the 
approximation to several places of decimals. 

Thus, take the example, x'' + x — 8 =; 0, we find that 1 and 2 give 
results with contrary signs. Then, 1 is the entire part of the value 
sought. Making x = y + 1, we have, 3/^ + 3y + 3^^ + 1 -|- y + 1 
— 8 = 0, or, rejecting the higher powers of y, 4^/ — 6 = 0. Hence, 
y ■= &=. 1*5, an improper fraction. Then, for the first approximation, 
we have, x ^ 2-5, a result obviously too great. 

Next, place x = 2-50 + ?/, we have, after rejecting higher powers 
of y, (2-50)» + 3 (2-50)2y + 2-50 + y — 8 = 0. Then, y' = — -512, 
and, for the second approximation, x = 1-988. Making now x ^ 
1-988 + y" , we will have, after rejecting the higher powers of if' ■> 

(1-988)'' + 3 (l-988)y' 4- 1-988 + y"— 8 = 0, 
or, 7-856862272 + ll-856432y'+ 1-988 -f y" — 8 = 0, 
or, 11-856432/' = _ 1-844862272. 

Hence, y" = — -144 nearly, and, for a third approximation, x = 1-844, 
which difi'ers from the true value by less than one hundredth. We 
see, from this example, that the error was considerable when y was an 
improper fraction, but became reduced by carrying the approximation 
farther. A closer approximation could have been obtained, without 
carrying the operation so far, by making minute substitutions. A 
change of sign would have been found between the results corresponding 
to 1-8 and 1-9. 

LAGRANGE'S METHOD. 

485. This differs from Newton's, in that the unknown expression 
added to complete each successive value is fractional in form, and in 
that the transformation is made into an equation involving this un- 
known quantity. Thus, let a be the entire part or number next below 

the value, we make x = a H — , and get a transformed equation in y, 

such, that the values of y must be greater than unity. Let h be the 
entire part of the value of y, then, for the first approximation, we have 

a: = a 4- - = — . Next, place y = & A — . The transformed 

equation iu ^ must have its values greater than unity. Let c be the 



476 GENERAL THEORY OP EQUATIONS. 

entire part of tlie value of y' . Then, approximatively, y = h ■{ — = 

, and, for a second approximation to x, we have, x ^ a -^^ - = a 

c . . 1 

+ -. To find a third approximate value for x, let y = c -| — j^ 

CO -\- I y 1 

and we may thus continue to approximate to the value of x until the 

result is as accurate as desired. 

To apply these principles, let us take the equation, x^ — x — 5 = 0, 

We see that 1 and 2 give contrary signs, hence, cc = 1 + -. Substi- 
tuting this value of cc, we have 5^^ — 2f/^ — 3y — 1 = 0. The entire 
part of the value of y is 1, hence, for first approximation to x, we have 

X — \ ■\ — = 1 + 1 = 2, which is plainly too great. Next, making 

y = 1 + -, we get y'^ — %y'^ — 13/ — 5 = 0. In this, 9 and 10 

give contrary signs. Then, y = 1 + -^ = Lo, and a; — 1 + y^^ = 12^ 
fbr the second approximation. 

Now, make ?/' = 9 -| — ^, and the transformed equation in y" will be, 

4iy"' — 86^"^ — 19y' — 1 =: ; a change of sign between the re- 
sults given by 2 and 3. Hence, y' = 9| = i^^, y = 1 + -2^ = |^, 
and a; = 1 -f ^a = |fl, for the third approximate value of x. We find 
on trial the third approximate value a little too great, and the second a 
little too small. Hence, the true value lies between 4f ^^^^ io> ^^^ 
either of these numbers diflPers from the true value by less than ^ jq. 

486. Let us take the simple example, x^ — 2 = 0. Place x=^\ •\ — , 

y 

then, y — 1y — 1 = 0. We find that 2 and 8 give contrary signs. 

Hence, for first approximation, x = 1 + i = |. Now, make ?/ = 2 -f- -» 

and the equation in y will become y'"^ — 2y — 1 = 0; and, again, 2 is 
the entire part of the value. Hence, y = 2 + i == 55 and x=^\ -\- \ 
= I, for a second approximation. On trial, we find | too great, and | 
too small, and these differ from each other by a tenth j therefore, the true 
value differs from either by less than a tenth. For a third approximate 
value we would find, x = |-|, which is a little too great, but is within 
g'jj of the true value. The fourth approximate value, ||, is too small, 
but differs from the true value by less than g-J-, • By continuing thus 
the process, we would find the approximations alternately too great and 



GENERAL THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 477 

too small, and thus can tell at every step how near we have come to the 
true values. We see that Lagrange's method enables us to determine 
the proximity to the true value at every stage of the work, and this is 
the chief advantage claimed for it over the process of Newton.

GENERAL SOLUTION OF NUMERICAL EQUATIONS, 

487. When we have a numerical equation of any degree to solve, we 
must first find its rational values by the process of divisors, if it is under 
the proposed form. But, if it is not, we must transform it into another 
equation in y, so that the coefficient of the first term shall be plus 
unity, and the other coefficients entire. Then, knowing the relation be- 
tween 1/ and X, we can determine the values of x when those of y have 
been found. Next we must ascertain whether any of the values are 
repeated (Art. 475). Having thus found all the rational values, we 
next divide by the factors corresponding to them. Then, by means of 
the equation of the squares of the difi'crenccs, we can ascertain what 
series of numbers to substitute in the reduced equation (Art. 481). The 
final step is to find, approximatively, the irrational values by either of 
the three processes explained. Now, if the number of rational and ir- 
rational values be subtracted from the degree of the given equation, the 
difference will be the number of imaginary values.

STUEM'S THEOREM. 

488. When we have, by means of the process of divisors and the 
method of equal values, detected all the rational values, and then, by 
the aid of the equation of differences, discovered all the irrational 
values, we can determine the number of imaginary values, by subtract- 
ing the number of rational and irrational values from the degree of the 
equation. When this difference is zero, there are, of course, no imagi- 
nary values. 

But this method is circuitous, and is, moreover, rendered tedious by 
the employment of the equation of differences. Sturm's Theorem de- 
termines directly the number of imaginary values, and dispenses tcith 
the equation of differences. 

Let X = x™ -f Pa;-"-' -f Q^c--^ + +Ta: + U = ie aji equa- 
tion cleared of its equal values. Take the derivative of X, and call it 

X' ; then, X' = mx^-'-\- (m — l)Px"»-2-f (m — 2)Qx'°-^ -f- -f T. 

Now, divide X by X', and continue the division until we get a remaiur 
der in a; of a lower degree than X'. Call this remainder, with its sign 
changed, X". Divide X', in like manner, by X", and continue the 
division until the remainder is a degree lower than the divisor. Change, 
in the same way, the signs of all the terms of this remainder, and call 
the resulting expression X'". Pursue the same process until we get a 
remainder independent of x, which must be so eventually, since the 
given equation, by hypothesis, contains no equal values. This will be 
the (m — 1)*'' remainder, and all the expressions, including X and X', 



Sturm's theorem. 479 

will make up (m + 1) functions. Hence, designate by X^+'j tlie last 
remainder, with its sign changed. We will then have the following 
expressions, Q, Q', &c., designating quotients : 

X =X'Q -X" (A), 

X' =X"Q' —X'" (B), 

X" = X"'Q" — X- (C), 

X'" = X'vQ"' — X- (D), 

X- = X-Q-— X- (E), 



X»-' = X-'Q"->— X»+' (W). 

In preparing the dividends for division, we may, as in the process 
for finding the greatest common divisor, multiply by any positive con- 
stant. In like manner, we may suppress any positive constant common 
to all the terms of any of the successive remainders. 

489. The theorem we have to demonstrate may be enunciated as 
follows : 

If we substitute any number, tn, for x in the above series of func- 
tions, X, X', X", &c., and count the variations of signs in the results, 
and then substitute any other number, as n, for x in the same series, 
and count again the variations of signs in the results, the difference 
between the number of variations in the tico cases icill exjjress exactly 
the number of real values between the numbers m a7id n. If, then, m be 
taken as the superior limit of the positive values, and n as the superior 
limit of the negative values, the difibrencc between the number of vari- 
ations will express the total number of real values. When this difiFe- 
rence is zero, there are no real values ; when it is equal to the degree 
of the equation, all the values are real. 

490. The demonstration of the theorem depends upon the four fol- 
lowing principles : 

1. M) tico consecutive finctions can vanish for the same value of x. 

For, if two functions, as X" and X'", could disappear together, equa- 
tion (C) would give = — X'^. Hence, X'^ = 0, and X"' and X*'' 
being zero, equation (D) would give X^ = 0. And so all the func- 
tions in succession would become zero, until we would finally have 
X^^' ^ 0. But this would indicate a common divisor, and, conse- 
quently, equal values, which is contrary to the hypothesis with which 
we set out. 



480 Sturm's theorem. 

2, When such a value is given to x as to make any function other 
than'K equal to zero, the functions adjacent to the one disajij^earing will 
he affected with contrary/ signs. 

For example, let X'^ = 0. Then, equation (D) will give X'"=— X^; 
and, since the own sign of X'^ may be either plus or minus, this equa- 
tion may be written X'" = — (± X^). Now, if X'^ be affected with 
the positive sign, the second member will be negative; and, since the 
signs of the two members of an equation must ^ways be the same, X"' 
will be negative, and, therefore, of a contrary sign to X'^. But, if the 
own sign of X^ be negative, then the second member will be positive. 
Hence, X'" will be positive, and, therefore, of a contrary sign to X^. 

3. The disappearance of any function other than 'Kfor a piarticidar 
value ofx, will neither increase nor decrease the variations of signs in 
the results of the sej'ies, X, X', X", d;c. 

Suppose that one of the intermediate functions, as X'"', becomes zero, 
for the value x = b. Then, by the first principle, neither X'" nor 
X'^ can be zero for x = I ; and, by the second principle, they must 
have contrary signs. There is, then, one variation of sign between X'" 
and X"^ when x = b. We are to show that this variation was not 
caused by the disappearance of X'''. For, however little x ■=h may 
differ from a value of X'" or X''^, h may be taken smaller than this 
difference. And, moreover, since a quantity can only change its sign 
in passing through zero or infinity, it is plain that, between x = b and 
x = b — h, neither X'" nor X^ can undergo any change of sign. They 
will still be affected with contrary signs, and, for cc = & — h, we will 
have either + X'", ± X'', — X^, or else, — X'", ± X'^, + X\ We 
affect X'' with the ambiguous sign, since we do not know whether its 
sign is positive or negative. Now, read the double sign either way, 
and take either of the preceding expressions, and you will have one 
variation. Hence, before x arrives at the value b, which causes the 
disappearance of X"', the three successive functions give one variation. 
Now, when x passes beyond b, and becomes b + h (h being less than 
the difference between b and a value of either X'", or X"), X'" will 
change its sign, but X'" and X" will not. Hence, forx:=h-\- h, we 
will have either + X'", =f X'", — X^ or — X'", =p X'", + X'. And, 
reading the ambiguous sign either way, in either of the above expres- 
sions, we will have one variation. Hence, both before and after x 
reached the value b, which made X''' = 0, we find a variation of sign 
among the three functions. Then x:=b, or the vanishing of the inter- 
mediate function, X'\ has not caused that variation. 



Sturm's theorem. 481 

4. Every passage ofS. through zero causes a loss of one variation 
xchen x is ascending towards the superior positive limit, or again of 
one variation throughout the series, X, X', &c., when x is descending 
toioards the superior negative limit. 

For, let a; = a be a value in the equation, X = 0, and take u lesp 
than the difference between a and a value of X'. Then, X will have 
a different sign, when a + u is substituted for x, from what it would 
have were a — u substituted for x. Hence, in the passage of x from 
a — u to a + M, X will undergo a change of sign, but X' will not. 
since, by hypothesis, no value of X' is passed over. Neither will any 
intermediate function, X", X'", &c., undergo a change of sign unless it 
pass through zero, and, by the third principle, such passage will not 
affect the total number of variations. Therefore, in the passage of x 
from a — « to a + u, either a permanence, existing between X and 
X', is changed into a variation, or else a variation is changed into a 
permanence. 

We will now examine the order in which this change takes place. 

Designate by X, what X becomes when x = a — u. Next, develop 

all the terms of X by Art. 456; we will have Xi= A — A'm + 

A"«^ A"'m' 

-j — -y — ^j — -^ — r, + &c> (R)) in which A denotes what X becomes 

when xz=a; A' is the derivative of A, A" the derivative of A', &c. 
But, since a is a value of .r, A must be equal to zero. Then, equation 

(R) may be written, X,= — u {M — i-^ + ,^" — &c.) Now. 

u may be taken so small that the first term will be greater than the 
algebraic sum of all the other terms within the brackets. Hence, the 
sign of the quantities within the parenthesis will depend upon that of 
A'. If, therefore, the own sign of A' is positive, the second member 
will be negative. Then, X, must be negative, and, therefore, of a con- 
trary sign to A'. But, if the own sign of A' be negative, the second 
member will be positive. Then, X, will be positive, and X, and A' 
will be affected with contrary signs. And, since X, and A' represent 
what X and X' become when a — tt is substituted for x, we see that 
there is a variation of signs between these functions below a value, 
x = u, which satisfies the equation, X = 0. Now, suppose x = a -\- u, 
and, therefore, above a value in the equation, X = 0. Develop as 
before, designating by Xa what X becomes when a -f u takes the place 

A"?f A"'u^ 
of X. Then, X2 = u (A' + ~ — -^ + ,^ ,^ + &c.), in which u is 

41 *2p " 



482 Sturm's theorem. 

so small that the sign of A' controls that of the parenthesis. We see, 
that, whether the own sign of A' be positive or negative, Xg must be 
affected with the same sign. Hence, when x = a -{- ^l, and, therefore, 
above a value, there is a permanence of sign between X and X'. 
Therefore, in the passage of x towards the superior positive limit, a 
variation is lost, and changed into a permanence between X and X', 
whenever X becomes equal to zero ; and, as the other functions neither 
gain nor lose variations, one variation only is lost throughout the entire 
series whenever X = 0. 

If we had begun with a + m, and passed down to a — u, it is evi- 
dent that one variation would have been gained, every time that x 
reached a value in the equation, X = 0. 

So, then, whenever x, increasing or decreasing by insensible degrees, 
reaches a value which will satisfy the equation, X = 0, one variation 
is lost or gained in the signs of the series, X, X', X", &c. Hence, if 
we take any number, as m, and substitute it for x in all the functions, 
and count the number of variations in the signs of the results, and then 
take any other number, as n, and treat it in like manner, the difference 
between the number of variations in the two cases will express the 
number of real values lying in the given equation between m and 7i. 
Moreover, it is plain that if «i = + oo, and n — — go, this difference 
will express the total number of real values in the equation. This 
would be equally true if we used the superior positive limit and the 
superior negative limit. But, there is this advantage in the employ- 
ment of -I- oo, and — oo ; the substitution need only be made in the 
leading term of the successive functions, for then the sign of this 
term would control the signs of all the other terms in the same 
function. 

491. Having determined the number of real values, the next step is 
to determine the initial figure of each one of theSe values. To do this, 
we substitute the natural numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, &c., until we get the 
same number of variations of signs in the entire series as was given by 
+ 00. The number that gives the same variations, as + oo, is the 
superior positive limit. Substitute, in like manner, 0, — 1, — 2, 

— 3, &c., until we get the same number of variations as given by 

— oo. We then have the superior negative limit. The least of the 
numbers, whether positive or negative, between which a variation is 
lost or gained, is the initial figure, or entire part of a real value. 
Should there be two or more variations lost or gained between consecu- 



Sturm's theorem. 483 

numbers, then there are as many values as there are changes of sign, 
which have the same initial figure. 

We will illustrate by a simple example, -■^'i^ 

Take equation, x^ + 3*'' — 1 = =*a:."~ • Then its derivative, 
X' = 3x2 ^ g^ 

Now, multiply all the terms of X by 9, and divide by X'. After 
two divisions, we will get a remainder of a lower degree than X' ; this 
is — 2x — 9. Change its sign, and call it X". Then, X" = 2a; + 9. 
Multiply X' by 4, and, after two divisions, by X", we will have a re- 
mainder, + 207. Hence, X'" = — 207, and we will have 

X = x'-f a;2 — 1=0 
X' =3^2 + 2a; 
X" = 2a; -f 9 
X" = — 207. 

Making a; = + oo, in the leading terms of these functions, the order 
of the signs will be 

+ + -1 , one variation. 

And for 03 = — oo, it will be 

1 , two variations. 

Hence, 2 — 1 = 1, real value. 

To find the initial figure of this value, make a; = 0, 1, 2, 3, &c., 
and write the signs of the results beneath their respective functions. 
We will have 

X, X', X", X'", 
then, a; = 0, — 1, 0, -f 9, — 207, two variations. 
X = 1, ''^• 1, +5, +11, — 207, one variation. 

Hence, 1 is the superior limit of the value sought, and is its initial 
figure. The decimal part of the value can be found by the process for 
the irrational values. 

The transformed equation in y,\s, y^ -\- y^ — 1 =: ; and that in z, 
z' + \^z^ — 1000 = 0. And, since 7 and 8 give results with con- 
trary signs, 7 is the tenths of the required value. Then, a; = 0-7 is 
an approximate value of x. 

The approximation may be carried as far as desired by the method 
of irrational values. 



484 Sturm's theorem. 

We need not substitute 0, — 1, — 2, &c., in the equation, since 
there is but one real value, and that has been shown to be positive. 

492. Whenever only one variation is lost between two consecutive 
numbers, Sturm's theorem affords no advantage over the process for 
finding the irrational values, except that of detecting directly the num- 
ber of imaginary values. But, when there are two or more real values 
comprised between two consecutive numbers, we are enabled by means 
of the theorem to dispense with the equation of differences, which 
otherwise must be employed to find the decimal part of those values. 
We will now explain the chief advantage of the theorem. 

Let us take the equation, x" — loi? — 1x^ -f 4 = 0. We will have 
the following series of functions : 

X = cc^ — 2x' — 2a;=' + 4 = 0, 

X'^Sx" — 6x2 — 4x, 

X" = 4x' + 6x2 — 20, 

X'" = — 42x2 — 168x + 300, 

X'' = — 2880x + 3840, 

X' = — , a constant. 

+ oo gives 4- + + H , one variation, 

— cx) gives 1 1- H ) four variations. 

Hence, there are three real values. 
Proceeding as before, we have 

X, X', X", X'", X''', X\ 



When, X = 
" x = 1 

" x= 2

three variations, 
three" variations, 
one variation. 



Since + 2 gives the same number of variations as -f oc, it is the 
superior positive limit. Moreover, as there are two variations lost be- 
tween 1 and 2, there are two real values between them. Had we sub- 
stituted the natural numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, &c., in the given equation, we 
would have found no change of sign, because an even number of values 
lay between consecutive numbers. To detect these values, without 
the aid of Sturm's theorem, we must either have recourse to the equa- 
tion of differences, or to minute and tedious substitutions. 



Sturm's theorew. 485 

So, then, it is evident that whenever an equation contains two, four, 
six, or any number of even values between consecutive numbers, Sturm's 
theorem enables us to detect these values in the shortest possible manner. 

493. But, in addition to this, the theorem gives us the means of 
finding the decimal part of the irrational values in a shorter and better 
manner than by the usual process, as we will now show. 

Since 1 is the entire part of both the irrational values, the first step, 
according to the usual process for finding the irrational values, is to 
transform the equation in x into another in y, so that the values of i/ 
shall be less by unity than those of x. 

The transformed equation in y is 

/ + 5/ + 8/ + 2y ^ - 5y + 1 = 0, 

and that in z, is 

z^ + 502" + 800z' + 20002^ — 500002 + 100000 = 0. 

We find, on trial, that 0, 1, and 2 give positive results ; 3 and 4 
give negative results; 5, and all numbers above 5, give, again, positive 
results. Hence, 2 and 4 are the tenths of the sought values; and 
1-2, and 1'4 are those values, approximatively. 

Now, if, in the transformed equation in z, two values had lain be- 
tween consecutive numbers, we must have had recourse either to 
mihute substitutions, or to the equation of differences. If, for instance, 
the second value had been 1-26 instead of 1-4, the tenths would have 
been the same for both values, and the substitution of the natural num- 
bers in 2 would have given no change of sign. 

To obviate a difficulty that might occur in more than one of the 
transformed equations, we proceed thus. 

We take all the functions, X, X', X", &c., and transform them into 
others in y, so that the values of y shall differ from those of x, by the 
initial figure, which, in this case, is unity. We will then have the 

Y = / + 5y' + 8/ + 2/ — 5y + 1, 
Y' = by' + 20y« + 24/ + 4y — 5, 
Y" = 4/-M8/-f24y_10, 
Y'".==- 42/ -252^ + 90, 
Y'^ ^ — 2880^ + 960, 
Y" = — , a constant. 
41* 



486 s»urm's theorem. 

After having found Y, as indicated, we may get its derivative, Y', 
and then divide Y by Y', and proceed as we did when getting the 
functions, X, X', X", &c. But, in genei-al, the better method is to 
transform the functions in x into others in y, so tliat the values of y 
shall be less than those of x, by the initial figure of the sought value. 



msformed functions in z are : 

= z5 ^ 50z^ + 800z» + 2000z^ — 50000z + 100000, 
' = 5^" + 2002^ + 24002^ + 4000z — 50000, 



The transformed functions in z are : 

Z = 

Z'_.„ . , , 

Z" = \z^ + ISOz^ + 2400z_ 10000, 
Z'" = _42z2 — 2520z + 9000, 
Z" = — 2880z + 9600, 
Z' = — , a constant. 

And we have the following results :

We need go no further in the substitution, since 5 gives the same 
number of variations as + oo. We see that there is a variation lost 
between 2 and 3, and another between 4 and 5. Hence, 2 and 4 are 
the tenths in the required values, as we before found. Now, if there 
had been two, or any number of values having the same initial decimal 
figure, 3, for example, there would have been as many variations lost 
or gained as there were values having the same initial decimal. 

494. We see, then, the two great advantages of Sturm's theorem in 
finding the irrational values over the other three processes described : 
1st. When an equation comprises an even number of values between 
two consecutive numbers, it enables us to detect these values without 
minute substitutions, or the employment of the equation of diiferences. 
2d. When two or more values have the same initial decimal figure, it 
enables us to tell the exact number of those values. If we add to these 
two advantages the one first mentioned, that of detecting directly the 



Sturm's theorem. 487 

number of real, and, consequently, the number of imaginary values, we 
can see how important the theorem is. 

To get the hundredths, the functions in z may be transformed into 
others in s, so that the values of s shall differ from those of z by the 
initial decimal figures ; in this case, 2 and 4. Then, again, transform 
the functions in s into others in lo, so that the values of w shall be ten 
times greater than those of s. We will then have a series of functions, 
W, W, W", W", &c., in which we may substitute the natural num- 
bers, 0, 1, 2, &c., until we get as many variations as -j- oo gives in the 
series. The least of the consecutive numbers, between which a loss of 
variation occurs, will be hundredths in the sought value. We, of 
course, will have two series of functions in to, the one corresponding to 
2, as the initial figure of decimals, and the other to 4. 

495. Since there were three real values in the equation, x^ — 2x' — 
2x^ + 4 = 0, and we have found but two positive values, the other 
must be negative. To determine this negative value, let us resume 
the functions, 

X = x5 — 2x' — 2x^ + 4 = 0, 

X' = 5a;'' — Qx^ — 4:X, 

X" = 4x» + 6x'' — 20, 

X'" = — 42a;2 — 168x + 300, 

X'' = — 2880x + 3840, 

X" := — , a constant. 

2, — 3, &c., in the foregoing series, we will 

X", x^ 

+ — , three variations, 
+ — , three variations, 
+ — , four variations. 

And, since — 2 gives the same number of variations as — oc, it is 
the superior negative limit. And, since a gain of variation occurs be- 
tween — 1 and — 2, the entire part of the negative value is — 1. In 
this case, we know that there is but one negative value ; we may then 
proceed at once to find the decimal part of this value by the usual 
process for irrational values, without forming the functions, Y, Y', 
Y"; &c.

and that in z. 

z5_ 502^ + SOO^^' — 6000/ + 30000z + 300000 = 0. 

A change occurs between 4 and 5. Hence, 4 is the tenths of the 
sought value, and we have x — — 1-4 for the approximate value. 
Now, diminish the values in the equation in z by 4, and the trans- 
formed equation in s will be

A change of sign occurs between the results after the substitution 
of — 1 and — 2. Hence, 1 is the hundredths of the negative value. 
And we have, for a second approximation, x = — 141. 

Hemarh. 

496. There is one point of considerable importance in the demon- 
oration, which deserves to be attended to. It has been shown that a 
variation is lost or gained between X and X', every time that X be- 
comes equal to zero, or that x passes a value. It might be asked, then, 
Why not confine the substitutions to X and X' ? 

It is to be observed, that a change of variation only takes place be- 
tween X and X' when very minute substitutions are made. For, in 
the demonstration of the fourth principle, we supposed ii to be indefi- 
nitely small. Now, if we substitute a number, p, which will make the 
signs of X and X' contrary, and again substitute another, jj', there being 
two values of X, and none of X', between p andp', then X and X' will 
still be affected with contrary signs. So, that, between p and p', there 
will be no change of variation, though there are two real values. But, 
if one value of X' lies between p and p', there will be one variation 
lost, and but one. For, whilst X changes its sign twice, X' will change 
its sign once. 

Take X = ex'' — 5u; ^- 1 ; then, X' = 12x — 5. 



stuem's theorem. 489 

There is a variation between X and X' when x = 0, and this is 
changed into a permanence when x = 1. There are two values of X 
between and 1, and one of X'. 

Again, if there were three, five, or any odd number of values of X 
passed over, and none of X', there would be one variation lost or 
gained, and but one. But, if, at the same time, an odd number of 
values of X' were passed over, there would be no change of variation. 
It is plain, then, that the loss and gain of variation between X and X' 
will only correspond to the number of real values, when the substitu- 
tions are so minute that no value of either X or X' is contained be- 
tween them. 

Scholium. 

497. Whenever any function is constantly positive for all values of 
X, we need not form any other functions, but only count the number 
of variations given by + oo, and — oo, in the constantly positive func- 
tion, and in the functions which precede it. For, if we formed the 
succeeding functions, they would give tlie same number of variations 
for -(- CO that they would for — oo. Hence, the difference between 
the number of variations of these functions must always be zero. To 
show this, we take for granted that a function, which always remains 
positive for all values of x, must be of an even degree, since it will 
contain only imaginary values. The next succeeding function may 
have its leading term either positive or negative, but the nest must be 
negative, since any value that reduces the function, consecutive with the 
positive one to zero, must cause the adjacent functions to be affected 
with contrary signs. All the functions of an odd degree may be either 
positive or negative, but those of an even degree must be alternately 
positive and negative. 

Let x^ + mx^ + &c., be the constantly positive function. We will 
then have the series,

Now, suppose the ambiguous sign to be plus througliout, we will 
have for -f oo, these results, 

+ H h + H J 3 variations, 

and for — oo, these results, 

-\ 1 , 3 variations. 

Next, suppose the ambiguous sign to be minus throughout, then, 
— 00 will give 

+ -\ H + H J 3 variations, 

and + oo will give

We will find like results when some of the ambiguous signs are 
taken as positive, and the rest as negative.

DESCARTES' RULE. 

498. ^4.?!. equation cannot have a cp-eater number of negative values 
than there are permanences of sign from + to +, or* from — to — ; 
nor can it have a greater number of positive values than there are 
variations of sign from + to — , or from — to -\- . 

When the adjacent terms of an equation are affected with the same 
sign, a permanence is said to exist between them ; and when they are 
affected with contrary signs, there is a variation between them. 

In applying Descartes' rule to an equation, every sign is read twice, 
except the first and last. Thus, in the equation, x* — 4x^ -f 12a;^ + 
X — 5 = 0, there is a variation between the first and second terms, a 
variation between the second and third terms, a permanence between 
the third and fourth terms, and a variation between the fourth and 
fifth terms. In all, there are three variations and one permanence. 



492 DESCARTES' RULE. 

When a term is missing from an equation, it must be supplied witli 
tlie coefficient, ± 0. Then, in reading the signs, we must first count 
the variations and permanences, regarding the ambiguous sign as posi- 
tive, and then count again, regarding the ambiguous sign as minus. 
Thus, taking the equation, x^ — 4 = 0, we must write it x^ ±0x — 
4 = 0. Counting the upper sign, we have a permanence between the 
first and second terms, and a variation between the second and third 
terms. Counting the lower sign, we have a variation between the first 
and second terms, and a permanence between the second and third 
terms. In whatever way, then, we read the ambiguous sign, there will 
be one permanence, and one variation. 

If there are any number of missing terms, they must be supplied in 
like manner with positive or negative zero coefficients. 

499. To demonstrate the rule of Descartes, it is necessary to show 
that the multiplication of any equation by a factor, corresponding to a 
negative value, will introduce into the new equation at least one more 
permanence than existed in the old ; and that the multiplication by a 
factor, corresponding to a positive value, will introduce at least one 
more variation. 

1st, Let us take the equation, x"' — Px"-' + Qx'^-^ + Rx™"" — 
Sa;""^ . . . . + Tx — U ^ 0, and multiply by a factor, x + a, corres- 
ponding to a negative value. The resulting equation will be 

a;m+l_p|.^n, + Qbm-> + R|x'»-^— S|x»-=' -fTlx"— Ulx = 

-fal — Pal +Qa\ +'Ra\ — Sal +Tal— Ua ^■' 

Now, it is plain that, if we suppose the coefficients in the upper 
column are, throughout, greater than the corresponding coefficients in 
the lower column, there will be the same number of permanences in 
the new as in the old equation, until we get to the last two coefficients 
(the coefficients of x and x°), we will then have one more permanence 
than in the given equation. And, if we suppose the coefficients of the 
lower column to be greater throughout, there will be a new permanence 
between the first and second terms, and the same succession of signs in 
the remaining terms. Moreover, it is evident, that if the lower column 
sometimes prevailed, and sometimes did not, there might be more than 
one permanence introduced. For instance, if a were greater than P, 
Pa less than Q, Ra greater than S, T greater than Sa, Ta greater than 
U, there would be but one variation in the new equation. 



DESCARTES' RULE. 493 

It is even possible to change all the variations into permanences, by 
multiplication by a factor corresponding to a negative value. As an 
illustration, take the equation, x^ — 2a;* + \2x* — 8x^ + 36x- — x •\- 
15 = 0, and multiply by cc + 4. The new equation will be, 

x-' — 2.\x^ + 11\x^— Slx^ + 36|a;3— 1 j x^ + 15 Ix = 
+ 41 —si + 48 I — 32 I + 144 I — 4 | + 60' 

or, x' + 2a;« + ^x' + 40^" + 4x=' + 143x'= + llx + 60 = 0. 

By this example we see that an equation, containing only variations, 
is changed into another containing only permanences, by multiplying 
the former by a factor corresponding to a negative value. Seven per- 
manences have been introduced where none existed before. And, by 
recurrence to equation (M), we see that it is impossible to read the 
signs in any order, without having one more permanence than in the 
given equation. Now, the given equation may have been one of the 
first degree, m being equal to one, and P, Q, K, S, and T being equal 
to zero. Then, if the sign of U were positive, there would be one 
negative value, and conversely. The new equation (after multiplica- 
tion by x + ci) would be of the second degree, and would contain, at 
least, one more permanence than the old. And, by multiplying this 
new equation by another factor corresponding to a negative value, we 
would introduce, at least, one more permanence. And so, by contiuu 
ing the process, it could be shown that, whatever might be the degree 
of the equation, the number of permanences must always be equal to, 
or exceed the number of negative values. 

500. 2d. By a similar course of reasoning, we could show that the 
the multiplication by a factor corresponding to a positive value would 
introduce, at least, one variation ; or, in other words, that the number 
of positive values can never exceed the number of variations. 

Take, as an illustration, the equation, 

a;6 _ 4x5 + i2x' + 8.x3 + SO.r^ — x -f 15 = 0, 
and, multiply it by the factor, x — 2, the resulting equation will be, 

a;' — 6x« -f 20x5 — lOx'' + 14x' — 61x2 -f 17x — 30 = 0, 
and has gained three variations. 

501. It is plain that the preceding reasoning has been on the sup- 
position that a was a real value, otherwise we could not, in equation

494 DESCARTES' RULE. 

(M), have instituted any comparisons betweeij a and — P, — Pa, and 
4- Q, + R«> and — S, &c. In case, then, that there are imaginary 
values in an equation, the rule of Descartes only points out limits, be- 
yond which the positive and negative values cannot go. But, when 
the equation contains only real values, the number of positive values 
will be exactly equal to the number of variations, and the number of 
negative values exactly equal to the number of permanences. To show 
this, let m = degree of the equation, ?i = number of real negative 
values, p = number of real positive values, h = number of variations, 
b' = number of permanences. A slight inspection will show that, in 
case of real values, b + b' = 7n ; and we know that n + p = m. 
Hence, b -\- b' = n -\- p. But, since n cannot exceed b', and p cannot 
exceed b, we must have n = b'. For, if ra <^ 6', then necessarily 
p^ b, which cannot be. In like manner, we could show that we 
must havej9 = 5. 

Corollari/. 

502. In case of there being one or more missing terms in an equa- 
tion, the rule of Descartes will enable us to detect imaginary values. 
We have only to supply the missing terms with plus or minus zero 
coefficients, count the variations and permanences when the upper sign 
is taken, and then again, when the lower sign is taken. If there be 
any discrepancy in the results, there will be imaginary values. Thus, 
take cc^ + 4 = ; supplying the missing term, we have x^ ± Ox -^ 4: 
= 0. The upper sign taken in connection with the other two, gives 
two permanences, whilst the lower gives two variations. These dis- 
crepant results indicate imaginary values. 

Take x*-\-Sx^^4: = 0, then, x* db Ox' + Sx^ ± Ox — 4 = 0. 

In one case, we have one variation and three permanences ; in the 
other, three variations and one permanence. The difference in the two 
readings again indicates imaginary values.

503. When one quantity depends upon another for its value, it is 
said to be a function of the quantity upon which it depends. Thus, in 
the equation, y = 'Zx — 4, ^ is a function of x, because every change 
in the value of x will produce a corresponding change in the value 
ofy. 

The mathematical symbol to designate a function may be F, or/, 
or the Greek letter, $. Thus, to indicate that i/ is a function of x, we 
may employ the notation, y =. F(:c), or y =/(x'), ox y ^ 4'(a:)- The 
second member may contain constants, as well as the variable, x. Thus, 
3/ is a function of x in the foregoing equation, y = 2.x — 4, the con- 
stants being 2 and — 4. 

504. The most general form of an equation of the m*" degree be- 
tween two variables, x and y, is, 

cc" -f Bx"-' + Cx---^ + Dx"-^ + Ex"-^ + U = ; 

in which B, C, D, &c., are functions of ?/. 

B is supposed to be of the first degree in y, and of the form, 
a -\-hy. 

C is of the second degree in y, and of the form, c -\- cly -\- ey^. 

D is of the third degree in y, and of the form, f -\- gy ■\- hy^ + 1y^- 

E is of the fourth degree in y, &c. &c. 

U is of the m}^ degree in y, and of the form, u -f my + +!/°7 

and it does not contain x. 

505. The equation is said to be complete when x enters into all the 
terms but the last, y into all the terms but the first, and when, also, 
the sum of the exponents of x and y in each term is equal to m. 



496 ELIMINATION BETWEEN TWO EQUATIONS. 

506. Eliminatioa between equations of a degree higher than the 
first is usually effected by means of the greatest common divisor. This 
method of elimination has already been explained (Art. 214), but we 
propose to demonstrate the process more rigorously, in two ways, 

1. Let A = 0, and B = 0, be the proposed equations containing 
both X and y. 

Now, if we knew beforehand a value m of y, that was common to 
the two equations, A = 0, and B = 0, and substituted this value in 
them, the new equations. A' = 0, and B' = 0, would contain only x 
and constants. Now, if n be a value of a;, in the equation. A' = 0, 
its first member must be divisible by x — n, and it is plain that the 
given equations would not be simultaneous unless n would also satisfy 
the equation, B' = (Art. 207). Hence, x — n must also be a divi- 
sor of the equation, B' = 0. We see, then, that the hypothesis of a 
common value in y results in the condition of a common divisor in x. 
Conversely, if we can force the given equations to have a common 
divisor in x, they must have a common value in y. It is upon this 
principle that we seek for a common divisor between the first members 
of the equations, A = 0, and B = 0, and continue the process until 
we get a remainder freed from x. It is plain that, if we place this 
remainder equal to zero, and substitute the value of y, found from it in 
the last divisor, it will be an exact divisor, and will be the one sought. 

From the foregoing reasoning it is evident, that if it be absurd to 
place the remainder, freed from cr, eqvxal to zero, the given equations 
are not simultaneous. 

507. 2d. Let the successive quotients, in the process of dividing A 
by B, B by the remainder, &c., be designated by Q, Q', &c., and the 
successive remainders by R, R', &c. Then we will have. 

A = BQ 4- R, (M) 

B = RQ' + R', (N) 

• R = R'Q" + R", (0) 

&c. &c. 

Now, since, by hypothesis, A = 0, and B = 0, equation (M) will 
give R = 0. And, since B = 0, and R = 0, equation (N) will give 
R' := 0. From this we see that we have a right to equate, with zero, 
that remainder which is freed from cc, and contains only y. 

508. The above series of equations show, moreover, that if the re- 
mainder, which is freed from a-, and the preceding divisor be placed 



OF ANY DEGREE. 497 

equal to zero, the system of values so found will satisfy tlie given equations. 
For, if E." be that remainder, and R' the preceding divisor, when E,", 
and R' are equated with zero, equation (0) shows that R also = 0. 
And R and R' being equal to zero, from (N) we get, B = 0. And, 
since B = 0, and R = 0, equation (M) shows that we will also have 

A=:0. 

Hence, the values of ?/, found by placing the last remainder equal to 
zero, may be substituted in the preceding divisor, in order to deduce 
the corresponding values of x. The importance of this remark consists 
in the fact, that the preceding divisor is of a lower degree than either 
of the original equations, and, therefore, more readily solved. 

509. The reasoning in Art. 507 proceeds upon the supposition that 
the successive quotients, Q, Q', Q", are all finite, and then, of course, 
the successive products, BQ, RQ', R'Q", &c., will all be zero, when 
B = 0, R = 0, R' = 0, &c. But, if any of these quotients be frac- 
tional in form, it may happen that the value of y, found from placing 
the last remainder equal to zero, will reduce the denominator of the 
preceding divisor to zero also. In that case, we would have the 
product of zero by infinity, which is indeterminate.* Suppose, for 

4 
example, R = y — 1, Q = —^ . Then, A = BQ -f R becomes 

A = ^(-A—\ + y — 1 : or, when R = 0, A = B^ = B oc ; or 

V — y 

(since A and B are zero), ^ oo, which may, or may not be, a true 
equation. 

510. To avoid the fractional form of quotient, it may sometimes be 
necessary to multiply the dividend by some function of y, though this 
multiplication may possibly introduce some foreign values into the 
equation, as will be shown more fully hereafter. 

511. We will now illustrate the foregoing principles by a few 
examples. 

* Let 00 :iz A, dividing both members by 0, we get oo == — - =: oo, a true 

equation. And this will evidently be true when A = 1, 5, 10, 20, or anything 
whatever.

2(3y— 2)a:— 9/+12^— 4 
2d Remainder = 13^2—12^—28=0. 

From which we get y = 2, and y" = — i| ; and these, when sub- 
stituted in either of the given equations, give x' = 2, and x" = — 1|, 

Let x^ — / — 7 = 0, and a; — y — 1 = = 0. Combining, we 
will get a;^ + (^ + \)x + (/ + y) + (^ + 1) for a quotient, and 
/+ t/ — 2 for a remainder. 

The equation, formed by placing the remainder, freed from x, equal 
to zero, is called i\i.e final equation. In this example, the final equa- 
tion, y^ + y — 2 = 0, gives %f = 1, y" = — 2. And these values 
for y, when substituted, give x' — 2, and x" = — 1. 

Let x" — Syx^ + 3/a; — 5a;* -f lO^a; + 6a; — / — 5y^ — Qy = 0, 
and a;' — 6yx^ + Sy^x — x — 4/ -|- y = 0. Then the first quotient 
is -|- 1, and first remainder (2y — 5)x^ — 5y^x -\-7x + IQyx + By^ 

— 5/ — 7y. Preparing the last divisor for division by multiplying by 
(2y — 5)^, we have

and this, when divided by (2y — 5)x^ — by^x + 7x + lOyx + 3/ 

— 5/, gives as a quotient, (2y — 5)x — 5/ -f 15y — 7, and as a re- 
mainder y*x — 10/a; + B5y^x — bOyx + 24a; — y^ + lOy* — 35^' + 
50/ — 24y. And, by factoring this remainder, we get (/ — 10/ -f- 
35/ — bOy + 24)x — 3/(/ — 10/ + 35/ — 50y + 24) ; or, (a; —y) 
(/ — lOy^ + 35^2 — 50?/ + 24). Rejecting the factor, x — y, as 
leading to arbitrary values, we have the final equation, y* — lOy^ -\- 
35/ — 50y + 24 = 0. This equation, when solved by the process 
of divisors, gives y' = 1, / = 2, /" = 3, and y'"^ = 4. And these, 
when substituted, give x' = 3, x" = 5, x'" = 5, a;'^ = 7. 

512. Two things are suggested by this example. 1st. May not the 
multiplication by the factor, (2y — by, involving One of the unknown 
quantities, have introduced foreign values ; that is, values which did 
not enter the given equations ? 2d. x — y being a common factor to 



OP ANY DEGREE. 499 

the remainder, is found to be also common to both the given equations. 
How are such factors to be treated ? We will examine these subjects 
separately. 

513. 1st. In regard to foreign values, we have this simple test. 
Place the multiplier equal to zero, find the value for y, and, from either 
of the given equations, the corresponding values of .r ; if these values 
be the same as some of those found from the final equation for y, with 
the corresponding values of x, then the system of common values in 
both X and y must be rejected. In the example, placing {2.y — 5)* 
^ 0, we get i/ = I, a value difi'eient from those before found. Hence, 
the multiplier has not introduced a foreign value. But, if the multi- 
plier, placed equal to zero, had given us, for example, y = \, with the 
corresponding x = 3, then this system of values must be rejected. 

514. How are factors to be treated which are common to both of the 
first members of the given equations ? There may be three cases, but 
all lead to arbitrary values. 1st. The common factor may be a func- 
tion of X only, fix). 2d. It may be a function of y only, f{y). 3d. 
It may be a function of both x and y, f(x, y). 

When the common factor is /(x) only, x will have determinate 
values, and y indeterminate. For, by placing f(x) = 0, we will get 
true values for x ; but, when f(x) = 0, both equations will be satisfied, 
whatever values y may have. Take the equations, (a -\- hx') (x?y + 
2fx — ay) = 0, and (a -f hx) (Axhf — 2yx + my"-) = 0. Placing 

a + Ja; ^ 0, we get x = , and both equations will be satisfied 

when a + hx = 0, whatever may be the values of y. Hence, /(a;)=0 
gives x determinate, and y indeterminate. In like manner, a common 
factor, f(y), would give y determinate, and x indeterminate. In the 
the third case, the common factor, /(x, y) = 0, will satisfy both equa- 
tions ; but, since we have a single equation, f(x, y) = 0, containing 
two unknown quantities, the values of both x and y must be indeter- 
minate. Thus, take the equations, (2x — 4ty) (a? -}- ly — 5) = 0, 
and (2x — 4y) (xy — 1x^ + bx^ — 7/) = 0. It is plain that both 
equations will be satisfied when 2x — 4y = ; but the equation, 
2x — 4y = 0, will give indeterminate values for both x and y. 

Hence, we conclude that, when the given equations contain a com- 
mon factor, it must be divided out. For, a common factor, /(x), would 
give determinate values for x, but indeterminate for y; a common 
factor, f(y), would give determinate values for y, and indeterminate 



500 ELIMINATION BETWEEN TWO EQUATIONS 

for x; and a common factor, /(a;, ^), would give x and y, both inde- 
terminate. 

515. Take the equations, (x — 1) (x^ — 2xy -fa; — 2) = 0, and 
(x^ — XT/ — 2) (x — 1) = 0. Suppressing x — 1, we have x^ — 2xy 
+ X — 2 = 0, and x^ — xi/ — 2 = 0, from which we get y = 1, and 
x = 2. 

Take the equations, (2y — 6) (xy + 5a-?/ — y -f 1) = 0, and 
(2i/ — 6) (xy -f- 4y — 4) = 0. Suppressing 2y — 6, and combining 
the resulting equations, we get IQy^ — 53j/ -f 37 = for the final 
equation. From which, ?/' = 1, y = ^l, x' = 0, x" = — ||. 

Take the equations, (2x — 7y) (xi/ — y -f 5a;^ — 5a;) = 0, and 
(2a; — 7y) (xi/ -f- 7a; — 7 — y) = 0. Removing the common foctor, 
we get, after combination, 5a;^ — 12 -f 7 = for the final equation. 
From which, x' = |, x" = 1, and, by substitution, y' = — 7, and 

516. When the first members of the given equations can be resolved 
into factors of the first degree, or of a low degree, the elimination will 
be greatly facilitated. 

Take the equations, (x — 1) (?/x — 3) (a;^ — 2xy') — 0, and (^x — 
2a;) (x^ — 2^) = 0. 

These equations can, obviously, be satisfied when

517. One of the equations only may be capable of decomposition 
into factors. 

The equations may be of the form, A = 0, and BD = 0. We will 
then have two systems of values j one resulting from A = and 
B = 0, the other from A = and D = 0. 

Take the equations, 

xy — Ixy — 20x = 0, (A), and {xy — 5a; + 3) (x — 2) = 0, (BD). 
We get the system of equations, 

xY — Ixy — 20x = 0, (A), and cry — 5x + 3 = 0, (B). 
From which, x' = 3, and x" = |, y = 4, and y" := — |. 
(A) and (D) give xhf — Ixy — 20x = 0, and re — 2 = 0. 

, . , , ^ , 7-^^/209 ,, i — ^lm 

From which we get x =z 1, y = , y = -r . 

518. If any of the successive remainders be capable of decompo- 
sition into factors, which are functions of x or y, these factors may be 
placed, separately, equal to zero, and the deduced values of x or y sub- 
stituted in the preceding divisor. 

For, let B, be one of the dividends, R' the divisor, Q the quotient, 
and/(x) X f{y) the remainder. 

Then, |, = Q + -^/^l or R = R'Q + f{x) x /{y). 

And this equation will be satisfied when R' =: and /(x) = 0, or 
when R' = &nd/(y) = 0. 

Take the equations, yx'^ +y^x^ — x^ — y^x -^ yx -{- ]/ — 1=0, (R). 

and x^ — y + 1=0, (R'). 

Dividing R by R', we will geflfe remainder, (x^ + 1) (y^ — 1) 
Placing a;* -f- 1 = 0, we get x = ± -y — 1, and this, substituted in 
(R), gives 2/ = 0. Placing y^ — 1 = 0, we get y = =t 1, and these 
values, when substituted, give x' = 0, and x" = db y/ — 2. 
Hence, we have the system of values, 

a/=+ v/— 1| x"=—^— 1 1 x'" =z I a;'^ = y/—2\ x^ z= — ^A^ 
2/ = 0| y" = o\y"' = l\ y- = — 1| r = — 1 

All of which will satisfy the given equations. 



504 ELIMINATION BETWEEN TWO EQUATIONS 

519. When it is necessary to multiply (A) by either a function of 
* or 2/ to make it divisible by (B), we can tell whether the multiplier 
has introduced foreign values, by combining it, placed equal to zero, 
with B = 0. If any of the values thus found are the same as those 
resulting from the combination of the given equations, we must reject 
these common values from the solutions of the given equations. 

For, Jet A = 0, and B = ; and suppose that (A) will not be divi- 
sible by B until it has been multiplied by /(a;). Then we will have 
A(/x) = 0, and B ^ 0, which can be satisfied when A=0, and B =0; 
or, when f(x) = and B = 0. 

Now, it is plain that, if the combination of the new equation, 
A.f(w) = 0, with B = 0, gives, among its system of values, the same 
as given by /(a;) = 0, and B = 0, we must reject the common values 
as having been introduced by the multiplication of /(x). 

Take the equations, x^y — 2xy -{- x^ = 0, (A), and x^y — 2x^ -\- 
x = 0, (B). 

Multiplying (A) by x^, to prepare for division, we get for the final 
equation, a;^(x' ^• 2x^ — 5x + 2) :^ 0. From which we get, x = 0, 

, ^ „ — 3+VT7 ,„ —3—^17 „, -. 

X = 1, X = , X = ^ . The corresponding 

1 . / V 6v/T7-26 .„ _(26 + 6^T7) 

values of y are, v = ti, v = — =» ¥ = — ^^ =-^ 

"' ^ 38 — 10^17 38 + 10^17 

(M). 

Now, placing /(x) = 0, and B = ; or, x" = 0, and cc' — 2x^ + 
x = 0, we get x=zO, and y = § ; and, since these values are the same 
as the first of those, marked (M), we must reject them from (M), and 
leave but three values for x, and three for y. 

520. If A be exactly divisible by B, the values of x and y will be 
indeterminate. 

For, then, ^ =Q,; and, since A = 0, and B = 0, we will have 
B 

I] = Q, or = OQ . (P). Now, it k plain that Q may be /(cc), or 

f{y),oxf(x,ij). But, equation (P) will be satisfied, whatever may 

be the form of Q, and whatever may be the values of x or y. 

Take the equations, 

a;« _ ^x^y _ 2^'' 4- Zy^x" + 6xV — 2/'x — Qy^x + 2f = 0, 
and x' — 2xy + y' = 0. 

We get as a quotient, x^ — xy — 2x + 2y, and a remainder zero, 
and any value whatever of x, with the corresponding or deduced value 
of y, will satisfy both equations. 



OF ANY DEGREE. 505 



Remark. 



The case exhibited in 520, differs only from that in 514 in this 
respect, there is a common factor to the two equations in both instances, 
but 520 does not manifest that factor. 

The indeterminate nature of the given equations, when the final 
equation in y is zero in both members, may also be shown by retaining 
the trace of y. For, when we place the zero remainder equal to zero, 
we have Oy = 0, or 2/ ^ %■ 

521. When the final equation reduces to a constant, the value of y 
will be infinite, and the given equations will be contradictory. 

For, then we will have 0^/ = A, constant ; or ^ = 00, the symbol of 
absurdity. 

Hence, the combination of the given equations has led to an absurd- 
ity, and, therefore, these equations must be contradictory. 

Take the equations, y^ — 0? — Sx* + 9 — Zx = 0, 

and y — x — 1=0. 

Combining, we will have, for the final equation, 10 = 0; or, retaining 
the trace of y, 10 -f Oy = 0, or y = — 'gO = 00, 
The given equations are not simultaneous.
